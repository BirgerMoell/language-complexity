# 🇸🇪 Swedish Language Complexity Analysis 📊

Welcome to our comprehensive project that compares various methodologies for calculating language complexity in Swedish. This research combines traditional linguistic techniques with state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide a thorough analysis. 🔬

## 🗂 Project Structure

- `data/`: Repository of Swedish text samples for analysis 📚
- `results/`: Output directory for analysis results and visualizations 📈

## 🛠 Methodology

1. Environment setup:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Data analysis:
   ```
   python calculate_complexity.py
   python analyse_results.py
   ```

3. Results interpretation: Examine the output in the `results/` directory 🔍

## 🧠 Core Components

- `llm_complexity.py`: Implements AI-driven complexity analysis using GPT-4 and traditional LIX score calculation for Swedish texts. This module combines computational linguistics with machine learning approaches. 🤖🧑‍🔬

- `calculate_complexity.py`: Contains algorithms for various complexity metric calculations, providing a multi-faceted approach to text analysis. 🧮

- `analyse_results.py`: Performs statistical analysis on the complexity results, generating comprehensive summaries and insights. 📊

- `complexity_analysis.csv`: Raw data output from our analysis, serving as a foundation for further research. 💾

- `complexity_summary.txt`: Curated report highlighting the most complex, least complex, and median complexity texts, offering a spectrum of linguistic complexity. 📋
