# 🇸🇪 Swedish Language Complexity Analysis 📊

Welcome to our exciting project that compares various methods for calculating language complexity in Swedish! We're mixing traditional techniques with cutting-edge Large Language Models (LLMs) to bring you the most comprehensive analysis. Let's dive in! 🏊‍♂️

## 🗂 Project Structure

- `data/`: Our treasure trove of Swedish text samples for analysis 📚
- `src/`: The heart of our project - all the source code for complexity analysis 💻
- `results/`: Where the magic happens - output directory for our amazing analysis results ✨

## 🛠 Usage

1. Set up your secret lab:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the analysis and watch the magic unfold:
   ```
   python src/main.py
   ```

3. Discover the results in the `results/` directory - prepare to be amazed! 🎉

## 🧠 What's Inside?

- `llm_complexity.py`: Our AI-powered complexity analyzer using GPT-4 and traditional LIX score calculation for Swedish texts. It's like having a linguist and a robot working together! 🤖🧑‍🔬

- `calculate_complexity.py`: The brains of our operation, containing various complexity metric calculations. It's crunching numbers faster than you can say "komplicerad"! 🧮

- `analyse_results.py`: Our data detective, analyzing the complexity results and generating insightful summaries. It's connecting the dots and painting the big picture! 🕵️‍♀️🎨

- `complexity_analysis.csv`: The raw results of our analysis - a goldmine of data waiting to be explored! 💎

- `complexity_summary.txt`: The highlight reel of our analysis, showcasing the most complex, least complex, and middle-of-the-road texts. It's like the Oscars, but for text complexity! 🏆

## 🚀 Get Involved

We're always looking for fellow language enthusiasts and code wizards to join our quest for understanding Swedish text complexity. Feel free to fork, star, and contribute to this project. Together, we can unravel the mysteries of the Swedish language! 🇸🇪✨

Remember, in the world of language complexity, we're not just crunching numbers - we're decoding the very essence of communication. So put on your linguistic hat, fire up your code editor, and let's make language analysis fun! 🎈🥳
