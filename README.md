# Language Complexity Analysis

This project compares various methods for calculating language complexity in Swedish, including traditional techniques and Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains Swedish text samples for analysis
- `src/`: Source code for complexity analysis
- `results/`: Output directory for analysis results

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the analysis:
   ```
   python src/main.py
   ```

3. View results in the `results/` directory

## Sample Code

For LLM-based complexity analysis, refer to `src/llm_complexity.py`:
