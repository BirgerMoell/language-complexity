Sammanfattning 
 
Det här examensarbetet har som mål att genomföra den svåra jämförelsen av olika  
persontransportmedel i Stockholm stad. Både energikonsumtion samt luftföroreningar har 
jämförts. De valda transportslagen är bil, buss och tunnelbana. 
 
Traditionellt sett så har järnvägsindustrin haft just miljöargumenten som en stark fördel när det 
gäller passagerartrafik. Men de senaste åren har bilindustrin fått mer och mer utrymme I media 
när det gäller miljöfrågor. T.ex. Roger Kemps uttalande att bilen är de mest miljövänliga 
passagerartransportmedlet i UK. Den härs studien kommer att visa på de miljömässiga fördelarna 
med järnvägsbaserad trafik i städer. 
 
Världens energikällor är inte oändliga och användandet av dem som finns påverkar miljön på 
olika sätt. På grund av detta så är det av yttersta vikt att kunna fatta de mest miljövänliga 
besluten I det långa loppet. 
 
Tunnelbanans resultat var de bästa i alla kategorier (utsläppsämnen) förutom när det galled CO2 
där biogasbussen var bäst. Tunnelbanan kom dock in på en stark andraplats. Ett förvånande 
resultat var att tunnelbanan när den drivs av el producerad enligt värsta tänkbara sätt (marginalel) 
hade så goda resultat jämfört med bil och buss. Den hade högsta resultat I en av kategorierna, 
SOx. Men i de övriga resultaten (kostnad för samhället, sek/pkm) blev den bara slagen av de 
andra elektricitetsmixarna som kan driva tunnelbanan. 
 
Ett av de mest intressantaste områdena att titta på är jämförelsen av de olika resescenarier som 
har satts upp i rapporten. De visar tydligt att i de flesta fall är tunnelbanan inte bara de mest 
miljövänliga utan även ett bra alternativ när det gäller restiden. Detta är extra tydligt vid 
jämförelsen av kostnad för samhället har analyserats. Dessa resultat visar att det vore en bra 
investering för samhället att få Stockholms invånare att välja tunnelbanan oftare. Detta skulle 
sänka den genomsnittliga använda energimängden samt mängden utsläpp till luft per person vad 
det gäller resor. Det skulle även ytterligare öka produktionen av miljövänlig el vilket skulle 
gynna den sektorn iom att SL endast köper in el som är producerad av vatten eller vind. Genom 
att öka beläggningsgraden för både bus och tunnelbana kan dessa transportsätt bli ännu mer 
 
- ii - 
energieffektiva. Tilläggas bör också att den genomsnittliga beläggningsgraden för tunnelbanan är 
40 % vilket betyder att det finns en stor förbättringspotential för tunnelbanan. 
 
När man undersöker resultaten pekar allt på att det är alltid bättre att använda tunnelbanan så 
länge den är eldriven än bilen som för de mesta är driven av bensin eller diesel. Även när 
tunnelbanans resultat baseras på den värsta möjliga elen (kolkondenskraft) så har den ändå långt 
lägre inverkan på hälsan och miljön vad bilen har. Den dieseldrivna bilen är mer än 32 gånger så 
kostsam för samhället än vad tunnelbanan är och den bensindrivna är mer än 15 gånger så 
kostsam. 
 
Det här examensarbetet visar att järnvägsindustrin fortfarande kan använda miljövänligheten 
som ett starkt argument när det gäller persontrafik i Stockholms stad.

Abstract 
 
This master thesis sets out to compare the different public transport modes in Stockholm city. 
Both energy consumption and air pollution are compared. The chosen transport methods are car, 
bus and metro. 
 
Traditionally the rail industry has had environmental arguments as a strong competitive 
advantage when it comes to passenger transportation. However, in recent years the automotive 
industry has been getting more positive media attention regarding environmental issues, for 
example Roger Kemp’s statement that the car is the most environmental friendly passenger 
transportation mode in the UK. This study will show the environmental advantages of railway 
traffic in cities. 
 
The energy sources of the world are not endless and the use of the different sources affects the 
environment in different ways. Therefore it is of highest importance to be able to choose the 
most environmentally sound alternative in the long run. 
 
The Metros results were the best in all categories except for CO2 were the biogas bus had the 
best results, though the Metro came in on a strong second place. One surprising result was that 
the metro based on the worst-case scenario (marginal electricity) had such good results. It had 
one result that was the highest of them all, SOx. In the overall standings (cost for the society, 
sek/pkm) though it was only beaten by the other electricity mixes for the metro. 
 
One of the most interesting parts to look at is the comparison of the different travel scenarios set 
up in this report. They clearly point out that in most cases the metro is not only the most 
environmentally sound alternative but also a good alternative if you consider the travel time. 
This is clearly visible in the comparisons where the costs for the society have been analyzed as 
well. The results of these costs show that it would be a very good investment for the society to 
focus on getting the citizens of Stockholm to choose the metro more frequently. This would help 
to lower the average amount of energy used per person on travel as well as lowering the amounts 
of air pollution. It would also further help to increase the production of environmentally friendly 
electricity due to the fact that SL only buys electricity produced by hydro and wind power. Also 
 
- iv - 
by increasing the load factor on both buses and the metro these transport methods could be even 
more effective. The average load factor for the metro is 40 % so the metro also has a high 
potential to become even more energy sufficient. 
 
When examining the data it clearly points out that it is always better to choose the metro, when it 
is fuelled by electricity, than the car that is for the most part fuelled by petrol or diesel. Even 
when the metro is forced to use the marginal electricity production (coal condensing power) it 
possesses a far less impact on the health and the environment than the car. The diesel driven car 
is more than 32 times as expensive for the society as the metro and the petrol car more than 15 
times as expensive. 
 
This thesis shows that the rail industry can still use environmental argument as a strong 
competitive advantage when it comes to passenger transportation in Stockholm city.

1 Introduction 
 
1.1 Background 
Traditionally the rail industry has had environmental arguments as a strong competitive 
advantage when it comes to passenger transportation. However, in recent years the automotive 
industry has been getting more positive media attention regarding environmental issues, for 
example Roger Kemp’s statement that the car is the most environmental friendly passenger 
transportation mode in the UK [Kemp, 2004]. This study will show the environmental 
advantages of railway traffic in cities. 
 
Global warming, caused by green house gases, is commonly considered to be one of the major 
environmental threats for the future. In the year 2000, 35 % [Stenkvist, 2002] of all the green 
house gases discharged in Sweden originated from transports. Therefore it is important to focus 
on finding a solution to this problem. 
 
The energy sources of the world are not endless and the use of the different sources affects the 
environment in different ways. Therefore it is of highest importance to be able to choose the 
most environmentally sound alternative in the long run. 
 
To show the benefits of the railway sector Bombardier Transportation and the department of 
Aeronautical and Vehicle Engineering at the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm 
have written a report, where they present the energy efficiency and emissions from medium and 
long-distance transports using railway vehicles. In connection to that report this Master of 
Science thesis at the department of Machine Design at KTH has been done. The study presents 
energy consumption and emissions to air from cars, buses and the metro in Stockholm. 
 
The Swedish government has set up 16 environmental objectives. The transport sector affects 
most of the environmental issues covered by these objectives. It is of importance that the 
environmental objectives that have been set up will be reached. It is also important to know from 
where to start if these goals are to be reached. Are the goals that are set possible to reach with 
small or big changes? This report shows the environmental impacts that the different transport 
modes in Stockholm causes today and compares them with each other. It will also shed some 
light on the economic affects caused by the discharges.   
 
The objectives are: 
• Reduced Climate Impact 
• Clean Air 
• Natural Acidification Only 
• A non Toxic Environment 
• A Protective Ozone layer 
• A Safe Radiation Environment 
• Zero Europhication 
• Flourishing Lakes and Streams 
• Good-Quality Groundwater 
• A Balanced Marine Environment, Flourishing Coastal Areas and Archipelagos 
• Thriving Wetlands 
• Sustainable Forests 
• A Varied Agricultural Landscape 
• A Magnificent Mountain Landscape 
• A Good Built Environment

• A Rich Flora and Animal Life 
 
1.2 Aim of this study 
The aim of this study is to compare the energy consumption and the emissions to air from 
commonly used passenger transport modes in Stockholm. 
 
1.3 Previous studies and information sources 
 
Emissionsjämförelse mellan buss och bil (Emission comparison between bus and car) 
This report is made by Ecotraffic, SLTF and Västtrafik and has the aim to compare energy 
consumption and emissions between buses and cars. Data from buses was collected from buses 
in Gothenburg, and car-data was collected from previous Ecotraffic reports. [Ahlvik et al., 2001] 
The report is very thorough and has taken many aspects under consideration. In this report two 
different bus routes are analyzed, the first one is a bus line that operates from one suburb to 
another suburb via city. The other line is an inner city bus line. The first line is characterised by a 
rather high average speed, with few stops. The second bus line is characterised by short intervals 
between the stops and a rather slow average speed. Both these types of bus lines are 
representative for the bus traffic studied in this report and are therefore of interest. The quality of 
the data in this report is considered to be high; for example, NTM (The Network for Transport 
and Environment) uses this data in their calculation program NTMcalc. In the report Ecotraffic 
used no calculation program when calculating emissions from buses, Ecotraffic considered using 
COPERT since it is the most commonly used method within the EU. However COPERT was 
excluded since it was not adaptable enough to fulfil the aim of the study. Ecotraffic have instead 
used an emission factor to estimate the total amount of emissions caused by travelling by 
different types of buses. In order to make this number more accurate, corrections were made 
depending on the load factor, driving pattern, cold starts and ageing. Some aspects that could 
also affect emissions were not included, for example net- and gross kilometre. These are 
excluded because the effect is considered to be very small and there has not been any work done 
on these aspects that can be considered of required quality. The most important conclusion in 
they made in this study is that it is not trivial to compare the emissions and health effects of 
emissions between busses and cars. 
 
To shift or not to shift 
This is a report made in the Netherlands. The study is of very high quality and a number of 
different modes of transport are compared. This study does not only include passenger transport 
but also freight transport. The focus of this study lies on the future potential for each mode of 
transport. The emission factors analyzed in this report are carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides 
(NOx), and particles (PM10). 
 
EMV 
The EMV-model is developed on request from The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency, 
NV (Naturvårdsverket). It is a computer program used for calculating the fuel emissions from 
road traffic. It puts out totals regarding emissions including cold starts and evaporation. 
Appropriate areas to use is larger communities and upward. The EMV-model is used by the NV 
and the SRA (the Swedish Road traffic Association). EMV can both be seen as a calculation 
model and a database.  
 
Input data: traffic data, emission factors, car register data, usage of vehicles, fuel description, 
fuel usage, probability of scraping. The emission factors for heavy traffic are based on the 
VETO-model. The cold start-factors are based on COLDSTART.  
 
 
 
- 3 - 
Output data: emissions (HC, CO, NOx, particles, CO2, SO2, Pb), fuel (petrol, diesel, alcohol, 
gas), presentations with different subdivisions (country side and densely populated areas, type of 
vehicle, fuel type). 
 
NTM 
In Sweden there is an organization called the Network for Transport and the Environment 
(NTM). NTM consists of representation from all different branches within the transport sector, 
and they are working on finding out ways to measure environmental impacts that can be 
accepted by all different branches. NTM also aims to spread knowledge on environmental issues 
and initiate research and development. On their homepage they provide a service, called 
NTMcalc, where it is possible to compare the environmental impact from different modes of 
transport depending on the type of journey that is going to be made. NTMcalc uses data from the 
report Emissionsjämförelse mellan buss och bil (Emission comparison between bus and car) 
when calculating emissions from buses. In the case of cars the calculation model EMV is used.

2 System boundaries 
2.1 Geographical limit 
The geographical limit has been set to the area where the metro is operating (see figure 1). 
Within this area people have a good possibility to choose between all the different modes of 
transport. To drive a car within this area is fairly simple and a common transport mode. The bus 
communications are also good. The metro does not operate during the night, but during these 
hours it is replaced by bus services so it is possible to choose public transport during all hours of 
the day. 
 
 Figure 1. Area covered by the Stockholm metro. 
 
2.2 Modes of transport 
The reason for this study is to compare the different modes of passenger traffic in Stockholm. 
The most important modes and also the dominating are cars, buses and railway traffic. Hence, 
public transport will be compared with cars. There are only two railway traffic modes that have 
their entire track within the geographical limits of this report; these are the metro and a tram 
called Tvärbanan. However the data available for Tvärbanan was not sufficient and therefore the 
metro is the only railway traffic mode analyzed in this report. 
 
In public road transport the only mode of transport are busses. In the suburbs diesel buses are 
operating and within the city borders the buses are operating on either ethanol or bio-gas. These 
public transport modes will be compared with cars. Cars will be divided into diesel and petrol 
cars, which are the most dominating and commonly used car types today.

This gives that the following modes of transport are compared in this study 
 
The Metro 
Buses: 
• Diesel buses 
• Ethanol buses 
• Bio-gas buses 
Cars: 
• Diesel cars 
• Petrol cars 
 
2.3 Compared factors, emissions 
This report focuses on the energy consumption, and related emissions, from different transport 
modes. The energy consumption is presented in kWh per passenger kilometres. To compare the 
environmental impact from the different transport modes the related discharges must be 
determined. The type and amount of discharges are related to the energy source (oil, electricity, 
gas, etc.) used in that particular transport mode. The discharges (the environmental effect 
factors) are presented in grams per passenger kilometres. It is only the emissions from the 
respective energy source that the different transport modes consume, which are presented. 
Emissions that derive from production of the specific vehicle or from building and repairing the 
necessary infrastructure needed to use the different transport modes are not included. 
 
The emissions included in this report are: 
 
• Carbon dioxide, CO2 
• Nitrogen oxides, NOx 
• Sulphur oxides, SOx 
• Carbon monoxide, CO 
• Particles 
• Hydrocarbons, HC (VOC) 
 
2.4 Energy utilisation and backtracking 
When analyzing energy consumption and emissions it is important to decide how far back in the 
energy production process to track the different energy sources and which energy consumption 
to include or not. For example most of the emissions from vehicles using electricity as their 
source of power originate from the manufacturing of electricity, while the propulsion causes the 
majority of the emissions generated from vehicles operating on fossil fuels. 
 
In Andersson [2006] the energy consumption is divided into eight different purposes, these are: 
1. Propulsion 
2. Comfort during the journey 
3. Idling outside scheduled service 
4. Stationary vehicle heating 
5. Complementary runs 
6. Maintenance of vehicles 
7. Operation and maintenance of fixed installations 
8. Heating of buildings and other premises serving the rail transportation system 
 
Andersson uses purpose 1 to 3 when calculating energy consumption and air pollution for 
railway traffic. The emissions included in this report, however originates from; production and 
distribution of the energy source, from the propulsion of the vehicle, from comfort during the 
 
 
- 7 - 
journey and complementary runs, i.e. purpose 1, 2, 3 and 5. These emissions sources are easy to 
compare for the chosen transport modes. The reason for excluding, for instance, stationary 
heating is that it is difficult to estimate the energy used to heat cars and buses stationary; they 
vary much from one user to another and is hard to isolate. For the same reasons this report 
exclude the production, repairing and recycling phases of the specific vehicle and from building 
and repairing the necessary infrastructure needed to use the various transport modes. 
 
2.5 Time factors 
When looking into the environmental effect from different transport methods it is important to 
take the time factor into consideration. The environmental effect of one mode of transport can be 
different during peak and off-peak hours, since the load factor and the traffic flow may vary at 
different times of the day. For example the load factor is high for the metro during peak hours 
and low for cars. The results in this report will be presented in different time segments based on 
the peak and off peak hours of the public transport.

3 Energy sources 
3.1 Electricity 
3.1.1 Electricity mixes 
The Stockholm metro is powered by electricity. There are several different ways to generate 
electricity. The major difference between these methods is which type of electricity mix that 
should be used when calculating. Four different types of electricity mixes will be used in this 
report. These are “green electricity” (which SL actually buys from E On) [SL, 2005], the 
Swedish mix, the Nordic mix and marginal electricity. 
 
Green electricity 
Today SL has a contract with E On (formerly Graninge), where they buy so called “green 
electricity”. This mix contains 95 % hydropower and 5 % wind power [www.graninge.se]. SL 
has taken an active choice to buy environmentally sustainable electricity. Changing the 
electricity production in a more environmentally sustainable way is of vital importance; therefore 
it is of big interest to use this mix in the calculations of emissions. It should be possible to reap 
the benefits of contributing to a more environmental friendly electricity production. It is also the 
actual electricity that SL buys and therefore it is this type of electricity and the emissions 
connected to it that SL contributes with when they use electricity for their railway traffic. 
 
Swedish mix 
This is the actual production of electricity in Sweden the year 2004 (See Appendix 3). The 
Swedish electricity mix is used in this report mainly for two reasons; firstly Sweden is practically 
self-sustained when it comes to electricity production. This means that all electricity demanding 
operations can sustain solely on Swedish electricity. Secondly it is of interest to have figures 
based on the Swedish production when comparing emission values from Sweden with other 
countries using a different electricity mix. All import-export in the mix has been disregarded. 
This is due to the fact that Sweden produces more electricity than it uses (see appendix 3). So 
even if there is Danish produced electricity in the Swedish power grid, at least the same amount 
of Swedish electricity is exported to the Nordic or European power grids as well. This justifies 
doing the calculations of the Swedish mix without the import-export data. 
 
The Nordic mix 
The Nordic mix is used when calculating emissions from electricity production since electricity 
companies in Sweden actually buy and sell their electricity on Nordpool (the electricity market 
in the Nordic countries). This mix gives a wider picture on the effect of using electricity in 
Sweden. This is because using electricity in a Nordic country is more like using electricity 
produced in all of the Nordic countries, due to our constant exchange of electricity via Nordpool. 
Also the Nordic countries import and export of electricity to and from countries outside the 
Nordic countries is relatively small with a net import of 4.4% [www.nordel.org, 2003]. The 
Nordic countries constantly import and export electricity with each other and through this 
exchange they influence the type of electricity produced. In the calculations the import-export 
taking place with the rest of the world is disregarded for the same reasons as stated for the 
Swedish mix. In the Nordic mix the same data regarding emissions is being used as in the 
Swedish mix. In the Nordic mix the same data regarding emissions is being used as in the 
Swedish mix. This is due to the lack of data on foreign power production plants. The same break 
down structure as for the Swedish mix is also used for the different type of power sources in the 
Nordic mix. For example this means that the CHP break down structure for the Nordic mix is 
exactly the same as for the Swedish (see appendix 3).

Marginal electricity - Worst case scenario 
Marginal electricity is the electricity that has to be produced when all other types of electricity 
production are being used to their full capacity. All new (marginal) electricity consumption 
strikes on the most expensive (but flexible) power production form. When calculating the 
amount of emissions from marginal electricity coal fuelled condensing power from Denmark 
should be used. This is the recommendation from the Swedish Energy Agency (STEM) [STEM, 
2002]. Since no data for a Danish coal fuelled condensing power plant was found, data for a 
corresponding Swedish power plant was used instead. In Sweden the marginal electricity is an 
electricity production type with a higher amount of air pollution than the Swedish mix. This 
method will be referred to as the worst-case scenario in this report. 
 
In table 1 the four different electricity mixes with their individual production method breakdown 
structures are presented. More exact production figures of the Swedish and the Nordic mixes can 
be found in appendix 1 and 3.

The emissions and energy consumption from production of electricity are presented in appendix 
2. 
 
All emission data from electricity production are taken from [Uppenberg et. Al., 2001]. 
 
The results of the calculations on emission data from electricity production can be found in table 
2.

Calculations 
For calculation purposes some simplifications and assumptions was necessary to do. 
 
The amount of electricity produced in the CHP-plants (Combined Heat and Power-plants) using 
only the condensing power is added to the amount of electricity produced in the pure condensing 
power plants. This means that the emission data from electricity produced in the CHP-plants 
without using the heat for district or industry heating are treated in the same way as if they were 
produced in an ordinary condensing power plant. 
 
Emission data regarding gas turbines is considered to be the same as condensing power fuelled 
by gas. 
 
No data could be found on the exact breakdown structure on the CHP-plants regarding bio fuels 
and natural gas (see appendix 3). So in this report the calculations regarding bio fuels are based 
on four kinds of wood fuels (Salix, Wood fuels, Pellets and RT-flis) because these are the most 
used bio fuels, [www.effektiv.org, 2005]. An assumption is also made that all the fuels are used 
in the exact same amount. This is done in order to be able to get an average value that can be 
used in the electricity mix calculations. Regarding natural gas the assumption is made that the 
main part comes from Denmark; therefore in this report the calculations are based on natural gas 
produced in Denmark. 
 
In CHP-production both electricity and heat are produced at the same time. Some sort of 
allocation is therefore necessary to do. To calculate the total environmental effect of energy 
production in a CHP-plant the alternative production method or the energy method can be used. 
The alternative production method is presented in PSR 1998:1 revision 1 “Produktspecifika 
regler för certifierade miljövarudeklarationer för el- och fjärrvärmeproduktion” [PSR, 2000]. The 
result of this method is that the environmental impact from electricity production per produced 
kWh is much higher than the production of heat. The calculations and explanations on this 
method can be found in appendix 5. The energy method uses the assumption that the 
environmental impact of the production of heat and energy is considered to be the same. This 
method is a more fair way to allocate the environmental impact in this case due to the fact that 
the electricity is only produced when the heat is needed. The energy produced when no heat is 
used for is used for district or industrial heating has already been discussed (see above). It is this 
that ensures that the total efficiency of the CHP-plant is 90%. So when electricity is produced 
from a CHP-plant a very small waste of the fuels energy takes place. The conclusion is therefore 
that the energy method will be the method chosen regarding the allocation of emissions to air 
end energy consumption for the CHP-plants in this report. 
 
No energy consumption data for production and distribution of coal could be found. This means 
that the calculation for the electricity production where coal is used has been done without this 
extra amount of energy. This affects the results in a positive way regarding the energy 
consumption as well as the amount of air pollution (i.e. in the reality these results are higher).

3.1.3 Losses from electricity production 
The losses included for the electricity production in this report are: losses during production and 
distribution, losses in the metro’s electrical power grid and losses in the public electric power 
grid. 
 
Losses during production and distribution 
The data gathered in this report for the different production methods of electricity is taken from 
IVL and the report Miljöfaktabok drivmedel och bränslen [Uppenberg et. al., 2001]. This report 
has taken into consideration the losses from both production of the used energy source and the 
losses from the actual production of electricity.  
  
Losses in the metro’s electrical power grid 
In this report the calculations of energy consumption in the metro are based on the total amount 
of electricity that SL has bought from E.on regarding the metro. This means that all the losses in 
the internal power grid for the metro are included.  
 
Losses in the public electric power grid 
In this report data for the electrical production is taken from Svensk Energi (see 12.3 Appendix 
3). In this data the losses in the public power grid are stated.  
 
Power grid losses = 2 762.3 GWh 
 
Electrical usage including the losses = 146 271.3 Gwh 
 
The loss factor = 146 271.3 / (146 271.3 – 2 762.3) = 1.0192 
 
This means that all calculations regarding electrical usage are increased with the loss factor. By 
doing this the losses in the public grid are included. When using 1 kWh 1.0192 kWh has been 
produced. It is important to include these losses because it is the actual amount of produced 
electricity (not the used) that is gives birth to the total amount of pollution.

3.2 Fuels for road vehicles 
3.2.1 Fuel types 
 
Traditional fuels 
Road vehicles have been, and still are, mainly powered by diesel or petrol. In Sweden petrol is 
the most common fuel for light vehicles, cars, and diesel is the most common fuel for heavy 
vehicles such as buses and trucks. 
 
Alternative fuels 
Due to environmental and political reasons the interest on alternative fuels for road traffic has 
grown. The usage of alternative fuels has started to increase, especially within public transport. 
In Stockholm about 17% of the bus fleet uses a different fuel type than diesel [www.frida.port.se, 
2005] and by 2011 this number is planned to be 50% [www.sl.se, 2007]. The most common 
alternative fuel is ethanol with 15.1% of the fleet and in second place is Biogas with 1.3%. 
 
3.2.2 Emission data from fuels for road vehicles 
When calculating emissions from road vehicles there are several different calculation programs 
that could be used, the most commonly used in Europe is Copert. However in this study the 
program, NTMcalc is used, since it is considered to give results closest to the situation in 
Sweden today. NTMcalc is available on the NTM homepage. 
 
3.2.3 Losses from fuels for road traffic 
In NTMcalc the background data includes the entire life cycle for the fuels. Therefore losses 
from production and distribution are included in the figures presented for all road vehicles.

4 Metro 
4.1 Metro types 
The Stockholm metro uses two different types of metro vehicles, one old and one new. The 
vehicle called C6 from the early 1970:s here represents the old type. The newer type of vehicle 
called C20 was taken into traffic in 1996. The C6 can be combined in to a train consisting of up 
to eight cars, and is today used in trains with either eight or six cars. The C20, which is longer 
can be combined into trains with up to three C20s, and is today used in trains with either two or 
three C20s. Calculations in this report are based on an approximation on how many trips are 
made with each type of metro train, the majority of all trains are long and the shorter trains are 
only used in off-peak hours, and most of the trains are of the C20 type. The three C20 train can 
seat 378 passengers. However since some journeys are made with trains that seat fewer 
passengers the assumption was made that the average train in the Stockholm metro can seat 336 
passengers. 
 
4.2 Metro data 
The metro’s emissions have been calculated on the emissions originating from the production of 
electricity consumed by the metro. The results regarding the metro are calculated using four 
different electricity mixes. These are Green Electricity, the Swedish mix; the Nordic mix and the 
Worst-case scenario, which is Danish, coal condensing power (see chapter 3.1). 
 
SL does not have an automatic system to count their passengers today and therefore their 
statistics are not as accurate as preferred. The number of passenger are counted when passengers 
pass through the barriers, however not all passengers pass through these, why random counts are 
carried out manually, by using these results the total number of passengers is estimated, 
[Fredriksson, 2003]. This estimation makes the statistics slightly defective. However, when 
handling this large number of passengers this defect in the statistics does not affect the final 
amount of emissions per passenger kilometre noticeably. The number of supplied kilometres is 
taken from a database (see table 3 for the exact supplied amount of kilometres). The database 
includes all the planned trips and it also includes all the planned back-up traffic. The database is 
not updated with unplanned back-up traffic, cancelled trips or temporary timetable changes 
[Fredriksson, 2003]. Overall this parameter has a high quality. When it comes to distances 
between stations for the metros they are very exact, as they have been taken from blueprints of 
the metro provided by SL. 
 
SL has provided data for the energy used for the metro. This data is divided into two different 
types of electricity, high-voltage current and low-voltage current. The high-voltage net supply 
includes propulsion, comfort during ride, electrified third-rail heater, and idling indoors 
(stationary heating). The low voltage part includes such consumptions as heating and lightning 
of stations and maintenance halls, lightning of tunnels and electricity for signal boxes etc. In this 
report emissions that originates from propulsion and comfort during the journey, idling outside 
scheduled service and complementary runs are included. Therefore only the consumption from 
the high voltage part will be included in this study (see table 3 for the amount of consumed 
energy). This means that some excess electricity will be included, however since the stationary 
heating takes place when the vehicles are indoors in a preheated area, this will not affect the final 
results much.

4.3 Emission calculations 
The major part of the emissions from the metro originates from the electricity production and 
therefore depends on which electricity mix that is used, however a small part also originates 
from the actual production and distribution of the fuels used in the different electricity 
production methods. In order to make this comparison as accurate as possible, these emissions 
are also included in the study. 
 
4.4 Energy consumption 
The energy consumption for a mode of transport can be presented in different ways. In this 
report it is presented in three different ways, per vehicle kilometre, per passenger kilometre 
(based on the average load factor) and per seat kilometre (see diagram 1). Energy consumption 
per passenger kilometre shows the actual situation with today’s average load factor, and is 
interesting for a comparative reason. The figures for energy consumption per seat kilometre give 
a picture of the potential that a vehicle type has if the load factor could be raised. All these 
results are calculated from data provided by SL (see table 3). However, the energy consumption 
has also been measured for C20, the newer type of metro. The manufacturer, Bombardier, made 
the measurements over one year between May 1999 and April 2000. The result from this study 
was presented in kWh/seat-km and gave the result of 0,041 kWh/seat-km. The results were also 
presented in vehicle kilometres and were 5.19 kWh/vkm for one C20, which would give 15,57 
kWh/vkm for a full-length metro train. The difference in the calculated result and the measured 
result is explained by the fact that in the calculated result some excess energy is included, for 
instance from stationary-heating, and electrified third-rail heater. Also the fact that some traffic 
using the old type of metro train is included in these figures can affect the results. The old type 
of metro car does not have any energy recovery, and therefore uses more electricity.

5 Buses 
5.1 Bus types 
Several different bus types are used within the geographical limits of this study. To make the 
comparison easier four different types of buses was chosen to represent the fleet operating in 
Stockholm. In the areas surrounding the city centre of Stockholm buses are driven on diesel. All 
buses in traffic within the city centre of Stockholm run on renewable energy sources. The 
majority of these buses run on ethanol. Today there is only one bus line in Stockholm that is 
operated by biogas-fuelled buses. SL plans, however, to increase the number of biogas operated 
buses as much as possible. SL buys their biogas from the sewage-plant in Henriksdal. This 
sewage-plant has the potential to produce enough biogas to fuel 120-130 buses, however SL are 
looking in to buying biogas from other plants in the local area as well. The four types of buses 
analyzed in this study can be seen in figure 2. 
 
 
 
Figure 2; A: Diesel Bus, B: Ethanol 2-axle Bus, C: Ethanol 3-axle Bus and D: Biogas Bus. [www.bussfoto.com]. 
 
5.2 Bus data 
As for the metro, the buses in Stockholm lack an electronic ticket system to count passengers. 
Some of the buses in the fleet are however equipped with the so-called ATR-system. This 
system, using photocells, counts passengers going on and off buses. Since not all buses are 
equipped with this system, the operating companies are bound to rotate these buses so that they 
run on different lines, and on different hours of the day. When this data is collected an external 
company makes an estimation of the total number of passengers, using an algorithm based on old 
counts and travel habit studies. The fact that there are not automatic counts on each journey does 
make the results slightly less accurate; however the estimated amount of passengers on buses in 
Stockholm is regarded as being close to the actual amount of passengers. [Fredriksson, 2003]. 
 
When it comes to the supplied kilometres for buses in Stockholm the same method as for the 
metro is used. The number of supplied kilometres is taken from a database. The database 
includes all the planned trips and it also includes all the planned back-up traffic. The database is 
not updated with unplanned back-up traffic, cancelled trips or temporary timetable changes. 
Therefore these figures can be considered reliable and close to the truth. 
 
 
- 22 - 
The technical data concerning different bus types have been collected from SL and the Web site 
www.miljofordon.se, for instance fuel consumption and number of seats. On the SL-homepage 
information regarding which type of buses operates on different lines can be found. Facts about 
energy sources have been collected from a report made by IVL, Fakta om bränslen, Facts about 
Fuels. The collected data is presented in table 4.

5.3 Emission calculation 
The major part of emissions from buses originates from combustion in the engine, however a 
small part also originates from the production and distribution of the fuels used. In order to make 
this comparison as accurate as possible, these emissions are also included in the study. 
 
The emissions from the buses have been calculated using the program NTMcalc, which can be 
found on the NTM homepage. The aim for NTMcalc is to reflect the situation in Sweden today 
and this method is therefore considered to be the best suited for this report. In NTMcalc, a lot of 
factors can be varied and the data collected for buses has been used in order to make the results 
as close to the situation in Stockholm as possible. Variables that can be chosen by the user are; 
fuel consumption, load factor, type of fuel, driving pattern (urban or country-side) and bus type 
(city bus or long-distance bus). NTMcalc uses the data from the study, Emissionsjämförelse 
mellan buss och bil (Emission comparison between bus and car), mentioned in chapter 1.3. For 
more information regarding used parameters see Appendix 4.

6 Cars 
6.1 Car types 
The cars have been divided into two types, petrol cars and diesel cars. These two types have been 
chosen since they are the most common in Stockholm. The cars used in this report are based on 
an average car in Stockholm as it is presented on the NRA homepage. 
 
6.2 Car data 
The car data used in this study is presented in table 5. Fuel consumption of the average car was 
collected from the NRA homepage and the fuel data from the IVL report Miljöfaktabok 
drivmedel och bränslen. 
 
Table 5. Car data.

2 Production and distribution are included, [Uppenberg et. al., 2001] 
 
6.3 Emission calculation 
As for buses, the calculation service NTMcalc on the NTM homepage was chosen when 
calculating emissions for cars. This service is also adaptable for cars and the user can choose for 
example; driving pattern, fuel-type, load factor, fuel-consumption and age of the vehicle. 
NTMcalc uses the EMV-model, mentioned in chapter 1.3 when calculating emissions from cars. 
The parameters (regarding the above choices) used in this report can be found in appendix 4. 
 
6.4 Energy consumption 
In diagram 16 the energy consumption for the different car types can be found. The energy 
consumption is presented with 1-5 passengers in the car; this is due to the fact that when 
choosing between taking the car or using public transport the number of passengers in the car is 
in most cases known. Therefore it is more interesting to know how much energy that is 
consumed depending on the number of passengers rather than the average load factor.

7 Travel scenarios 
It is not always possible to compare different transport modes. For example it is not realistic to 
compare a bike with an airplane if you are travelling from Stockholm to New York. This is of 
course an extreme example but the same type of problems occurs in a city as well. Not all 
destinations can realistically or relatively fast be reached with all different transport modes. 
Sometimes it is also not economically justifiable to choose a certain type of transport mode. This 
is why six travel scenarios have been constructed. In these scenarios the effects of a journey 
between two actual addresses in Stockholm are presented. To make a comparison, the actual 
distance that the bus or metro travels to transport a passenger between two points must be 
compared with the distance that a car travels between these points. Therefore this study of the 
different scenarios is of interest. For example when driving a car it is not always possible to 
choose the shortest route between destination A and B, some roads might be one-way or closed. 
And when reaching the final destination, a parking place must also be found. For busses and the 
metro such problems may not occur, however the bus and the metro cannot (in the most cases) 
drop a passenger of at their exact destination point. These questions must be taken in 
consideration and that is another reason why the travel scenarios have been set up. When 
comparing the different modes of transport in these scenarios the average energy consumption 
and emissions will be used. 
 
7.1 Scenarios 
Different scenarios have been set up. These scenarios represent three different types of common 
journeys in Stockholm. In all scenarios it is possible to travel by public transport and by car. The 
trips were made on a Saturday with moderate traffic. The journeys with car were made in both 
ways because it is not always possible to travel on the same roads due to one-way streets etc. 
 
The car used during the scenarios was a 2003 Audi A3 1.6. The car was driven a total of 94,3 km 
during the day and approximately 13,42 litres of petrol was consumed. Energy consumption and 
emissions from these scenarios are presented with both the Audi A3 used during the study and 
also the car data using an average petrol car that is described in chapter 6.2. 
 
The buses used during the scenarios are described in chapter 5. 
 
Data for the metro can be found in chapter 4. 
 
In chapter 8.2 the effects on health and the environment are translated into costs for the 
community. Data for both local and regional costs are presented. These data are used to calculate 
the community’s cost for each travel scenario. In the case of the bus and the car, data for the 
local emissions are based on the Stockholm data (see table 11). And for the metro data emission 
effect data for a small community (Laholm) have been used instead of the local Stockholm data 
due to the fact that the electricity is produced outside of the densely populated areas (see table 
11). On top of this the regional costs have been added (see table 12). 
 
The results are presented in chapter 9.4.

8 Emissions 
8.1 Effects on health and the environment 
Automotive vehicles and power plants produce a number of air pollutants that pose risks to the 
health and to the environment. To be able to translate the results, of the different transport modes 
emissions, into effects on the health and the environment an understanding of the different 
effects that each emission type can cause is needed. It is also interesting to know how they affect 
the environmental goals set up by the Swedish government (see table 10). 
 
The effect of emissions from road traffic and power plants can be divided into four different 
geographical dimension groups, depending on how they impact the environment. 
 
• Global – emissions that affect the entire globe, e.g. green house gases. It does not matter 
where these emissions first occurs. 
• National – nations can have set up rules for maximum amount of emissions. 
• Regional – emissions that affect the smaller or larger areas (regions) close to the source. 
E.g. acidifications. 
• Local – emissions that affect on a local area (city, public places, indoors). E.g. emissions 
that can affect the health of people close to the source. E.g. PM10, ground level ozone. 
 
The emissions from road traffic and power plants affect both nature and human health.  
The following is a summary of the main pollutants produced by road traffic and power plants 
Stated are also in which way they contribute to health and environmental problems. The 
emissions from both road traffic and power plants consist of many different pollutants. In this 
report only the air pollutants where information could be found, for both road traffic (cars and 
busses) and the different electrical production mixes (green, Swedish, Nordic), are presented.

Carbon dioxide, CO2 
Carbon dioxide is formed during all combustion processes of organic compound. When 
combustion of fossil fuel takes place carbon dioxide is reinserted to the atmosphere. The fossil 
fuels have been buried underground for millions of years. This means that they have not been 
part of the cycle in nature for the same amount of time. Every time fossil fuel is used for 
combustion the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will increase. Carbon dioxide 
is one of the most important greenhouse gases due to the sheer amount that is released through 
the use of fossil fuels [Uppenberg et. al., 2001]. 
 
When measuring the CO2 in the exhaust it is important to know that there are non combusted 
compounds (CO and HC) that when they are fully oxidised will form water and CO2. This means 
that if you calculate the CO2 based on how much carbon the fuel include a higher value will be 
found. It can therefore at a first glance seem to be negative from a green house gas point of view 
with a complete combustion in the engine and the use of a catalysator because of the increase of 
CO2 compared with older cars that don’t oxidize these compounds as effective. But this is not 
true because the non combusted compounds are much more potent green house gases which 
mean that it is a clear advantage to have a complete combustion. 
 
Nitrogen oxides (NOx) 
Nitric oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) are collectively known as NOx. The later one is 
the most hazardous one of them. These are created during high temperature combustion 
processes from the oxidation of nitrogen that is present in the air and nitrogen compounds found 
in fossil fuels. Road transport is the single biggest source of discharge in most urban areas 
[www.miljomal.nu]. This leads to that the greatest concentrations of NOx are found in urban 
areas where traffic is the heaviest. Road traffic is responsible for approximately half of the NOx 
emissions in Europe [www.airquality.co.uk]. The amount of nitrogen oxides in the air is a good 
indicator of the amount of air pollution that has been discharged from road traffic 
[www.miljomal.nu]. Other important sources are power stations, heating plants and industrial 
processes. The amount of NO2 in the exhaust is often relativey low but in the atmosphere NO 
oxidizes into NO2 and then into saltpetre acid. The amount of NO2 in the air is often above the 
threshold values for good air quality in the densly populated areas [Ahlvik et. al., 2001]. 
 
Nitrogen oxides can irritate airways, especially the lungs this can lower the resistance to 
respiratory infections such as influenza. The amounts of Nitrogen oxides that are present in the 
Swedish urban areas can cause problems for people with asthma or respiratory lung problems 
[www.miljomal.nu]. Children that are continuously exposed to concentrations of nitrogen oxides 
that are much higher than normally found in the air are more likely to experience incidences of 
acute respiratory illnesses [http://www.airquality.co.uk]. 
 
In the nature nitrogen oxides causes acid rains and also contributes to the eutrophication. NO2 is 
also a key factor in the formation of ground level ozone [www.miljomal.nu]. NOx are also a 
more potent green house gas than CO2. 
 
Sulphur Oxides, SOx 
Sulphur oxides are the collective name for SO2 and SO3. SO2 is the dominating gas of the two in 
the exhaust but SO2 oxidizes into SO3 in the atmosphere. Sulpur dioxide is an acidic gas, which 
combined with water vapour in the atmosphere produces acid rain. The principal source of this 
gas is power stations burning fossil fuels, which contain sulphur. The emissions of SO2 now only 
tend to occur in cities in which coal is still widely used for domestic heating, in industry and in 
power stations. The last 40 years have seen a drastic decline in SO2 emissions. This is due to 
lower sulphur content in oil, purification of the emissions from power production plants and a 
decrease of the use of coal (domestic, industrial and in power generation) [http://miljomal.nu]. 
 
 
- 40 - 
Both wet and dry depositions have been implicated in the damage and destruction of vegetation 
and in the degradation of soils, building materials and watercourses through acid rains [Brandt 
et. al., 2000]. The amounts of sulphur dioxide in the air in Swedish urban areas are so low that 
hardly any provinces should have any problems fulfilling the environmental goals set up by the 
government. 
 
SO2 in ambient air can also affect human health, particularly people suffering from asthma and 
chronic lung diseases. Even moderate concentrations may result in a fall in lung function in 
asthmatics. Tightness in the chest and coughing occur at high levels, and lung function of 
asthmatics may be impaired to the extent that medical help is required. Sulphur dioxide pollution 
is considered more harmful when particulate and other pollution concentrations are high 
[www.airquality.co.uk, 2006]. 
 
Carbon Monoxide, CO 
Carbon monoxide (CO) is a colourless, odourless and toxic gas, which is emitted into the air as a 
result of combustion processes, and is also formed by the oxidation of hydrocarbons and other 
organic compounds. Carbon monoxide emissions increase when conditions are poor for 
combustion; thus, the highest carbon monoxide levels tend to occur when the weather is very 
cold or at high elevations where there is less oxygen in the air to burn the fuel. The amounts of 
CO in the exhaust when the engine starts cold are much higher than when the engine is warm 
[Ahlvik et. al., 2001]. In European urban areas, CO is produced almost entirely (90%) from road 
traffic [www.airquality.co.uk]. It survives in the atmosphere for a period of approximately one 
month but is eventually oxidized to carbon dioxide (CO2). CO has a higher impact on the 
climate then CO2. So a oxidization into CO2 does actually help in lowering the climate impact 
from green house gases. The amounts of CO in the air have gradually diminished, mainly 
because of the catalysatic exhaust cleaning in petrol driven cars [Ahlvik et. al., 2001]. High 
emissions mainly occur in wintertime due to the effects of cold start of petrol driven cars. There 
are some indications that CO can affect the atmospheric chemistry by it’s ability to reduce the 
oxidization of VOC:s and thereby contribute to the effects that can be allocated to VOC:s. Other 
indications are that the amount of ozone can increase due to CO. The specific reactivity although 
is very low for CO in comparison to VOC components but because of the fact that the emissions 
of CO often is many power of tens higher than for individual VOC:s CO can have some affect 
even in this consideration. 
 
This gas prevents the normal transport of oxygen by the blood because it binds the red blood 
cells together [Ahlvik et. al., 2001]. This can lead to a significant reduction in the supply of 
oxygen to the heart, which can be particularly dangerous for people suffering from heart disease 
[www.airquality.co.uk, 2006]. The effect of being exposed to CO remains for several hours 
[Ahlvik et. al., 2001]. 
 
Particles (PM10) 
Airborne particulate matter (PM) is, according to the definition used in testing of vehicle 
exhaust, all the matter that can be collected on a testing filter in a temperature that is lower than -
52 °C. The exhaust must be diluted with air to lower the temperature under tihis level. By using 
this method also non combusted fuel remains, oil, sulphates (from the fuels sulphur) and bound 
water, etc., gets filtered besides from the particles. PM varies widely in its physical and chemical 
composition, source and particle size. These tiny particles contain many substances, including 
metals, acids, carbon, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). Some of these particles are 
emitted in vehicle exhaust, while others are formed in the atmosphere. These are formed through 
chemical reactions between the various pollutants found in exhaust and the power plants 
emission to air. But they are also formed by wear on the road surface, mainly when studded tires 
are used. PM10 or PM2.5 particles (the fraction of particulates in air of very small size (<10 µm 
 
 
- 41 - 
or <2,5 µm ) or fine particles as they are called are of a major concern. This is due to the fact that 
they are small enough to penetrate deep into the lungs and by that pose significant health risks. 
Though most of the particulates in the air stems from other sources than vehicle exhaust it has 
shown that the combustion processes part (including vehicle exhaust) of the smallest particulates 
are dominating in comparison with other sources [Ahlvik et. al., 2001]. 
 
They can cause inflammation and a worsening of the condition of people with heart and lung 
diseases. They may also carry surface-absorbed carcinogenic compounds into the lungs 
[www.airquality.co.uk, 2006]. Almost all particulate matter from road transport is PM2.5 
[www.epa.gov, 2006]. Larger particles are visible as dust or smoke and are not as easy to inhale. 
They are also removed relatively efficiently from the air by natural sedimentation 
[www.epa.gov, 2006]. 
 
Hydrocarbons, HC, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC:S) and Non-Methane Volatile 
Organic Compounds (NMVOC)  
Hydrocarbons are chemical compounds that contain hydrogen and carbon. Hydrocarbon-based 
fuels such as gasoline and diesel power most motor vehicles and engines and are also common in 
some power production plants that run on oil and coal. Hydrocarbon pollution results when 
unburned or partially burned fuel is emitted from the engine as exhaust, and also when fuel 
evaporates directly into the atmosphere. Hydrocarbons include many toxic compounds that cause 
cancer (for example benzene) and other adverse health effects as well as compounds that are 
relatively harmless from a health point of view (for example methane). Hydrocarbons, which 
may take the form of gases, tiny particles, or droplets, come from a great variety of industrial and 
natural processes. In typical urban areas, a very significant fraction comes from cars, buses, 
trucks, and other mobile sources such as construction vehicles and boats. The relative health 
dangerousness in HC is strongly dependent on the fuels composition. Here in lies the biggest 
advantages with alternative fuels and the reformulating of conventional fuels. 
 
The VOC:s are a large family of carbon-containing compounds that evaporate easily. Engine 
exhaust contains a number of different VOC:s. They are released either as unburned fuels or as 
combustion products, and are also emitted by the evaporation of solvents and motor fuels. Some 
of them, such as benzene and 1,3-butadiene, are cancer-causing agents [www.airquality.co.uk]. 
The main sources of benzene in the atmosphere in Europe are the distribution and combustion of 
petrol where combustion by petrol vehicles is the single biggest source (70% of total emissions) 
[www.airquality.co.uk, 2006]. 1,3-butadiene (like benzene) is a VOC emitted into the 
atmosphere principally from fuel combustion of petrol and diesel vehicles [www.miljomal.nu]. 
HC takes part in the forming of ozone. High levels of HC is a sign of that the combustion 
process or the after treatment of the vehicle exhaust do not work properly, i.e. the system works 
bad from a technical point of view [Ahlvik et. al., 2001]. HC is also a more potent green house 
gas than CO2. 
 
Possible chronic health effects include cancer, central nervous system disorders, liver and kidney 
damage, reproductive disorders, and birth defects [www.airquality.co.uk, 2006]. Benzene can 
cause leukaemia [www.miljomal.nu, 2006]. 
 
Methane, CH4  
Methane is a part of the hydro carbons (HC) and is a powerful green house gas. It is 
approximately 25 times more effective than CO2 [Uppenberg et. al., 2001]. It is a significant part 
of the traffic exhaustions and therefore it must be taken into consideration when calculating the 
total amount of green house gases.

8.2 To put a cost on the effects 
One method of trying to put a value on the environmental effects of the different emission 
factors is to translate them into costs. To the present day this is limited to air pollution and noise. 
The effect of a certain pollutant of a certain magnitude varies depending on the size of the 
population that it is exposed to. Due to this the discharge is valued different depending on the 
size and the ventilation conditions of the community where the actual discharge has taken place. 
 
The following is taken from the report SIKA Rapport 2002:12 and some complementing values 
from Swedish Road Administration, 2001:40. 
 
As mentioned above, emissions cause local, regional and global environmental effects. These 
numbers are for road traffic only and do not take into consideration for example the height of the 
emission point. This comes into play when calculating on the emissions from power plants. 
Regardless of this we have used these numbers for the power plants as well. 
 
Local effects 
Local effects from road traffic and power plants are mainly health related and caused by 
particles, NOx, SO2 and VOC:s. In addition they also lead to pollution of buildings and the 
surrounding area due to all of the particles and to corrosion caused by particles, nitrogen oxides 
and sulphur dioxide. In the valuation of the local effects from air pollution mainly the health 
effects have been taken into consideration. In the case of particles pollution of buildings and the 
surrounding area has been included. Corrosion has not been included.

2001:s price level.

Regional effects 
Regional effects from road traffic and power plants are damages to the environment due to 
discharges of nitrogen oxides, sulphur dioxides, hydro carbons (including PAH, poly aromatic 
hydro carbons). The regional effects of the emissions have been valued indirectly from a political 
standpoint.

Global effects 
The global effects are contributions to the global warming and effects on the ozone layer in the 
stratosphere. Discharge of carbon dioxide, methane, dinitrogen oxide and the airline industries 
nitrogen oxides affects the global warming. The discharges of dinitrogen oxides and the airliners 
discharge (on high altitudes) in the stratosphere of steam and nitrogen oxides affect the ozone 
layer.

10 Discussion and conclusions 
10.1 Data quality 
 
Data for the metro 
A lot of studies have previously been made when it comes to emissions and energy consumption 
in areas regarding passenger transportation. Most of these are very general and gives a picture of 
the average travel situation in Sweden. In this report the main focus has been on finding a fair 
picture for the situation in Stockholm. 
 
The main part of the report was finding relevant data for the metro, something that has not been 
done before. This includes electricity production data, the amount of used electricity and setting 
up relevant boundaries for the study. SL has provided most of the information regarding data for 
the metro. SL lacks an automatic passenger counting system and the data for supplied kilometers 
does not include unplanned backup traffic and cancelled trips. These facts causes a slight defect 
in the results, however the data for the metro is considered to be of high enough quality and there 
is no real need to make a harder effort to increase the quality of these results. When SL 
implements their electronic ticket system this data will, however become more exact. Data for 
energy consumption is based on total amount of energy that SL buys. It was not possible to 
separate the different parts of electricity consumption in order to get only the data that is covered 
by the system boundaries of this report. However the division of the electricity consumption that 
SL had (high voltage and low voltage) meant that the only excess electricity comes from 
stationary heating indoors and the electrified third-rail heater and this is such a small part of the 
total amount of electricity that it does not affect the final result. 
 
One of the most challenging parts was to find and calculate the electricity production data. In this 
part we had to make some simplifications and assumptions. We chose to present four different 
electricity mixes, the green mix, the Swedish mix, the Nordic mix and the worst-case scenario 
(coal condensing power). The composition of the mixes was retrieved from Nordel and their 
annual report from 2003. This data is solid and reliable. Here we had to make some 
simplifications regarding the import/export of electricity. We made the assumption to disregard 
the import and export of electricity. This we did due to the fact that Sweden produces more 
electricity than it uses (see appendix 3). In the Nordic mix the same data regarding emissions is 
being used as in the Swedish mix. This is due to the lack of data on foreign power production 
plants. The same break down structure as for the Swedish mix is also used for the different type 
of power sources in the Nordic mix. For example this means that the CHP break down structure 
for the Nordic mix is exactly the same as for the Swedish (see appendix 3). 
 
The emission data was taken from Miljöfaktabok drivmedel och bränslen by IVA. This is an 
extensive study of different LCA-reports on emissions deriving from distribution and production 
of different power sources. This data also is of very high quality. Some information about the 
exact structure and amount of different fuels and data some of the fuels for CHP-plants was not 
available, so therefore we made some assumptions. All of these assumptions are explained in 
detail in section 3.1.2. It is our belief that these assumptions are reasonable and as close to the 
reality as possible. No energy consumption data for production and distribution of coal could be 
found. This means that the calculation for the electricity production where coal is used has been 
done without this extra amount of energy. This affects the results in a positive way regarding the 
energy consumption as well as the amount of air pollution (i.e. in the reality these results are 
higher). 
 
 
 
- 68 - 
Data for road vehicles 
In an early stage of this study it was decided that emissions for road vehicles should be 
calculated using NTMcalc. NTM has used background data that reflects the situation in Sweden 
well today. And by choosing the right parameters to use in the calculations this program can give 
answers that reflect the situation in Stockholm rather well. Even though the data for fuel 
consumption is based on the actual cars registered in Stockholm this data only shows their 
average consumption. And if factors like traffic jams and driving patterns had been possible to 
take into consideration the results for cars would probably have been even worse for specific 
scenarios. The actual fuel consumption value for the cars is based on their official consumption. 
This value originates from test cycles and therefore does not correspond with the reality. This 
remark is of course of most relevance when it comes to travels in Stockholm city and not the 
outskirts. Buses on the other hand are not as affected by the traffic situation at different hours of 
the day, due to special lines for buses etc. The data for fuel consumption on buses are taken from 
a couple of different places, which could affect the results slightly. For instance diesel 
consumption is based on all SL buses and they have both 2-axle and 3-axle buses and therefore 
the fuel consumption is possibly slightly to high, since the data for seats are based on the 2-axle 
version. While the fuel consumption on the 3-axle ethanol bus is based on figures taken from a 
web site for environmental vehicles and is based on this vehicle type’s average fuel consumption 
and not on the exact figures in Stockholm. The data for road vehicles might not be of as high 
quality as the data for the metro. But they are definitely good enough to be used for a 
comparative reason. 
 
When it comes to emissions they are not always that easy to compare since different reports 
choose to present their data in different ways. This has been most apparent in the case of 
hydrocarbons. In the data for electricity production there has been a division between methane 
and NMVOC while other reports combine these two and present only VOC emissions. Thirdly 
some reports also include non volatile organic compounds and therefore presents the data for all 
hydrocarbons combined, HC. Another area where results are presented different is sulphur 
oxides where some presents SO2 and others present SOx (SO2 and SO3). This results in 
diagrams that actually compare slightly different things but because of the fact that SO2 is the 
dominating gas of the two we feel that this comparison is justifiable. 
 
However the purpose of this report was to find high quality data for the subway and the data 
collected are considered to be of high enough quality to use in a comparative situation with cars 
and buses. 
 
10.2 Comments and discussion of the results 
 
Most of the results were very close to what we had expected on forehand. But we would like to 
high lighten some of the more deviant results presented in this thesis. 
 
When examining the results we found that three different variations on the transport modes had 
almost equally bad results. These were the diesel car, the petrol car and the diesel bus. We were 
not surprised to find the cars among the poor performers but the fact that the bus did as bad came 
as a surprise. The diesel bus though have a high potential to lower the kWh/pkm and the 
corresponding air pollutions by increasing the load factor, which is quite low with only 30%. The 
car on the other side has also a high potential if it could raise the load factor from today’s 
average level of 36% (default value from NTM-calc). To raise the load factor for the cars could 
prove to be a bit more challenging due to the fact that the car is used for the comfort and its 
convenience. The owners of the car seldom have common travel routes that prevent the 
possibility to raise the load factor. Many cars also are owned and used by only one person. 
 
69 
 
The Metros (green mix) results were the best in all categories except for CO2 were the biogas 
bus had the best results. One surprising result was that the metro based on the marginal 
electricity had such good results. It had one result that was the highest of them all, SOx. In the 
overall standings (cost, sek/pkm) though it was only beaten by the other electricity mixes for 
the metro. The average load factor for the metro is 40% so the metro also has a high potential 
to become even more energy sufficient. One very interesting result is that with the average 
load factor of the metro (134 passengers) today the metro is still more energy efficient than 
the average petrol car with a load factor of 100% (i.e. 5 passengers) (see diagram 63).

10.3 Areas where the results of the thesis can be of use 
 
The results can be used as guidance during political decision-making. This enables the 
politicians to steer the decision-making in the right way from an environmental point of view. 
An easy and uncomplicated way of showing the differences between the different transport 
modes that is in use today. This enables the citizens of Stockholm to make a fair and balanced 
decision regarding which transport mode that suits their needs best. Today commuters have at 
least three areas of concern when they decide how they should commute. The first area is the 
time factor, how long the travel time is with the different modes, second is the cost factor, how 
much does the different alternatives cost and now a third question how will the different 
transport modes affect the environment. This report helps the commuter to make a more fact-
based answer to the third question. This is in our view the most important question and it is about 
time that this has come up for discussion in the media. Today it is possible to see the carbon 
dioxide exhaust from the car you are interested in buying in your every day newspaper. This is a 
step in the right direction. This report and others like it can help to raise the awareness of all the 
different emissions that are released with the exhaust from either electricity production or cars 
and buses. 
 
10.4 Recommendations for future studies 
 
We have found many areas of possible improvement that can be of use in more extensive studies 
in the future. 
 
• More comprehensive studies regarding data for road vehicles. 
• More comprehensive studies regarding data and calculations for the electricity 
production. 
• More comprehensive studies regarding different types of losses. 
• Increase the number of compared emission types. 
 
 
- 71 - 
• More focus on the environmental and health effects of the different emission types. 
• Compare more alternative fuels and or transport modes, e.g. electric-, gas-, ethanol- and 
fuel cell cars and buses. 
• More comprehensive studies regarding driving patterns and traffic jams in Stockholm 
city. 
• Study the effect of the congestion charges in Stockholm City. 
• The cost for the society could benefit from including more pollutants.  
• Most studies would benefit from increasing the number of investigated pollutants. This 
would of course help to give a more accurate picture of the reality. 
 
10.5 Conclusions 
 
In recent times we have all been bombarded by the fact that the environmental effects from green 
house gases have reached dangerous levels. Everybody knows that we must change our way of 
living but few seem to be willing to do any real changes. Therefore it is very important to show 
what you can actually do today without to many changes and how big of an impact your different 
choices can have. This is where this thesis comes in to play. The way you choose to transport 
yourself impacts the environment in a big way. 
 
One of the most interesting parts to look at is the comparison of the different travel scenarios set 
up in this report. They clearly point out that in most cases the metro is not only the most 
environmentally sound alternative but also a good alternative if you consider the travel time. 
This is clearly visible in the comparisons where the costs for the society have been analyzed as 
well (see table 13). The results of these costs show that it would be a very good investment for 
the society to focus on getting the citizens of Stockholm to choose the metro more frequently. 
This would help to lower the average amount of energy used per person on travel as well as 
lowering the amounts of air pollution. It would also further help to increase the production of 
environmentally friendly electricity due to the fact that SL only buys electricity produced by 
hydro and wind power. Also by increasing the load factor on both buses and the metro these 
transport methods could be even more effective. 
 
When examining the data it clearly points out that it is always better to choose the metro, which 
is fuelled by electricity than the car that is for the most part fuelled by petrol or diesel. Even 
when the metro is forced to use the marginal electricity production (coal condensing power) it 
possesses a far less impact on the health and the environment (se table 13) than the car. The 
diesel driven car is more than 32 times as expensive for the society as the metro and the petrol 
car more than 15 times as expensive. 
 
It is a difficult and somewhat dangerous task to compare different transport modes as mentioned 
earlier in this report. But by using good system boundaries and common sense the results gives a 
good indication of how the different transport modes affect environment. These results can then 
be compared with each other. In a more comprehensive study this is something that can always 
be even more examined. 
 
This thesis shows that the rail industry can still use environmental argument as a strong 
competitive advantage when it comes to passenger transportation in Stockholm city.
