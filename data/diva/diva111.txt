Abstract 
Increasing the energy effectiveness among existing block of flats is a very important part in 
achieving future demands on reduced energy consumption in the society. To increase the 
acceptance for and encourage to make block of flats more energy-saving one apartment 
building from the 19th century have been chosen for transformation to more energy-saving. 
Four essential aspects are treated throughout this paper for each construction part within the 
climate shell. These aspects are Caution, Energy, Moisture and Profitability. By taking 
constructional measures it is proven that today’s demands on the climate shell and significant 
decrease of the specific energy use can be achieved. This is reached without distorting the 
important historical characteristics of the house by a high consideration of demands for 
caution. Furthermore chosen measures are evaluated, if they have a negative effect on affected 
construction parts from a moisture point of view. Finally it is shown that many of the 
measures taken are profitable.
