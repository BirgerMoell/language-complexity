Sammanfattning 
Detta examensarbete är en utvärdering av sandwichmaterialet Hybrix användbarhet inom 
karosskonstruktion för personbilar. Syftet med arbetet är att utvärdera en teoretisk 
implementering av Hybrix i en bilkaross där underlaget sedan skall ligga till grund för vidare 
utvärdering i ett större utvecklingsprojekt. Hybrix är ett innovativt, rostfritt sandwichmaterial 
som består av två väldigt tunna plåtar separerade av miljontals stålfibrer. Konstruktionen är 
helt i austenitiskt, rostfritt stål och den är sammanfogad med ett elastomerlim. 
Tonvikten av arbetet har lagts på att undersöka lämpliga fogningstekniker för att sammanfoga 
Hybrix och galvaniserad plåt. Fokus har också lagts på att undersöka vilka korrosions-, ljud- 
och vibrationsegenskaper som kan förväntas vid en eventuell karossimplementering. 
Två komponenter från Opel Insignias kaross studerades för att kunna bestämma vilka faktiska 
problem och fördelar som kan uppstå vid användandet av Hybrix. Dessa kallas rear floor 
respektive dash panel. Punktsvetsprover utfördes på Hybrix samt kombinationsfogen mellan 
Hybrix och galvaniserad plåt. 
Resultatet från punktsvetsprovningen var dåligt och svetsarna kunde inte godkännas. Vad 
gäller korrosion så konstateras att galvanisk korrosion kommer att bli ett problem med dagens 
fogningsteknik. Detta resulterade i ett antal förslag på alternativa fogningsmetoder som tillåter 
elektrisk isolering mellan Hybrixkomponenten och övrig karosskonstruktion. En av dessa 
metoder är att clincha med adhesiv som isolator. Svetsskruvar kan inte fästas till dash panel 
som önskat och detta resulterade i förslag på fästning av skruv på en konsoll som monteras på 
dash panel i Hybrix med hjälp av en dubbelhäftande tape vid namn VHBTM. 
Slutsatsen är att Hybrix är ett interssant material för bilkaross men att många problem måste 
lösas först. Tester måste utföras för att ta reda på Hybrix ljud- och vibrationsegenskaper, 
förmåga att clinchas samt pressningegenskaper.

Abstract 
This M.Sc. thesis is a material application evaluation commissioned by the advanced body 
engineering department at SAAB Automobile AB. The purpose of the thesis is to evaluate 
implementation of the innovative sandwich design material Hybrix into an automobile body. 
Today the most commonly material used in the body is galvanized steel sheets and by shifting 
material to Hybrix several problematic issues have to be dealt with. Hybrix is an innovative 
sandwich sheet that inherits thin stainless steel face sheets and a stainless steel fibrous core. 
The focus during the project has been to investigate problems concerning joining techniques, 
corrosion and noise and vibration behavior. To get a grip of what might cause problems a 
thorough pre study on each of the three areas has been carried out. 
To determine specific matters that concerns components in the body two specific components 
were investigated, these were the rear floor and the dash panel. Resistance spot welding is the 
most commonly used joining technique in the body, therefore a spot weld test was carried out 
on Hybrix. To determine the quality of the welds post weld material tests were conducted. 
The biggest corrosion issue was stated to be galvanic corrosion due to the dissimilarity in 
nobility between galvanized steel and Hybrix. This resulted in proposals of alternatives to 
spot welding where the Hybrix component would be electrically isolated from surrounding 
body work to avoid galvanic cells to be formed. The most suitable joining technique proposed 
is Eckold clinching combined with adhesive. Weld studs on the dash panel can be attached to 
the Hybrix component by welding the stud to a console that can be joined to the dash panel 
with double adhesive tape. The components are formed through deep drawing and it is not 
possible to simulate deep drawing of Hybrix as of today. The weld tests clearly show that the 
weldability of the combination of Hybrix and galvanized steel is very poor. This means that 
some alternative for spot welding must be used.  
It is concluded that the weldability of Hybrix and galvanized steel is very poor and that the 
galvanic corrosion issue can be solved by electrically isolating Hybrix. It is also concluded 
that tests within the areas of noise and vibration, forming and Eckold clinching has to be 
conducted.

CHAPTER 1 
1 INTRODUCTION 
CHAPTER INTRODUCTION 
This chapter describes the background, the purpose, the limitations and the method used 
during the project. A short time plan and risk analysis is also presented. 
1.1 Background 
SAAB Automobile AB is a low volume automobile producing company.. The first SAAB 
automobile prototype ever was presented to the press in June 1947. Since then, SAAB has 
been focusing on technically advanced vehicles on the global automobile market. 
Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are one of the main sources of global warming. By lowering 
these emissions, global warming will decrease. One way to address this problem is to lower 
the emissions originated from automobiles. This can be achieved in several ways. One is to 
lower the weight on the car so that the power demands on the engine decreases resulting in 
lowered CO2 emissions. 
SAAB Automobile AB is an environmentally friendly driven company that has already 
implemented several good ideas in their automobiles to lower the impact on the environment 
throughout the whole automobile life cycle. A lighter automobile body would be one step 
further towards making environmentally friendly automobiles. 
There are a huge amount of different light weight materials on the market today. Not all of 
these are suited for an automobile body. If you are looking for a replacement for structural 
steel sheet there are not that many of these light weight materials that stand fast to the 
demands on the automobile body. A type of material that the automobile industry has been 
glancing on for decades is the sandwich design. Sandwich designed materials has been 
developed throughout the years and may finally be suitable for your every day automobile. 
An innovative sandwich material named HybrixTM marketed by the Swedish company Lamera 
AB is a very interesting material in many ways. It is made mostly out of stainless steel and is 
light, strong, formable and suitable for many common manufacturing methods of today. 
Though, implementing a new material in an automobile body is not as simple as one would 
think. There are many factors that have to be taken into consideration such as welding, 
corrosion, adhesive bonding, strength, formability, sound- and vibration properties and more. 
1.2 Purpose 
The purpose of this thesis is to lay a foundation for an upcoming GM project that concerns 
HybrixTM for automotive applications. The information basis should be wide and provide with 
valuable information for some of the main issues and problems with usage of HybrixTM in an 
automobile body. The thesis should also act as an information basis for several solutions and 
alternatives to problematic issues that a material shift of this type inherits. The thesis should 
 
2 
 
provide, along with the information basis, useful recommendations for future work in the 
upcoming GM project. 
1.3 Delimitation 
It is reasonable to limit the types of issues to be dealt with. Focus is directed towards joining 
techniques, corrosion and sound and vibration behavior. This means that some problematic 
areas are not covered by the investigation. 
Thorough economical calculations are not carried out, but some simple evaluations on 
material cost comparison will be. 
The thesis does not result in a manufactured physical component, it merely covers 
problematic issues that it inherits. 
Only two components are investigated more thoroughly for evaluating suitability of material 
shift to HybrixTM. 
Creating models using CAD and simulating using FEM is not performed.

CHAPTER 2 
2 FRAME OF REFERENCE 
CHAPTER INTRODUCTION 
The reference frame is a summary of the existing knowledge and former performed research 
on the subject. This chapter presents the theoretical reference frame that is necessary for the 
research. 
2.1 HybrixTM 
Information and present knowledge concerning HybrixTM is presented in this chapter. 
2.1.1 The design 
HybrixTM is a stainless steel sandwich material consisting of two outer sheets that are 
separated by steel pins and held together with a rubber based adhesive. The adhesive used is 
Bostik Elastosol M97. The production of a HybrixTM sheet is conducted as follows. Adhesive 
is applied onto two sheets of stainless steel. Steel fibers are spread, through flocking, over one 
of the sheets adhesive films passing through an electrical field forcing the steel fibers to stand 
upright. The second steel sheet is then placed upon the layer of steel fibers and the 
composition is cured during approximately 20 minutes and is then cooled and stored. The 
schematic design of HybrixTM is shown in Figure 1.

For better understanding of the production of HybrixTM see the schematic view in Figure 2. 
Here the different steps in the process of making a HybrixTM sheet are shown.

2.1.2 HybrixTM versions 
HybrixTM comes in several versions. For price, weight, configuration, technical and general 
information see Appendix A. 
2.1.3 Processing HybrixTM 
Lamera AB has created HybrixTM Processing Handbook which is found in Appendix A. 
2.1.4 Conducted test on deep drawing of HybrixTM 
A test on deep drawing of HybrixTM has been conducted . A deep drawing tool for a panel on 
a SAAB automobile was chosen, panel in Figure 3 below. 
 
Figure 3. Panel for testing of deep drawing [Courtesy of SAAB Automobile AB] 
This certain panel is deep drawn in one single step. The machine used was a single sided 
operated press machine with a capability of pressing with a force corresponding to 800 tons. 
The variables were draw force, blank holder force and friction between tool and HybrixTM 
sheet. The corresponding press force was set to 400 tons consequently. The corresponding 
blank holder force was varied between 50 and 150 tons. To vary the friction two different 
 
5 
 
plastic films was used. One of the plastic films used, referred to as “byggplast”, is the kind 
that is usually used in building construction, the other one is called Nitto. The HybrixTM sheet 
was pre cut according to a template that is used for deep drawing the panel, showed in Figure 
3, in regular solid steel sheet. The pre-cutting of the HybrixTM sheet is showed in Figure 4 
below. 
 
Figure 4. Pre cut HybrixTM sheet for deep drawing the specific panel [Courtesy of SAAB Automobile AB] 
The tool used deep draws two panels, one for the right and one for the left side of the 
automobile. The result from pressing with 400 tons, a corresponding blank holder force of 
150 tons with Nitto plastic film on both sides of the HybrixTM sheet can be seen in Figure 5 
below. 
 
Figure 5. Result from deep drawing the whole article [Courtesy of SAAB Automobile AB] 
The panels are obviously split and wrinkles are present in some areas, especially on the 
flanges. With the same parameters half of the article was deep drawn and the result is shown 
in Figure 6 below.

Figure 6. Result from deep drawing half of the article [Courtesy of SAAB Automobile AB] 
The conductors stated that the article could not be deep drawn to an acceptable result and 
therefore deep drew a small part of the article with just a strip of HybrixTM. This was 
conducted so that the spring-back of the deep drawn HybrixTM strip could be seen. The result 
from this is shown in Figure 7 below. 
 
Figure 7. Deep drawn HybrixTM strips [Courtesy of SAAB Automobile AB] 
One conclusion is that a tool designed for the specific material, HybrixTM, must be used to 
achieve good results. This is claimed to be possible to achieve if the deep drawing process 
could be simulated with a FE program. Simulations are not performed because data for a 
material behavior model was not available at the time of the deep drawing tests. 
2.1.5 Tests conducted on Hybrid Stainless Steel Assembly (HSSA) 
HSSA is the sandwich design which HybrixTM is based upon. HSSA material has been spot 
welded at the Cambridge University with bad results [1]. The HSSA in the test were, in 
difference from HybrixTM, bonded with a double-component epoxy.

2.1.6 Water absorption 
The open edges of the design of HybrixTM allow the core to absorb water. Tests were 
conducted at SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden year 2005. The tests showed that the 
Hybrix sheet absorbs water. 
2.2 Austenitic stainless steels 
Austenitic stainless steels are the most commonly used member of the stainless steel family 
[2]. The austenitic stainless steel inhibits a face-centered cubic crystal structure and it contains 
alloy elements such as nickel, manganese and nitrogen that act as austenitic stabilizers. What 
characterizes the steel is that it is non magnetic, low yield strength and high ductility. 
Moreover it has high work hardening rates. These desirable mechanical properties make 
austenitic stainless steels very popular for deep drawn products. The austenitic stainless steel 
grades are the most common of the stainless steel grades [2]. The austenitic stainless steels 
can be subjected to intergranular corrosion where chromium carbides are enriched in grain 
boundaries causing depletion of chromium adjacent to these carbides. The sensitization itself 
is caused by long time heat exposure or welding. The sensitization can be delayed or reduced 
by the use grades with lower carbon content (<0.03% C) or stabilized grades, such as AISI 
types 321 and 347 [2]. AISI types 304 and 316, the most common austenitic grades, are 
especially sensitive to chloride stress corrosion cracking, but many of the high-nickel and 
high-molybdenum grades are satisfactory with respect to chloride stress corrosion cracking in 
most engineering applications. 
According to [2] the appropriate grade selection can mean that stainless steel will perform for 
very long times with minimal corrosion, but an inadequate grade may corrode and perforate 
more rapidly than a plain carbon steel will fail by uniform corrosion. Furthermore [2] means 
that selection of the appropriate grade of stainless steel then is a balancing of the desire to 
minimize cost and the risk of corrosion damage in the predicted environment. 
2.3 Corrosion of stainless steels 
Stainless steel exhibits a certain passive layer developed on the surface which significantly 
reduces the corrosion rate of the steel. The passive layer is formed through a reaction between 
the steel and the ambient environment containing oxygen, such as water or air. The passive 
layer consists mostly of chromium and iron oxides. If damaged, the passive layer will be 
rebuilt fast through oxidization of the underlying metal, maintaining the corrosion resistance. 
Even though the passive layer protects the steel against corrosion, it only does that to a certain 
extent. The passive layer is dissolved at a certain rate, depending on the environment, causing 
consumption of the steel as the passive layer is rebuilt time after time.  
There are environments that cause permanent breakdown and hindering of the rebuilding 
process of the passive layer which leads to exposure of the unprotected surface causing high 
rate corrosion. Appearance, corrosion rate and nature of the corrosion attack depends on the 
environment. Therefore, corrosion of stainless steel is divided into several groups [3]. Focus 
in this study is on corrosion in aqueous solutions. The most common forms of corrosion in the 
automotive industry are uniform, galvanic, pitting, crevice and poultice [2]. These corrosions 
 
8 
 
principles are presented below with addition of stress corrosion cracking which especially 
austenitic stainless steel is subjected to, according to [2]. 
2.3.1 Uniform corrosion 
Uniform corrosion occurs when a large portion, or all, of the passive layer is damaged and 
destroyed. This leads to uniform removal of the unprotected metal due to corrosion reactions. 
Uniform corrosion of stainless steel is mainly caused by acids or by hot alkaline solutions. 
Higher chromium content is preferable to strengthen the uniform corrosion resistance of 
stainless steel since chromium is an essential ingredient in keeping the passive layer from 
decaying. Another important alloying element is nickel which helps reduce the corrosion rate 
of depassivated steel. In most environments high molybdenum content is favorable because of 
its enhancing of the passive layer. 
Uniform corrosion in a certain environment occurs at a constant rate if temperature and 
chemical composition is held at a constant level. The rate by which the metal is consumed is 
often measured in thickness loss per year and stainless steel is normally considered to be fully 
usable if the rate of the uniform corrosion does not exceed 0.1 mm per year [4]. 
2.3.2 Galvanic corrosion 
When two dissimilar materials are galvanically connected and immersed in a conductive 
liquid, an electrolyte, their corrosion performance might differ significantly when compared 
with the metals that are uncoupled [3]. The dissimilar metals in the electrolyte forms a 
galvanic cell where the less noble metal, the anode, is more severely attacked by corrosion 
than the more noble, the cathode, which is more or less relieved from corrosion attack. The 
corrosion occurs mostly close to the junction of the two metals. Factors that affect galvanic 
corrosion are essentially the difference in nobility of the two metals, the surface area ratio 
between the two metals and the conductivity of the solution. 
The “galvanic series” indicates the relative nobility of different conducting materials in a 
certain environment. When studying the galvanic series Figure 8  it can be sought out which 
materials are nobler than the other in the specific environment [2]. 
 
 
9 
 
 
Figure 8. Galvanic series, seawater at 25 ̊C 
A material with high corrosion potential is nobler than a material with low corrosion potential. 
A small difference in corrosion potential between two materials means that the driving force 
of the corrosion is low. One must have in mind that a change in the chemical composition or 
temperature can cause drastic change in the difference of the corrosion potential. Thus, 
quantitative predictions of the extent of the galvanic attack based on a galvanic series are not 
recommended. 
Stainless steels that stay passive are very often more noble than other construction materials 
therefore saving the stainless steels. But this also means that parts of a construction made out 
of common construction materials such as galvanized steel, mild steel and copper connected 
to stainless steel will in some extent be severely attacked by galvanic corrosion. This means 
that extra consideration is needed when constructing with mixed materials. 
To help reducing the galvanic corrosion attack of a construction of two dissimilar materials 
isolation of the two materials is preferred. This can be achieved through using insulated 
flanges for example. But this is not a definitive solution because the flange can be attacked by 
crevice corrosion in presence of chloride solutions instead. Another way of reducing the 
galvanic attack is to keep the anode to cathode area ratio large. Coating or painting of the 
anode in the galvanic is also to be avoided because of the severe attacks that may occur on 
small, unprotected areas caused by damage in the coating [3]. On the other hand painting or 
coating of the cathode is preferable due to the reduced risk of galvanic attack. 
The conductivity of the solution affects the galvanic attack as well. The less conductive the 
solution is the lower is the rate of the galvanic attack. On the other hand, when conductivity is 
low the attacks seem to be very concentrated in the area adjacent to the contact area of the two 
metals. 
 
10 
 
Electrochemical protection can be used to protect metal from galvanic attacks. Protection of 
the cathode is achieved by connecting a less noble metal to the cathode and thus creating a 
sacrifice anode. The anode is consumed by galvanic attacks and the cathode is essentially 
protected from corrosion. Protection of the cathode can also be achieved by connecting it to 
the negative pole of an external source of direct current. Protection of the cathode is only 
applicable to a certain extent. In some environments cathode protection can cause breakdown 
of the passive layer which then leads to active corrosion of the steel surface. 
Anodic protection also may be achieved [3]. 
2.3.3 Localized corrosion 
In opposite to uniform corrosion where all, or a large section, of the passive layer is 
destroyed, localized corrosion inhibits passive layer breakdown locally whilst the rest of the 
passive layer remains intact. There are several forms of localized corrosion and, in practice, 
these are a more frequent source of failure than that of uniform corrosion. 
Pitting is one kind of localized corrosion. It is characterized by attacks at small discrete areas. 
The pits may look small on the outside but they often have a larger cross section area deeper 
inside the metal. Pitting mainly occurs in neutral or acid solutions containing chloride. This 
type of corrosion often occurs around impurities in the metal surface. Impurities such as 
inclusions, crevices caused by grinding, deposits formed by slag and more are common 
sources. Breakdown of the passive layer is caused by chloride ions which generates a galvanic 
cell where the unprotected metal acts as anode and the untouched passive areas around acts as 
cathode. This means that pitting often inhibits fast corrosion rates due to the unfavorable 
surface area ratio between anode and cathode. As the passive layer is dissolved in the pit, the 
freed metal ions attract chloride ions to even out the pH. This means that the environment in 
the pit gets more and more aggressive, reducing the chance of rebuilding of the passive layer, 
and therefore the corrosion rate accelerates. Due to the small entry hole of the pit they often 
remain undiscovered until a leak in the construction in sprung. 
Another form of localized corrosion is crevice corrosion. This type also occurs in neutral and 
acid solutions containing chlorides. The attacks are more often initiated in crevices than on 
unshielded surface. Narrow crevices inhibit large capillary forces which make it almost 
impossible to avoid penetration of liquid. A common area for crevice corrosion is piping 
containing flowing liquid where pipes are connected to one another via bolted flanges. The 
liquid in the narrow crevice area is stagnant and the oxygen and other oxidants are consumed 
to maintain the passive layer. Chlorides then break down the passive layer in the crevice as 
the amount of oxidants decreases. In accordance with pitting a galvanic cell is formed with 
the bare metal in the crevice acting as anode and the untouched passive areas acts as cathode. 
Chloride concentration increases as the metal ions are freed in the crevice and the corrosion 
process is accelerating as the oxidants are not likely to penetrate the crevice and rebuild the 
passive layer. 
 
11 
 
The risk of pitting and crevice corrosion increases with low pH, high chloride concentrations, 
high temperature and stagnant fluids. These types of corrosion only occur with a fully 
developed passive layer and thus in solutions sufficiently oxidizing [3]. 
2.3.4 Poultice corrosion 
Poultice corrosion is a form of crevice corrosion which is formed under deposits of debris that 
can be formed on the underside of the fenders [2]. The deposits contain contaminants such as 
road salts which can initiate the corrosion attack. 
2.3.5 Chloride stress corrosion cracking (SCC) 
This type of corrosion is caused by static tensile stress in a material together with a corrosive 
medium containing chloride, such as salt water. As mentioned above, this type of corrosion is 
relatively common with austenitic stainless steel grades such as AISI 304 and 316. The actual 
tensile stress has to exceed a certain critical point before stress corrosion cracking can be 
initiated. The most common sources to the tensile stress is residual stresses caused by cold 
work or welding and externally applied mechanical stresses [4].  
The SCC process is divided into the initiation and the propagation phase [4]. The initiation 
phase is the process that precedes cracking. The propagation phase is the process of the crack 
propagating through the metal, either inter- or trans crystalline. Intergranular crack 
propagation means that the crack propagates between the grains and transgranular means that 
the crack propagates through the grains. 
2.4 Resistance welding 
Welding can be divided into two main branches, pressure and fusion welding [5]. Further 
branching can be viewed in Figure 9 where several resistance welding methods are shown. 
 
Figure 9. The branches of welding 
 
12 
 
Resistance welding is one of the oldest welding methods. The heat input originates from the 
electric heating when the current passes the resistance in the contact area between two metal 
sheets. The metal melts locally in the contact area created by a externally added force and the 
two sheets bond via a weld. Resistance welding is often fast, efficient and environmentally 
friendly [5]. No material is added but the investment cost is often high and the area of use is 
often narrow. 
2.4.1 Resistance spot welding 
Resistance spot welding is the most common joining technique in the automotive industry [5]. 
An automobile body usually contains between 4000 and 7000 spot welds. To easier 
understand the basics of spot welding Figure 10 shows a schematic view of two metal sheets 
being spot welded. The bodies on each side of the work piece are the electrodes and between 
the two metal sheets an elliptical area is shown, this is the nugget.  
 
Figure 10. A schematic view of a spot weld being formed 
The metal sheets are placed between the electrodes which are pressed together with the force 
F where the weld is desired to be placed. Heat, Q, is developed between the electrodes when a 
current is running through the circuit. The amount heat depends on the weld current, IW, and 
the resistance, R. Heat amount is described in equation 1.

A resistance spot weld operation can be made as described here [6]. During the initiation time 
T1, see Figure 11, the force is added to desired amount. The weld current is then added during 
weld time T. The work piece is cooled during holding time T2 and thereafter the force is 
relieved and the spot weld is done. 
 
13 
 
 
Figure 11. Schematic view over a resistance spot weld process 
The described operation is valid for a general spot weld. The process can be configured 
differently, for example a pre pulse can be added, which means that a specific current is sent 
through the sheets for a specific amount of time. Between the pre pulse and the main pulse 
there is a pause time. The electrodes must be made from material with low electric 
conductance and good heat transfer ability so that the heat can be transferred away from the 
outer contact areas. If these electrode criteria are not fulfilled the outer contact area can be 
brought to melting temperature thus causing deformation and immense electrode wear and in 
worst case causing the electrode and the work piece being welded together [6]. 
 Special operations have been developed at SAAB Automobile for the case when the general 
process does not work properly for some reasons. This can include one or more pre pulses that 
prepare the sample before the main. 
The electrodes are the most important tools when spot welding [6]. Their functions are to 
transfer both the contact force and the weld current. A second level function is to divert 
surplus heat from the spot weld. In accordance with equation 1 and 2 along with Figure 10 
heat is developed in the contact between electrode and metal sheet, within the metal sheet and 
between the metal sheets. For the nugget to be formed a requirement has to be fulfilled, that is 
the heat between the metal sheets has to be greater than the heat in the contact between the 
electrode and the metal sheet. This means that r1 has to be lower than r3. This is obtained by 
keeping a good surface finish on both the metal sheet and the electrode contact area [6].  
The electrodes are subjected to wear and therefore required to be replaced fairly easy. There 
are two types of replaceable electrode ends, the indirectly cooled electrode cap or the directly 
cooled electrode tip [6]. The advantage of the directly cooled electrode tip is that it inherits a 
greater cooling ability. The advantage of the indirectly cooled electrode cap is that it can be 
replaced without turning off the cooling water flow. The type used in the production lines at 
SAAB Automobile AB is the indirectly cooled electrode cap. 
 
14 
 
SAAB Automobile AB follows SS-ISO 5821 which states that “This International Standard 
lays down the dimensions and tolerances of resistance spot welding electrode caps, where a 
female taper (see ISO 10891 is used to fix the cap to an electrode adaptor (see ISO 5183))”. 
The specific type that is used in production at SAAB Automobile AB is Type B, see Figure 
12. 
 
Figure 12. Electrode cap, Type B, according to SS-ISO 5821 
The parameters seen in Figure 12 are set according to Table 1.

2.4.2 Spot welding of austenitic stainless steels 
There are generally no problems involving spot welding of austenitic stainless steels [6]. Spot 
welding of austenitic stainless steel to itself is stated to have excellent weldability. The 
weldability is claimed to be as good as for most unalloyed steels. An advantage is that the 
distance between the spots can be reduced compared to unalloyed steels due to the relatively 
lower electrical conductivity of the austenitic stainless steels. This means that the troublesome 
branch currents are avoided. Another disadvantage of stainless steel is that it has low heat 
conductivity [6]. This means that it may be favorable to imply a more accurate setup of the 
weld current compared to unalloyed steels. The reason for setting up the weld current more 
accurate is that overheating may occur in the central region of the spot weld. This can lead to 
spatter both between the sheets and in the contact between electrode cap and sheet and also 
pores, too large weld nugget and in some cases even cracks. Due to the lower heat 
conductivity of the austenitic stainless steel it is also important to raise the weld force in 
comparison with spot welding of unalloyed steels.  
 
15 
 
Austenitic stainless steels with a composition of 18 % Cr and 8 % Ni that is resistance welded 
to itself is recommended by [6] to be so with electrodes of material A 3/1 according to SS-
ISO 5182. 
2.4.3 Spot welding of galvanized steel 
Spot welding of galvanized steel inhibits an accumulation of a zinc layer on the electrode cap 
which leads to reduced life of the cap, demanding shorter intervals of cap dressing [6]. In 
comparison to spot welding of unalloyed steels it is important to raise the weld current due to 
the lower contact resistance of the zinc layer. In order to obtain a good spot weld the zinc 
layer needs to be pushed away, why the weld force and current must be raised. Naturally this 
leads to further reduction of the electrode cap life time. Another property that spot welding of 
galvanized steel inhibits is that the weld time must be prolonged in order to get rid of the zinc 
layer in the contacts. The weld time can in the case of spot welding heat galvanized steel be 
raised to as much as 25 to 50 % [6]. 
2.4.4 Spot welding with mixed materials 
The weldability for the resistance welding of austenitic stainless steel (composition 18 % Cr 
and 8 % Ni) to heat galvanized steel is poor [6]. It is also stated that the electrode will have to 
be dressed relatively often. The recommended electrode material for this combination is A 2/2 
pursuant to SS-ISO 5182. 
The fusion zone in a spot weld between austenitic stainless steel and galvanized low carbon 
steel is bound to be asymmetrically displaced according to [7]. The reason for this is the lower 
electrical resistance and higher thermal conductivity of galvanized steel compared to 
austenitic stainless steel. The fusion zone will be displaced towards the austenitic stainless 
steel sheet. 
2.4.5 Spot welding with a Mid Frequency DC inverter 
At SAAB Automobile AB there are currently two different spot welding systems in use. One 
system is governed by an effective power source called Mid Frequency Direct Current 
(MFDC) inverter. This is the most effective source due to the fast response that contributes to 
a far more controlled and stable process compared to earlier systems [8]. It enables the spot 
weld process to compensate for disturbances in a very fast and effective way. The MFDC 
system can adjust the current every 1 ms, which is between 10 and 20 times faster than a 
conventional AC system. A schematic design of the MFDC inverter is shown in Figure 13. 
 
16 
 
 
Figure 13. Schematic overview of MFDC inverter 
The inverter is connected to the 3 phase, 400 V line, see diagram A in Figure 13. The current 
is standardized with help of 6 diodes which results in a voltage of about 570 V with a ripple 
frequency of 300 Hz, see diagram B in Figure 13. The direct current is hacked up into a 1000 
Hz with help of 4 thyristor bridges which are activated two by two diagonally. This setup of 
thyristors is called IGBT, Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor [8]. This generates a period which 
consists of one part positive and one part negative voltage, see diagram C in Figure 13. The 
square wave voltage is transformed to between 5 and 14 Volts in the 1000 Hz transformer. In 
the second winding of the transformer the current is once again standardized. The current is 
thereby set through activating the thyristor bridges for various length of time. 
Note that the diagrams in Figure 13 are not exact but just schematic overviews that help 
explain the character of the voltage. 
2.4.6 Mechanical testing of spot welds 
Spot welds are tested through shear pull tests at SAAB Automobile AB. The spot weld 
sample is fixated in the pull test machine that pulls the sample apart with a constant speed. A 
simplified view of the shear pull test is seen in Figure 14. 
 
Figure 14. Schematic overview of principle for shear pull test 
The arrows in Figure 14 represent the mechanically applied force. When the shear pull test is 
done the sample can be studied. There are mainly two types of ruptures of which one is 
approved. The first type is where the fracture runs through the weld, which is not approved. 
The second type is where the fracture runs solely through the bulk material, which is 
approved. 
 
17 
 
The test results are suitably presented in a force-strain diagram and a table that shows 
maximum force for the tested samples.  
2.4.7 Evaluation of spot weld cross section 
A cross section examination is needed to fully evaluate the quality of a spot weld. A 
simplified, schematic view of a spot weld cross section is showed in Figure 15. 
 
Figure 15. Schematic view of a spot weld cross section 
In Figure 15 one can study the simplified view of a cross section of a spot weld between two 
metal sheets. The gray ellipses mark out the areas allowed to exhibit cracks. How load is 
applied to the weld is affecting the exact areas where cracks are not approved. The load can 
for example be applied as in Figure 16. 
 
Figure 16. Zones that are demanded to be crack free for specific load 
 
 Some surface cracking in the centre of the electrode indentions are allowed thus it has been 
shown that it does not affect the overall strength of the spot weld. Other common flaws in a 
spot weld are lack of fusion and pores. Lack of fusion is fairly easy to detect because it looks 
just like the sheets in the weld are separated, see Figure 17. 
 
18 
 
 
Figure 17. Spot weld cross section with flaws 
In Figure 17 there is also a pore which in fact is a gas inclusion. 
2.5 Fastening systems suitable for the automotive industry 
There are many fastening systems, besides spot welding, that are suitable for the automotive 
industry, here some are presented. 
2.5.1 Pop rivets 
A rivet is used to form a fixed connection between two or more components that are made of 
either similar or dissimilar materials [9]. There are several types of rivets and one of those is 
the tubular type which the pop rivet belongs to. Riveting has largely been exchanged for the 
benefit of welding. There are mainly three types of pop rivets. The three types are based upon 
the same principle and they are called hollow, long-brake mandrel, short-brake and mandrel 
type, Figure 18 shows the last two types. 
 
Figure 18. Long- and short-brake mandrel type pop rivets 
 
19 
 
The right side of Figure 18 shows the unused pop rivet (long-brake at the top and short-brake 
at the bottom) and the left side shows the expanded result of the pop rivet joint. The pop rivets 
are expanded by a drift. 
2.5.2 Huck fasteners  
The Huck fastener falls between the categories of rivet and bolt [10]. The clamp force that is 
applied during fixing gives a predictable and uniform preload. The Huck fastener combines 
the high shear resistance of the rivet and the tensile resistance of the bolt. Several different 
types of Huck fasteners are shown in Figure 19. 
 
Figure 19. Several types of Huck fasteners [Courtesy of Aerobolt Pty Ltd] 
The different Huck fasteners are designed individually, giving them different properties [11] 
2.5.3 Clinching 
Pressurized clinching is a mechanical process to join layered material, like sheets steel [9]. 
The process combines cold upsetting, cutting and penetration in a single continuous operation 
without applying any additional heat. Two sheets with thicknesses of 3 mm each can be 
joined together via pressurized clinching [9]. The tooling consists of a punch and a 
shearing/forming die [10]. 
A method called tox clinching [9] which is practically the same as Eckold clinching [10] is 
somewhat similar to pressurized clinching. These two methods have an advantage on 
pressurized clinching because they exclude the cutting process [9]. A cross section view over 
an Eckold clinch is shown in Figure 20. 
 
Figure 20. Eckold clinch, cross section view [Courtesy of Eckold GmbH & Co. KG] 
The clinch seen in Figure 20 is a joint with dissimilar materials, aluminum and steel. The 
Eckold clinch can successfully be combined with adhesive to avoid galvanic corrosion and 
increase the holding strength, according Eckold GmbH & Co. KG (e-mail, February 12th 
2009). 
 
20 
 
 
Figure 21. Eckold clinch with adhesive, cross section view [Courtesy of Eckold GmbH & Co. KG] 
The combination of Eckold clinching and adhesive has been successfully employed in the 
Daimler Chrysler S-class where aluminum components have been joined to steel components 
in the rear part of the automobile, see Figure 22. 
 
Figure 22. Clinching spots in Daimler Chrysler S-Class [Courtesy of Eckold GmbH & Co. KG] 
In Figure 22 it can be seen where the aluminum components have been attached in the rear of 
the S-Class. The aluminium components have been clinched with adhesive, clinch bonded. 
The clinch will fixate the body whilst the adhesive cures. The S-Class contains of over 650 
clinch spots per automobile. Clinch bonding has also been used in Maybach.  
2.5.4 Projection weld studs 
Projection stud welding is widely used, including the automotive industry [12]. Stud-welding 
is the general name for attachment of stud or fastener by welding. The main objective of a 
weld stud within the automotive industry is to provide attachment possibility for components 
or brackets. The stud-welding process requires no holes and is done without shielding gas or 
filler material. As the name implies the process inherits a projection weld, commonly arc 
welding. A schematic view of a general projection weld stud is shown in Figure 23. 
 
21 
 
 
Figure 23. Projection weld stud 
Sizes that are used are commonly in the area of 10-30 mm with M6 thread. Figure 24 shows 
how a weld stud on a sheet of steel may appear. 
 
Figure 24. Schematic view, weld stud attached to a piece of steel sheet 
Thorough test on projection weld studs on sandwich material has been conducted at SAAB 
Automobile AB. Old SAAB Automobile AB guidelines say that the total thickness of the face 
sheets on sandwich material must exceed 0.8-0.9 mm for projection welding to be possible. 
2.5.5 Adhesive bonding 
Adhesives are used to create a permanent, rigid bond between metallic or non metallic 
material [9]. The bonding forces are both physical and chemical on molecular level. 
Adhesives come in either single- or double-component design. 
The attractive ability of adhesives is to be able to bond a whole surface rather than a few 
points [10]. According to Technical Specialist in BIW Joining Technologies at Volvo Car 
Corporation, Gothenburg, Sweden (lecture, May 8th 2007) the different types of adhesives 
used in automobile manufacturing are the following, see Table 2.

Adhesive joining has become a standard joining method within the automotive industry [9]. 
A common denominator for adhesives is that they are most suitable for shear loads and thus 
adhesive joints should be designed in a way that mainly implies shears loads [9]. 
2.5.6 Adhesive tape bonding 
There are several types of tapes [13]. Double adhesive tapes are a special type of tape that 
comes with or without backing material. The company 3MTM have marketed two special types 
of double adhesive tapes without backing material, called VHBTM (Very High BondTM) and 
SBTTM (Structural Bonding TapeTM). 
The VHBTM tape is an acrylic foam tape that exhibits a visco elastic behavior [14]. The 
VHBTM tape has very high strength regarding both static and dynamic loads. The visco elastic 
behavior of the VHBTM tape makes it a good shock absorber and it also distributes the loads 
evenly along the joint. The VHBTM tape can join many different material combinations. The 
VHBTM tape has proven to withstand harsh conditions and seems to avoid being affected at all 
by fatigue, vibrations, heat, cold, temperature changes, moisture, dissolving agents and UV 
light [14]. 
The SBTTM exhibits the strength of an epoxy adhesive and the convenience of the VHBTM 
tape [14]. The uncured STBTM gives the same strength as the VHBTM tape and when heat 
cured ten times the strength of the VHBTM tape [13]. The SBTTM is used in many industries, 
among those, the automotive industry. The SBTTM can replace liquid adhesives, bolts, rivets, 
spot welds and more. 
2.6 Noise, vibration and harshness (NVH) 
In an automobile the main source of noise is the power-train [10]. The noise must be 
prevented from transmitting into the driver and passenger compartment even though there are 
no legal requirements for interior noise levels [9]. 
 
23 
 
There are initially two characteristics that are interesting for determining the NVH properties 
of a material concerning automotive body applications. These are transmission loss (TL) and 
loss factor. The former describes the loss of sound when it is acoustically transmitted through 
a material. The latter in short describes the damping constant of the material. 
To cope with sound and vibration transmission in the automobile body certain measures can 
be taken. Deadeners with different thicknesses and weight per unit area are mounted to the 
desired article. Deadeners are mats of soft dampening material. For example, a panel made of 
a light material is more easily exited than a heavier one. This is corrected by adding deadeners 
to the lightweight panel, thus obtaining a higher TL (due to added weight) and a higher loss 
factor (due to visco elastic behavior of the deadener). 
2.6.1 NVH tests at SAAB Automobile AB 
Several tests regarding NVH properties of materials and components can be carried out in the 
NVH laboratory at SAAB Automobile AB. Initially, when investigating a new material it is 
desired to determine the TL and loss factor. TL can be determined by transmitting sound at 
specific frequencies towards a square sheet of the material. The sound is transmitted in a 
reverberation room and is measured in the echo free room on the other side of the sheet of 
material. The test rig is configured so that sound only can be transmitted via the square sheet 
of the material. Measurements are made at many different frequencies and the result is 
presented as TL per one-third octave band. 
The loss factor is determined by conducting an Oberst beam test where a bar of the material to 
be tested is excited and the vibration dampening of the material is measured. 
2.7 Automobile bodies 
The automobile bodies that are manufactured at SAAB Automobile AB are of the specific 
type unibody. Figure 25 shows a so called body-in-white (BIW) from Opel Insignia. 
 
24 
 
 
Figure 25.  Opel Insignia BIW [Courtesy of SAAB Automobile AB] 
The unibody structure is built up with sheet metal of different thicknesses that are formed into 
desired shapes or components that all contribute to the load bearing body [15]. The forming 
processes mainly consist of deep drawing and roll forming. All the different components are 
joined together in a very integrated structure. According to Technical Specialist in BIW 
Joining Technologies at Volvo Car Corporation, Gothenburg, Sweden (lecture, May 8th 2007) 
the joining techniques that are used in automobile manufacturing are the following, see Table 
3.

At SAAB Automobile AB, many weld junctions are sealed with a PVC substance to ensure 
full sealing from the outside environment to help avoid corrosion problems. 
The joints between all the different components in the unibody consist of two or three sheets 
in either overlap joints or T joints, see Figure 26. 
 
Figure 26. Overlap and T joints with two or three sheets, schematic view 
The joints may have appeared in different combinations but Figure 26 shows the principle of 
which these are configured. 
2.7.1 Body materials and corrosion protection 
The most commonly used material in automobile bodies is sheet steel of various grades [9]. 
But there are alternatives, for example aluminum and plastics. Steel is often protected through 
cathode protection [10]. This method involves a coating of the steel with for example zinc 
which is more negative in the electro-chemical series than the steel thus sacrificing itself to 
the benefit of the steel. Aside the sacrificial protections there are more protecting methods to 
be used. 
Besides choosing the right materials and protective coatings design measures have to be taken 
to avoid different corrosion types [9]. To avoid galvanic corrosion between dissimilar 
materials electrical insulation has to be applied. 
2.7.2 Coating the automobile body 
The automobile body is coated in five steps [9]. The coat layers are shown in Figure 27. 
 
27 
 
 
Figure 27. Paint coat layers 
The unpainted product is dipped in a bath of electrophoretic emulsion and electric direct 
current is passed through both the product and the emulsion which forms the electrodes [16]. 
The paint particles that are in contact with the corrosion adhere to it and create an electrically 
insulating layer. When the insulating layer is built up no more paint adhere to the product and 
it is then baked in an oven.

CHAPTER 3 
3 METHOD 
CHAPTER INTRODUCTION 
In this chapter the working process is described. This process is called method and its purpose 
is to help the researcher to reach the goals for the project. 
3.1 Spot weld tests 
The spot weld tests are carried out to get an initial indication of the weldability of HybrixTM, 
and combinations of HybrixTM and other material. It is of utmost importance that HybrixTM 
can be joined to galvanized steel and spot welding is the most common joining method in the 
automotive industry. 
3.1.1 Configuration 
The spot weld tests are carried out in the school facilities at SAAB Automobile AB. Initially 
three sample groups are founded, and the goal is to produce ten weld samples of each group to 
process further. The matrix in Table 5 shows the three sample groups and the amount of 
desired, approved weld samples. 
Table 5. Weld sample groups

GS is galvanized steel with the sheet thickness 0.7 mm and yield stress of approximately 200 
MPa. The HybrixTM version used in this test is HybrixTM Light 102. The GS-GS weld sample 
group acts as a reference group to compare the other groups with. 
The weld jig that is used demands certain dimensions on the sample pieces. Both the 
HybrixTM sheet and the GS sheet are cut into shape using shearing. Approximately 140 pieces 
of each sheet type is sheared into pieces with the specified dimension 125x40 mm. An 
excessive amount of sample pieces are desired to be able to trim the welding process 
parameters for each weld sample group.  
The power source used in this test is the same as the ones used in the production lines for 
SAAB 9-3, Cadillac BLS and Cadillac BLS Wagon. The power source inherits inverter DC 
technology with a mid frequency of 1000 Hz. The equipment is of the brand Matuschek and 
the specific model of the power source is AutoSpatz M300-600.  
Welding is done by a robot, ABB IRB6400, the same robot used in the production line for the 
above mentioned automobiles. The electrode cap that is used is Type B in accordance with 
international standard SS-ISO 5821. The electrode dimensions are defined in Figure 12. 
Dimensions and material specifications for the electrode cap are found in Table 6 below.

Tests begin with welding of GS to GS. Parameters are set to suitable values for the specific 
material combination. Parameters that can be varied are force [N], current [kA] and time [ms]. 
During parameter trimming every spot weld sample is torn apart to study the nugget. When 
the nugget size is at least 5 mm for GS to GS without any other defect like cracks and spatter, 
the 10 samples for further investigation can be created. For the combinations HybrixTM to 
HybrixTM and GS to HybrixTM the nugget size demand cannot be set to a specific value due to 
lack of experience of welding these material combinations. The spot welds are torn apart for 
evaluation of nugget size. When parameters are trimmed in for the last two material 
combinations, 10 samples of each group are created. All samples are marked with numbers 
from 1 to 10 to easily track parameter settings. Parameter settings and depending values will 
be saved in an Excel sheet for each sample group. The weld test cell is shown in Figure 28 
below. 
 
Figure 28. Robot weld cell 
In the left part of Figure 28 the weld tool and jig can be seen. A voltage meter is used to 
verify the voltage load, it can be seen in the left part of Figure 28. The IRB6400 robot can be 
seen in the right part of Figure 28, where the electrode cap forming module also can be seen.

3.2  Material tests 
Some material properties will be studied by performing certain tests and evaluation regarding 
approval will be conducted. 
3.2.1 Pull tests 
Out of the 10 weld samples of each sample group, 9 will be subjected to a shear pull test. This 
test is conducted to determine if the spot welds are approved according to company rules. The 
shear pull tests are also conducted to determine whether the HybrixTM sheets inherit 
conformity regarding material properties over a larger area of the sheet. Results are also 
compared to reference samples of GS spot welded to GS. The results are presented in 
diagrams where the horizontal and vertical axis will show linear strain and force respectively. 
Tables that show maximum force for each sample in each sample group are created to make 
way for comparison. The samples are investigated after the pull tests are conducted, this is to 
determine whether they are approved according to company requirements. 
3.2.2 Spot weld cross section analysis 
It is important that the quality of the welds can be determined, therefore spot welds of 
HybrixTM to HybrixTM and HybrixTM to GS will be cut in half so that the cross section can be 
studied. The two spot weld samples are split with help of a fine saw. The samples are molded 
with bakelite into a pellet. The samples are grinded little by little with finer grades of sand 
paper and are finally polished in two steps where the last step inherits a polish with 3 ηm 
sized granules. The samples are studied in different microscopes where the inside of the weld 
is exposed. 
3.2.3 Adhesive and steel fiber structure analysis 
To be able to draw certain conclusions regarding material and weld tests it is of utmost 
importance that the inside of the HybrixTM sheet is studied. The HybrixTM Light 102 version 
will be torn apart and the adhesive and steel fiber structure will be studied with microscope. 
The expected structure is the one presented in Figure 1. 
3.3 Components manufactured in HybrixTM – identification of 
problems and their solutions 
To be able to identify problems that need to be resolved before implementing HybrixTM in an 
Automobile body two body components are investigated. Description of the components, 
clarification of how they are manufactured and the demands on properties lies as a base for 
the problem identification process. 
Sought information is collected from experts at SAAB Automobile AB and compiled in 
chapter 4.3 and 4.4. 
The two components are chosen on the basis of HybrixTM main advantageous properties, light 
weight, stiffness and NVH behavior. The problematic issues concerning shifting material to 
HybrixTM on the two components will be specific and concrete but will also in some extent 
represent general issues regarding HybrixTM implementation in an automobile body. 
 
31 
 
Possible problematic issues are found through literature study and input from experts at 
SAAB Automobile AB. 
Plausible solutions are presented for the specific problematic issues and issues concerning 
implementation of these solutions are discussed in chapter 6.

CHAPTER 4 
4 ANALYSIS AND RESULT 
CHAPTER INTRODUCTION 
In the analysis chapter the data compiled in the empirical research that is described in the 
method chapter is compared to the existing theory presented in the frame of reference chapter.   
4.1 Spot weld tests 
The results of the weld test varied a lot. All of the tests could not be completed in a desired 
way. The results for the individual sample groups are presented in the following sub chapters 
along with analysis. 
4.1.1 Spotwelding of GS to GS 
As expected, the GS to GS weld tests went really well, mostly due long experience of 
resistance welding of galvanized steel sheets within the automobile industry. Thanks to expert 
help, the parameters for this sample group were set easily and fast. The current was set to 10.9 
kA, the time was set to 240 ms and the force was set to 2500 N. The nugget size reached 6 
mm in diameter with these settings, without severe spatter or other visible defects, which was 
approved by Tage. In Table 7 below the measured values of these variables are shown along 
with the weld number and comment. 
Table 7. Measured values on each sample in the specific sample group 
 
Although parameters were set to best possible, two of the samples were subjected to spatter or 
burning. The spatter was not severe but the two samples were removed from the sample lot. 
Parameters were measured with a separate voltage meter to verify and the difference between 
the values was ignorable.

4.1.2 Spotwelding of HybrixTM to HybrixTM 
This sample group was trickier to set up accurately. The samples tended to reach better results 
if the time was held short and the current high. After some trimming of the settings an 
accepted nugget size was achieved. The current was set to 10 kA, the force was set to 2900 N 
and the time was set to 200 ms. The values measured during weld operation are shown in 
Table 8 below.

After setting the parameters as good as possible welding of samples for further tests was 
started. As can be seen in Table 8 there were five samples that were subjected to spatter, or 
burning. These were removed although the spatter was not that severe. This was to get as 
good sample as possible to move forward with. The fact that one third of the weld samples 
were subjected to spatter implies that the design is somewhat inhomogeneous. Parameters 
were measured with a separate voltage meter to verify and the difference between the values 
was ignorable. In Figure 29 below it can be seen that the nugget is of an acceptable size, 
around 5 mm. The yellow arrows points at the weld with the above set variables. 
 
34 
 
 
Figure 29. Torn up HybrixTM to HybrixTM sample showing nugget size 
The faces that are marked with x is the sides facing inward and vice versa with the faces 
marked with y. It can be seen that the face sheets are bulging both inwards and outwards in 
reference to the weld. The bulging causes irregularities in the contact between electrode cap 
and sheet which shows in Figure 29, section Y1 where the arrow points. The face sheets are 
somewhat burned there which shows as dark and discolored area. The bulging is a problem 
that is caused by carburized adhesive. The gas that is formed cannot evacuate sufficiently. 
The problem was relieved when placing the spot weld closer to the edge of the sheet. In that 
way the gases in some cases could evacuate via the open edge of the sheet. Thus, evacuating 
gases caused delaminating forces at the evacuation point in some cases, see Figure 30. 
 
35 
 
 
Figure 30. Delaminated HybrixTM sheet at spot weld 
The delaminating has occurred between the outer face sheet and the core. Also visible in 
Figure 30 is the gap created between the two HybrixTM sheets caused by bulging of the face 
sheets. The gap seen in Figure 30 is almost 1.5 mm wide. The bulge can be formed on the 
outside, inside or on both sides on each HybrixTM sheet respectively. 
The reason for spatter on five of the samples seems to be that the bulge grew outwards against 
the electrode and creating another contact at the edge of the electrode. 
4.1.3 Spotwelding of HybrixTM to GS 
This sample group turned out to be very difficult to manage, as expected. No approved 
samples could be produced at all. The parameters were varied and it seemed impossible with 
only one pulse. A pre pulse that heated up the material prior to the main pulse was set up. This 
was to lower the contact resistance between electrodes and sample so that spatter might be 
avoided and approved nugget size could be achieved. All parameters were varied on both the 
main and the pre pulse but a good result was not achieved. In all attempts to produce 
approved samples of this configuration stainless steel from the HybrixTM sheet got welded to 
the electrode. This meant that forming of the electrode cap had to be executed in between 
every test with different parameter setting. In Figure 31 the damaged electrode cap is shown. 
 
Figure 31. Damaged electrode cap 
Two cases of this type of electrode damage occurred, one where both face plates of the 
HybrixTM sheet got welded to the electrode and another where only the outer face sheet got 
welded to the electrode. In Figure 32 a torn up sample is shown. To the left in the figure the 
GS sheets inside is shown and to the right the outside of the HybrixTM sheet is shown. 
 
36 
 
 
 Figure 32. Torn up sample of GS welded to HybrixTM 
The nugget seen in Figure 32 to the left is about the average size that could be obtained during 
test period. The circle in the right part of Figure 32 marks out an area where both face sheets 
of the HybrixTM sheet has been welded to the electrode cap, this can be understood by 
comparing the left and the right side of the figure. Another common phenomenon was that 
cracks in the HybrixTM sheet occurred around the spot weld, this can be seen in Figure 33. 
 
Figure 33. Another torn up sample of GS welded to HybrixTM 
The cracks are visible around the weld in the right part of Figure 33. Within the marked area 
in the left part of Figure 33 only one face sheet of the HybrixTM has been welded to the GS 
sheet and if compared with the right part it can be understood that some portions 
corresponding to that area has been welded to the electrode cap. The nugget in Figure 33 is 
about the largest size that could be obtained even though it is not large enough. 
 
37 
 
As mentioned in the beginning of this sub chapter all samples produced caused damage to the 
electrode cap, thus not approved. Substandard size of nuggets comes in second hand and were 
all rejected. 
4.2 Material tests 
All material tests could be conducted without problems and the results are presented along 
with analysis in the following sub chapters. 
4.2.1 Pull tests 
All samples in the two sample groups were approved due to appropriate rupture. All samples 
showed plug rupture and in Figure 34 a typical plug rupture is shown. 
 
 
Figure 34. Plug rupture of sample no. 8 in sample group HybrixTM to HybrixTM 
Pictures of all samples can be viewed in Appendix E. The plug in Figure 34 measures 5 mm 
and that is an acceptable plug. The plugs on the reference group, GS to GS, measured around 
7 mm. 
Ignore numbers drawn on samples in Figure E 1 to Figure E 4 in Appendix E. 
The reference samples that solely contained GS welded to GS behaved in an expected, 
conform way. Maximum load for all of the 9 samples is shown in

Diagrams containing a curve for each test sample showing load on the vertical axis and strain 
on the horizontal axis are found in Appendix D. 
The diagrams for sample group HybrixTM to HybrixTM, shown in Appendix D, show that they 
were somewhat conform in their strain behavior. In comparison to sample group GS to GS it 
 
39 
 
is clear that the ability to bare load when plasticity occurs is much lower. The reason for this 
seems to be that the GS to GS sample group is subjected to strain hardening to a great extent 
when the HybrixTM to HybrixTM sample group is not. 
Obviously pull test of the sample group HybrixTM to GS could not be conducted due to failure 
to produce approved samples. 
4.2.2 Spot weld cross section analysis 
Cross section analysis showed that both samples inherited flaws that in some cases are not 
allowed. Cross section sample number 1 is shown in Figure 35, it is put together with several 
light microscope photographs. 
 
Figure 35. Cross section sample number 1, overview 
The face sheets will be referred to as the letters a to d respectively from the top to the bottom. 
The first big flaw that is visible is the spatter between face sheet c and d to the left in Figure 
35. The position where the spatter originates from is shown in Figure 36. 
 
Figure 36. Origination point of spatter in cross section sample no. 1 
It seems like the spatter contains of mostly face sheet c. Cracks have formed close to the 
spatter origination point, mostly on face sheet d. An inclusion has been formed near the 
spatter origination point. Most of the flaws are concentrated to the edge of the weld which is 
considered not to be approved. Face sheets a and b have failed to merge at the outer part of 
the weld as seen in Figure 36. Lack of fusion seems to be common along the whole cross 
section, see Figure 37. 
 
40 
 
 
Figure 37. Lack of fusion in cross section sample number 1 
It is most likely that face sheets b and c have fused in a satisfying way in most of the weld. It 
means that the merging failure only occurs within each separate HybrixTM sheet. The lack of 
fusion causes the current to take other paths with lower resistance and that is the probable 
reason for the spatter between face sheet c and d. Lack of fusion between a-b and c-d is most 
likely caused by remaining core material that prohibit fusion to occur. 
An overview of cross section sample number 2 is shown in Figure 38. 
 
Figure 38. Cross section sample number 2, overview 
The biggest visible flaw is the spatter between face sheet c and d. The spatter origination point 
is shown in Figure 39. 
 
Figure 39. Detail view of cross section sample number 2 
The spatter origination point is where the inclusion is positioned. The overheating followed 
by spatter has started in the contact area between face sheet b and c, just like in cross section 
sample number 1. Merging failure can also be seen in Figure 39, to the right. Like in cross 
section sample number 1 face sheets b and c seem to have been merged in an accepted way. 
Likewise the probable reason for the spatter is merging failure in between each HybrixTM 
sheet respectively. The cavity digging into face sheet d from the outside is most likely some 
form of defect that has been caused during preparation of the sample. This defect was not 
visible before the spot weld was cut in half. 
 
41 
 
4.2.3 Adhesive and steel fiber structure analysis 
A sample of HybrixTM Light 102 was torn apart and Figure 40 shows the inside of the sheet. 
 
Figure 40. The inside of a HybrixTM Light 102 sheet 
The adhesive and metal fibers seem to have formed a bulk. The bulk was separated from the 
top face sheet and the result is shown in Figure 41.

4.3 Component no 1: Rear floor - evaluation of possible material 
shift from mild steel to HybrixTM 
The first component to be subjected to evaluation is the rear floor of the body of Opel 
Insignia. In the following sub chapters pros and cons of a theoretical material shift will be 
presented. Solutions for problems that have been found regarding the material shift are 
suggested in some extent. 
4.3.1 Description of the rear floor 
Figure 42, Figure 43 and Figure 44 shows the rear floor. 
 
Figure 42. Top view of rear floor, Opel Insignia [Courtesy of SAAB Automobile AB]

Figure 44. Underside view no 2 of rear floor, Opel Insignia [Courtesy of SAAB Automobile AB] 
The rear floor is placed in the rear part of the car, see Figure 45. 
 
44 
 
 
Figure 45. Rear floor placement in the automobile body [Courtesy of SAAB Automobile AB] 
The rear floor is formed in four steps where it is first deep drawn then the holes and flanges 
are made in the last three steps. The steel sheet area of the blank, before deep drawing, is 
2150x1710 mm and the total weight of the rear floor is 17.2 kg. The material is cold rolled, 
heat galvanized steel with a original thickness of 0.8 mm. The steel has yield strength of 140-
200 MPa and ultimate strength of 270-350 MPa. The rear floor assembly contains of several 
components that are mounted onto the rear floor, see Figure 46. 
 
45 
 
 
Figure 46. Rear floor assembly [Courtesy of SAAB Automobile AB] 
The assembly components in Figure 46 that are marked with arrows have to withstand certain 
strains, these are presented in Table 11.

All of the assembly components are spot welded to the rear floor, if not directly, through the 
use of a bracket. The rear floor itself is spot welded to surrounding body work. The sides at 
the rear part of the rear floor which are aligned in the driving direction are spot welded to the 
rear rails which are open until the rear floor seals them, see Figure 47. 
 
Figure 47. Simplified view of the rear floor connection to the rear rails 
The placement of the rear rails on the automobile body can be seen in Figure 48. 
 
Figure 48. Rear rails [Courtesy of SAAB Automobile AB] 
The strength of the sealed rear rail is desired to distribute rear crash impact loads to the sides 
of the automobile. This means that the rear floor will need to contribute to this strength as 
well because it completes the rear rails. The rear floor also completes cross members placed 
above and under the rear floor, in the same way as for the rear rail, see Figure 49. 
 
47 
 
 
Figure 49. Cross member on top of and under the rear floor [Courtesy of SAAB Automobile AB] 
The open construction of the cross members are sealed with the rear floor being spot welded 
to them. The main objective for the cross members is to give adequate torsion stiffness to the 
body and also prohibit fatigue and give high strength for side crash impact loads. 
The spot weld joints that connect the rear floor to the surrounding body work consist of two or 
three sheets in overlap joints, T-joints or the two combined. The thicknesses of the sheets vary 
from each joint. 
The lower surface of the rear floor faces the outside environment. The outside environment is 
in some cases dry and in some cases wet. This means that the surface is exposed to salt water 
during winter time. On the areas that are submitted to wear from road particles and gravel, 
like the underside of the spare wheel well, a coat of PVC is sprayed on, see Figure 50. 
 
48 
 
 
Figure 50. Area submitted to wear [Courtesy of SAAB Automobile AB] 
 This coat works as protection against wear. 
4.3.2 The advantages 
The big advantage is that a substantial amount of weight can be reduced by switching to 
HybrixTM from mild steel. In Table 12 weight reduction is presented for the standard types of 
HybrixTM compared to mild steel.

The figures have been rounded off to even numbers. To match the strength of the mild steel 
the thickness of the HybrixTM sheet need to be larger than that of the mild steel. 
The NVH-properties in the environment surrounding the rear floor will be changed due to the 
muteness of the HybrixTM sheet. It will probably contribute to a quieter interior environment. 
 
49 
 
4.3.3 Issue no 1: Corrosion 
There are two specific kinds of corrosion forms, on the side of the regular corrosion forms 
that normally are associated with automobiles, which will affect the HybrixTM component. 
If the HybrixTM components is in direct contact with any other component made from 
galvanized steel the risk of galvanic corrosion is high if both of the components are drenched 
in a conductive liquid such as salt water from winter roads. 
The rear floor forming may leave residual stresses in the HybrixTM sheet. Together with a 
corrosive medium containing chloride, such as salt water, stress corrosion cracking (SCC) 
may occur. 
If the protective layers on the underside of the rear floor is chipped or scratched it will be 
subjected to uniform corrosion. A corrosion rate of 0.1 mm a year is not at all acceptable due 
to the thin face sheets of HybrixTM. If an area of the face sheet is consumed it will cause water 
absorption. 
The solution for avoiding galvanic corrosion is to electrically isolate the HybrixTM sheet from 
the surrounding bodywork. This means that spot welds are ruled out in some extent. The rear 
floor assembly contains of components that are spot welded to the rear floor. The direct 
contact between some of the components, which are exposed to the automobile interior, and 
the rear floor will not be subdued to salt water and therefore can be spot welded. There are 
several alternatives, and they are presented here. 
 Double adhesive tape 
 Structural adhesive 
 Pop rivets 
 Huck fasteners 
 Eckold clinches with adhesive 
The types of double adhesive tapes that may be suitable are double adhesive tape without 
backing material and double adhesive structural tape. Examples of these tapes are VHB (Very 
High Bond) and SBT (Structural Bond tape) tape which the company 3M markets. The SBT 
tape should be used if the structural stiffness requirement is too high for the VHB tape to 
fulfill. 
Structural adhesives that may be suitable for this application are heat curing single component 
epoxy or elastomer. Both adhesives may fulfill the structural stiffness and crash impact 
requirements while providing the component isolation. 
Pop rivets can be used if the isolation is sufficient. A suitable isolation around a pop rivet is 
shown in Figure 51. 
 
50 
 
 
Figure 51. Electrically isolated joint 
It is important that the isolating parts, marked with letters A, B and C, are not electrically 
conductive. Part A can be defined as a washer and a bushing combined. Part C can be defined 
as a washer. Part B must run along the whole overlap joint so that the sheets are electrically 
separated everywhere. Suitable pop-rivet types for this application would be long- or short-
brake mandrel type. The short-break mandrel type ought to be used if stick-out is not desired. 
Huck fasteners can also be used if suitable isolation, like the type in Figure 51, is applied to 
the joint. 
Part B could preferably be exchanged to suitable structural adhesive or double adhesive tape 
to both secure the electrical isolation and provide with greater strength to the joint. 
Eckold clinches combined with adhesives may also be a suitable alternative because it 
provides good joint strength and also may give the wanted protection against galvanic 
corrosion. Suitably adhesive would be applied to the whole joint area and Eckold clinches be 
placed with suitable distance to get the desired stiffness and strength. The adhesive will not 
only isolate but also contribute greatly to the strength of the joint. 
4.3.4 Issue no 2: Open edges 
The open edges of the HybrixTM components must be sealed so that corrosive media cannot be 
absorbed by the sheet. The problem is solved by applying the usual PVC substance which will 
seal of the open edges and thus avoiding corrosive media to penetrate the HybrixTM sheet. 
4.3.5 Issue no 4: Deep drawing 
The rear floor is deep drawn in one step and that may not be achievable with a HybrixTM 
sheet. There is little knowledge in deep drawing of HybrixTM. This knowledge must be further 
developed and simulation must be done to keep down tryout costs due to trial and error 
forming. The rear floor is a large component that may require the deep drawing process to be 
executed in more than one step. 
4.3.6 Issue no 5: Material cost 
A shift from common galvanized sheet steel to HybrixTM inherits increased material cost.  
 
4.4 Component no 2: Dash panel – evaluation of possible material 
shift from mild steel to HybrixTM 
The second component that is subjected to evaluation of a theoretical material shift from mild 
steel to HybrixTM is the dash panel. 
 
51 
 
4.4.1 Description of the dash panel 
Figure 52, Figure 53, Figure 54 and Figure 55 shows the dash panel.

Figure 55. View no 4 of dash panel, Opel insignia [Courtesy of SAAB Automobile AB] 
The dash panel is the panel that separates the engine compartment and the passenger/driver 
compartment, see Figure 56. 
 
Figure 56. Placement of dash panel in the automobile body [Courtesy of SAAB Automobile AB] 
The dash panel is formed just like the rear floor, in four steps. The component is deep drawn 
in one step, the next three steps consists of forming flanges and holes. The blank area is 
1660x945 mm and the component weighs 7.3 kg. The steel sheet is cold rolled and heat 
galvanized with yield strength of 140-200 Mpa and ultimate strength of 270-350 Mpa. The 
 
53 
 
blank thickness is 0.85 mm. The complete dash panel assembly consists of several 
components that are joined to the dash panel, see Figure 57. 
 
Figure 57. Dash panel assembly [Courtesy of SAAB Automobile AB] 
Figure 57 shows the side of the dash panel that is directed into the engine compartment. The 
different joints that integrate the dash into the surrounding body work consists of both three 
and four sheets in overlap, T-joint or a combination of both. The different components are 
spot welded to the dash panel. The holes in the dash panel are run through holes for cable 
hanks. Several weld studs are placed on the dash panel. Many components are mounted onto 
the weld studs at a later stage in the manufacturing process. This means that the weld studs 
will have to bare load which the dash panel provides through robustness and stiffness. 
The assembly composition on top of the dash panel in Figure 57 is called the plenum and the 
strongly contributes to the torsion stiffness of the car as it acts like a cross member. This 
means that the dash panel will also have to take up torsion loads and therefore contribute to 
the whole body torsion stiffness.  
The dash panel prohibits the engine and gearbox noise from travelling into the 
passenger/driver compartment by greatly reducing sound transmission via the deadeners that 
are bonded to large areas of the panel. 
The lower side of the dash panel is in some extent submitted to wet environment. A plastic 
shield covers the underside of the engine compartment which in some extent prohibits water 
to come in contact with the dash panel, but moisture and water will in some cases definitely 
come in contact with the panel. 
 
54 
 
4.4.2 The advantages 
A big advantage is that a shift from mild steel to HybrixTM will greatly reduce the weight of 
the component, see Table 13.

As with the rear floor, a thicker sheet of HybrixTM may be needed to match the strength of the 
mild steel. 
If higher sound transmission loss is desired thicker deadeners may be used. Additional 
deadeners may be added to the extent that matches the reduced weight on the dash panel. This 
will result in a component that has the same weight as for mild steel but with greater sound 
transmission loss. 
4.4.3 Issue no 1: Corrosion 
The corrosion issue regarding the dash panel can be handled in the same way as for the rear 
floor, see chapter 4.3.3. Though, the corrosive environment is not as severe for the dash panel 
in comparison with the rear floor. 
4.4.4 Issue no 2: Open edges 
The open edges are more or less a general issue concerning HybrixTM. The issue can be 
handled in the same way as for the rear floor, see chapter 4.3.4. 
4.4.5 Issue no 4: Deep drawing 
The dash panel is a quite complex component that will be difficult to deep draw without 
simulating first to get the process parameters right, see chapter 4.3.5. 
4.4.6 Issue no 5: Projection weld studs 
Projection weld studs cannot be welded to the HybrixTM component in way that gives 
sufficient strength. The face sheets do not provide enough thickness for the weld stud to be 
sufficiently joined to the HybrixTM component. To be able to mount the components that is 
usually mounted on weld studs for the mild steel version of the dash panel some alternative 
must be used instead. 
One solution may be to adjust the production of the HybrixTM sheet and place solid metal 
plates between the face sheets in the places where the weld stud is later to be placed. The 
metal plate thickness ought to match the distance between the face sheets. This will give an 
area that corresponds to solid metal which qualifies for the projection weld stud. A schematic 
view over the principle of this alternative is shown in Figure 58. 
 
55 
 
 
Figure 58. Schematic view over weld stud soulution 
Another alternative is to place the projection weld stud onto a console that can be joined to the 
HybrixTM dash panel, see Figure 59. 
 
Figure 59. Projection weld stud solution 
The console itself can be joined to the HybrixTM dash panel with any suitable joining method. 
Suitable joining methods may be spot welding, clinching, riveting, structural adhesive, double 
adhesive tape etc.

CHAPTER INTRODUCTION 
The conclusions that the authors have drawn during the Master of Science thesis are presented 
in this chapter. The conclusions are based from the analysis with the intention to answer the 
formulation of questions that is presented in Chapter 1. The conclusions have the purpose to 
provide recommendations for future work presented in Chapter 7.   
 HybrixTM cannot be spot welded to galvanized steel with the setup used in the tests of 
this thesis work. 
 HybrixTM can be spot welded to itself with fairly good results with the setup used is 
the tests of this thesis work. 
 The core of HybrixTM Light 102 consists of mostly adhesive and steel fibres and very 
little air. 
 Galvanic corrosion problems that may affect a HybrixTM rear floor or dash panel is 
solved by electrically isolating the component from surrounding galvanized steel body 
work. 
 Instead of spot welding, alternative joining techniques or fastening systems can be 
used to join a HybrixTM component to surrounding body work and to attach 
components such as belt buckle brackets to the HybrixTM component. 
 Electrical insulation of a HybrixTM component can be obtained with several joining 
techniques and fastening systems. 
 There is an alternative to projection welding of studs directly onto a HybrixTM 
component. 
 Theoretically there is a substantial amount of weight to save if material is shifted from 
solid sheet steel to HybrixTM on large components. 
 The open edges of a HybrixTM component must be sealed accurately to avoid liquid 
absorption. 
 A HybrixTM rear floor inherits fragility towards harsh wear from road objects and 
particles like gravel and thus will need additional thickness of PVC coating on the 
underside. 
 Sheet thickness of a HybrixTM component must probably be higher than that of a solid 
steel 
 Implementation of HybrixTM in the automobile body inherits large costs. Those costs 
contain of higher material prices and tool and manufacturing investing costs.

 CHAPTER 6 
6 DISCUSSION AND RECOMMENDATION 
CHAPTER INTRODUCTION 
In this chapter the conclusions that the authors have drawn during the work are discussed and 
how future work in this field should proceed.  
6.1 Spot welding of HybrixTM 
Here spot welding of HybrixTM and factors affecting the results are discussed and 
recommendation on further work within the area proposed. 
6.1.1 Spot welding of HybrixTM towards galvanized steel 
Spot welding of HybrixTM against galvanized steel seems to be impossible with the tool and 
parameter setup that we used in the tests we conducted. The higher resistance of the zinc layer 
on the steel sheet is the probable reason for the problem. The fact that the galvanized steel 
sheet has lower heat conductivity also contributes to the problem. The fusion zone is 
displaced towards HybrixTM and the face sheets burn and stick to the electrode. This means 
that it may be favorable to use thicker face sheets on HybrixTM that is to be spot welded to 
galvanized steel sheets. I do not claim that it is impossible to weld HybrixTM towards 
galvanized steel but tests conducted in this thesis work shows that more work need to be done 
concerning this spot welding combination. Further spot weld testing should implicate welding 
with other electrode types and also other electrode material. Further testing would favorably 
involve HybrixTM with thicker face sheets so that it matches the thickness of the galvanized 
sheets it is welded towards. This implies a smaller or non existing weight reductive 
advantage. On the other hand it gives a HybrixTM sheet that has higher flexural stiffness due to 
the thicker face sheets. It may be favorable to think of using some other joining technique 
aside spot welding. The different joining techniques or fastening systems are discussed further 
down in this chapter. 
6.1.2 Spot welding of HybrixTM towards HybrixTM 
Spot welding of HybrixTM to HybrixTM is of little significance for the automobile body unless 
most of the body is manufactured from HybrixTM. Testing if this sample group was meant to 
act as some sort of reference to compare the strength of the HybrixTM to galvanized steel spot 
welds. Due to the bad results from the latter the HybrixTM to HybrixTM sample group is rather 
useless for the weldability investigation conducted in this thesis work. But it gives indications 
that spot welding of HybrixTM Light 102 inherits face sheet bulging in the spot weld area. 
Bulges are not acceptable because they are non predictable and implies geometrical 
differences in the automobile body. 
6.1.3 Effects of core composition 
An investigation of the core of HybrixTM Light 102 was conducted and it showed that it did 
not contain as much air as expected. The adhesive layers seem to build up such thickness that 
they are not very well separated. When the spot weld was placed near the edge of the 
HybrixTM sheet gas evacuation caused the sheet to delaminate. The delaminating occurred 
 
58 
 
between the outer face sheet and the core. This shows that it was easier for the gas to separate 
the core from the face sheet rather than evacuating in the allegedly air containing core. When 
looking at HybrixTM Light 202 it is more obvious that the face sheets are well separated and 
that the core is contains of much air due to the longer fibers in comparison to HybrixTM Light 
102. Spot welding of HybrixTM types with 2 mm fibers may be more suitable because the 
carburized adhesive probably will be able to evacuate much easier thus avoiding bulging. 
6.2 Body components made from HybrixTM 
Manufacturing components from HybrixTM instead of galvanized steel inherits many issues to 
deal with and here I will discuss it along with solutions and possible measures that can be 
taken. 
6.2.1 Advantages with usage of HybrixTM for automotive applications 
The advantages of using HybrixTM instead of steel are few but of great importance. That 
weight can be saved is obvious but to match the strength of a steel component the material 
thickness of the component will have to be thicker than its solid steel sheet peer. This and 
other factors imply redesign of the component. The HybrixTM sheet may not be able to be 
deep drawn into the same shape as the component is today. This means that the component 
will have to be purposely designed for HybrixTM. 
The NVH advantage has to be investigated more thoroughly for automotive application. 
Experts say that the dampening characteristics are seemingly good based upon values from 
information provided by Lamera AB. This would mean that it dampens vibrations good which 
is wanted for all body components to avoid noise and unwanted vibrations. Testing of 
transmission loss and loss factor is seemingly the most interesting properties to investigate 
further. 
6.2.2 Corrosion 
The issue of galvanic corrosion with stainless steel in an automobile body is one of the most 
significant problems with implementation of HybrixTM. If comparing the two components 
investigated the rear floor is the component with the harshest environment regarding 
corrosion. The environment under the rear floor is considered to be wet and saltwater will be 
present all over the underside and the joints in worst case. The underside of the rear floor may 
be submitted to scratches, dents and chips which in worst case will penetrate the face sheet of 
the HybrixTM component. That would mean that the material can absorb salt water and start 
corroding from the inside. Scratches and chips in the coatings open the opportunity for 
electrical current to flow and a galvanic cell to be formed. 
Experts at SAAB Automobile AB associates stainless steel in the body work with problems. 
Corrosion problems have risen in the past when stainless steel have been used in the 
automobile body work at SAAB Automobile AB. 
The issue of open edges must be taken into account because absorption of corrosive media 
will cause internal corrosion. The regular PVC sealing of joints should be adequate to seal off 
the edges of the HybrixTM components. 
 
59 
 
 
6.2.3 Electrical insulation 
The solution to electrically isolate the HybrixTM component from surrounding body work 
inherits many plausible solutions. The most important thing is to avoid contact between 
HybrixTM and galvanized steel. The electrical insulation will cause an issue with the electro 
coating of the BIW. If fully isolated the electro coat will not adhere to the HybrixTM 
component. This may be solved by electrically connecting the HybrixTM component to the 
surrounding body work temporarily, during electro coating. The electrical insulation could 
most favorably be combined with a joining technique. 
6.2.4 Alternatives for welding 
As presented there are many fastening systems and joining techniques that can replace the 
spot weld and cope with the galvanic corrosion issue. According to me some combination 
including adhesive bonding of some sort would be the most fulfilling regarding corrosion 
protection and strength. To obtain maximum strength of the joint structural adhesive like 
single-component epoxy or SBT ought to be used. To also obtain the resistance to peeling one 
of the proposed fastening systems ought to be used. The most interesting fastening system or 
joining technique is according to me the Eckold clinch. It has been successfully used in 
automobiles where joining of aluminum and galvanized steel has been done. The Eckold 
clinch in combination with adhesive is seemingly the best alternative if it provides the wanted 
electrical isolation. Further work should be conducted concerning this combination where the 
possibility of joining a HybrixTM sheet and a galvanized steel sheet should be investigated. 
The thin face sheets of HybrixTM may imply problems where cracks may occur due to large 
forces. The electrical insulation of an Eckold clinch in combination with adhesive can be 
tested at first with only regular galvanized steel sheets. Thus testing of Eckold clinching 
HybrixTM to galvanized sheet steel can be conducted parallel to insulation testing of Eckold 
clinching in combination with adhesive. 
Other fastening systems proposed, aside of Eckold clinching, can also favorably be combined 
with adhesive but must also have non electrically conducting spacers and washers to ensure 
the insulation of a HybrixTM component. 
Projection weld studs cannot be attached directly to a HybrixTM sheet but the solution I have 
come up with is quite simple. The console or attachment plate inherits more manufacturing 
steps but should fulfill the purpose of a weld stud completely. Attaching the console with 
double adhesive tape like VHB is very interesting. It inherits simple attachment procedure and 
the VHB tape should give enough strength and also peel resistance. The VHB requires no 
curing procedure but will allow the console to flex a little due to the visco elastic behavior. 
Though, I believe that using VHB tape for this application is suitable concerning fatigue 
because it dampens vibrations thus prohibiting these from transmitting to the dash panel. 
6.2.5 Forming of HybrixTM 
HybrixTM can evidentially be formed with deep drawing but trial and error testing is not 
economically defendable in the automotive industry today. Simulation using the finite 
element method is very important and today it is not impossible because a material model for 
 
60 
 
HybrixTM does not exist at present. Until forming of HybrixTM can be simulated it is 
impossible to know exactly what is possible and what is not. 
6.2.6 Increasing costs 
The fact that HybrixTM is more expensive than common sheet steel is obvious. Manufacturing 
changes have to be made to implement HybrixTM. It is impossible today to say how costly it 
would be because nothing has yet been established concerning manufacturing processes and 
so regarding HybrixTM. 
For example if pop-riveting is compared to Eckold clinching the investment cost of the former 
is a lot lower than the latter that inherits heavy and technically advanced tooling.
