Sammanfattning 
HCCI-motorn (Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition) är lovande då det gäller låga 
utsläpp av NOx, låga partikelutsläpp och hög verkningsgrad. På grund av dess homogena 
bränsleblandning, där förbränningen startar nästan samtidigt i ett antal punkter i 
förbränningsrummet, kan endast magra bränsleblandningar förbrännas med anledning av den 
snabba förbränningen, vilken är mycket snabbare än i en ottomotor eller dieselmotor. Om fetare 
bränsleblandningar förbränns startar förbränningen tidigare och blir våldsammare. 
 
För att fasa förbränningen senare och sänka förbränningshastigheten kan extern, kyld EGR 
användas. EGR-systemet som används i detta examensarbete använder sig av en delad 
avgaskanal, där den ena kanalen och ventilen används för att föra tillbaka EGR till insugssidan. 
EGR-ventilen öppnar alltså mot insugstrycket. Detta system kallas Direct-EGR (D-EGR). 
 
Motorprov verifierade att CA50 verkligen senareläggs då kyld EGR används. Ju mer kyld EGR 
som finns i förbränningsrummet, desto senare fasas CA50. Därmed kan effektuttaget i HCCI-
motorn höjas då stora EGR-mängder används på grund av möjligheten att spruta in en större 
mängd bränsle. 
 
Simuleringar i GT-Power kördes för att bestämma hur EGR-ventilen och avgasventilen skall 
lyftas för att föra tillbaka en viss mängd EGR med så god totalverkningsgrad som möjligt. 
Simuleringarna visade att två olika ventiltidsstrategier bör användas. Vilken av dessa strategier 
som skall användas beror på tryckskillnaden mellan insug och avgas samt motorvarvtalet. Dessa 
ventiltidsstrategier kallas Major lift strategy och Minor lift strategy. 
 
För att bestämma hur effektivt D-EGR-systemet är, genomfördes en jämförelse med ett externt 
EGR-system. Jämförelsen visade att D-EGR-systemet är ett väl fungerande system, speciellt vid 
hög last och lågt motorvarvtal. Vid höga motorvarvtal ökar strömningsförlusterna, vilket 
påverkar D-EGR-systemet på ett negativt sätt. Vid låg last kan insugstrycket överstiga 
avgastrycket, vilket gör det ogynnsamt att göra en del av avgasslaget med EGR-ventilen öppen 
mot det högre insugstrycket.  
 
När det gäller D-EGR-systemets transienta respons påvisades det att systemet är snabbt, med 
möjlighet att ändra EGR-mängd inom ett par cykler.

Abstract 
The Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine is promising in terms of low 
NOx, low particulates and high efficiency. Due to its homogeneous charge, where the 
combustion starts almost simultaneously from a number of points in the combustion chamber, 
only lean mixtures are possible to burn because of the resulting rapid combustion, which is much 
faster than the combustion in an SI-engine or a diesel engine. When richer mixtures are used the 
combustion will start earlier and also be more violent. 
 
To phase the combustion later and lower the combustion speed, external cooled EGR can be 
used. The EGR-system used in this thesis uses a divided exhaust channel where one channel and 
its corresponding valve are used only for transporting EGR back to the intake system. 
Consequently the EGR-valve is connected to the intake pressure. This system is called Direct-
EGR (D-EGR). 
 
Engine tests verified that the CA50 indeed is phased later when cooled EGR is used. The more 
cooled EGR that is available in the combustion chamber, the later the CA50 is phased. Hence 
power output of the HCCI-engine can be improved quite a bit when large EGR-rates are used, 
because of the possibility of increasing the injected fuel amount. 
 
Simulations in GT-Power were made to determine how the EGR-valve lift and exhaust valve lift 
should be made to transfer a certain amount of EGR with as good total efficiency as possible. 
The simulations showed that two different valve timing strategies should be used. Which one of 
the two strategies that should be used depends on the pressure difference between the intake and 
the exhaust as well as the engine speed. These valve timing strategies are called the Major lift 
strategy and the Minor lift strategy. 
 
To determine the efficiency of the D-EGR-system, a comparison with an ordinary external EGR 
system was carried out. The comparison showed that the D-EGR-system performs well, 
especially at high load and low engine speeds. At high engine speeds the increase in flow losses 
affects the performance in a negative way for the D-EGR-system. At low load the intake 
pressure may exceed the exhaust pressure, which makes it unbeneficial to do a part of the 
exhaust stroke with the EGR-valve open towards the higher intake pressure. 
 
In terms of transient response the D-EGR-system was proven to be fast, with a possibility to 
change the EGR-rate in just a couple of cycles.

1 Introduction 
The increasing demand for more efficient engines with lower emissions has led to that 
great efforts have to be made with the diesel engine and the SI-engine to meet the 
legislations. The diesel engine suffers from high particulate emissions and high levels 
of NOx due to problems concerning the diesel combustion. The SI-engine’s main 
problem is its poor efficiency, especially at part load. This has to do with the throttled 
intake and the low compression ratio. 
 
Homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) has many advantages compared to 
the diesel engine and the SI-engine. Due to its lean homogenous charge, it has nearly 
zero particulate emissions and very low NOx without the need of an exhaust after-
treatment system. The efficiency is also comparable with the diesel engine, even at 
part load. However, there are still several problems concerning how to get HCCI to 
work properly in real applications. One of the main problems is how to control the 
violent combustion that is caused by the homogeneous compression ignition. This is 
mainly a problem at high load and has in previous studies been managed by closing 
the inlet valves later and thereby phasing the combustion later to reduce the knock 
intensity. 
 
This thesis focuses on using cooled EGR to control the maximum pressure rate and 
pressure rise at high load. For this purpose a special direct-EGR-system was used 
which uses one of the two hydraulically actuated exhaust valves to transfer EGR into 
the intake system. The work was carried out both by simulating the engine in the 
simulation program GT-Power and by running engine tests with a single cylinder 
HCCI-engine. 
3 
2 Background 
2.1 The HCCI-engine 
The HCCI-engine is a combination of the SI-engine and the Diesel engine. The 
combustion charge is premixed as in an SI-engine and is during the compression 
exposed to high pressure and high temperature causing it to self-ignite as in a Diesel 
engine. The combustion starts from a number of points in the combustion chamber, 
where the heterogeneities in air/fuel ratio and temperature have created ignitable 
conditions. Due to that the self-ignition is similar to a diesel engine, lean mixtures can 
be ignited, which means the engine can be operated unthrottled, and as a result the 
pumping losses are reduced. Due to the rapid combustion controlled by chemical 
reactions, only lean mixtures are possible to burn, as richer mixtures lead to a faster 
combustion and a high cylinder pressure and pressure rise, which will put the engine 
into severe mechanical stress. 
 
As the combustion takes place at lean conditions, the combustion temperature is quite 
low which results in low NOx-emissions. Air/fuel charge that has reached down in 
narrow crevices will not burn and will for that reason result in HC emissions. Thus the 
HCCI-engine in comparison to the diesel engine shows comparatively high HC 
emissions, but is in the range of an SI-engine and can be treated with an oxidation 
catalyst. It is also difficult to control the start of combustion in an HCCI-engine. One 
way is to use the IVC-method, with different closing times of the inlet valves. This 
works by affecting the effective compression of the engine which in turn affects 
pressure, trapped mass and temperature during the compression stroke. Since the 
compression does not start until the intake valves are closed, a late IVC reduces the 
pressure and temperature, thus CA50 is delayed. 
2.2 Effect of EGR 
One effect of EGR is that it decreases the oxygen concentration in the combustion 
chamber. As there is less oxygen available, CA50 is phased later as the peak 
temperature and pressure reached during combustion for a given amount of fuel is 
lower. Figure 1 shows the simulated cylinder temperature during combustion with the 
same amount of injected fuel, with and without EGR.

The combustion products presented in the exhaust gases, H20 and CO2, have much 
higher heat capacity than N2, which also serve to reduce the cylinder temperature 
during compression. Figure 2 shows the simulated cylinder temperature during 
compression at the same conditions as in figure 1.

The main effect of EGR though, when applied on HCCI, is chemical, meaning that the 
introduction of burned gas molecules in the combustion chamber interferes with the 
reactions between the fuel- and oxygen molecules. Thereby the combustion is phased 
later and the combustion duration is increased. Figure 3 shows the heat release from 
two engine tests with a small difference in EGR-rate.

pin=2.2 bar, pexh=1.94 bar 
 
As the EGR-rate difference is as low as 1.9 %, the difference in compression- and 
combustion temperature between the two cases is very small. Thus the temperature 
has little or no affect on the phasing of CA50. Hence the major effect of cooled EGR 
on HCCI is the above mentioned chemical reactions. 
 
If external cooled EGR is used, CA50 will be phased later, so to reach the desired 
CA50 the effective compression will have to be increased by moving the IVC earlier, 
leading to a higher volumetric efficiency. The increase in volumetric efficiency results 
in a larger charge mass, which allows more fuel to be injected in the cylinder. Thus 
the EGR-rate should be chosen so that IVC can be placed where the engine reaches its 
maximum volumetric efficiency.

3.1 Engine specification  
The test engine is a single cylinder HCCI-engine based on a Scania D12 cylinder with 
data as described in table 1.

The engine, shown in figure 4, has an external compressor, which is capable of 
producing intake pressures up to 6 bar, and the exhaust backpressure can be set by 
closing a valve in the exhaust system. The fuel system is port injection and the fuel 
used is regular 98 RON gasoline. For the engine tests the engine is also equipped with 
an EGR-system where one exhaust valve is used solely for EGR. The EGR-system is 
described in detail in chapter 3.3. 
 
 
 
Figure 4 The test bed 
 
7 
3.2 The Active Valve Train system (AVT) 
The AVT-system is a hydraulic valve system, which allows the four valves to be 
independently controlled of each other. The system has space for 255 predefined 
valve lift profiles that at any time during operation can be changed as well as the 
valve lift phasing. Thus this system provides great freedom of choosing the required 
valve timing and it allows fast changes during operation. 
3.3 The Direct-EGR-system (D-EGR) 
The D-EGR-system is shown in figure 5 and is built as follows; the channel between 
the two exhaust valves in the cylinder head is divided into two separate channels. One 
channel is then coupled back to the intake through tubes and an EGR-cooler. The 
other channel (exhaust valve) is used as usual i.e. getting rid of exhaust gases. 
 
The PWM-controlled valve controls the cooling water flow through the EGR-cooler. 
In the engine tests the valve was adjusted until a temperature after the EGR-cooler of 
60 ˚C was reached. The reason for this was to ensure a stable intake air temperature at 
60 ˚C no matter what the EGR-rate was. This intake temperature is reasonable when 
using supercharging, and a large amount of engine test data was available from 
previous tests at this intake temperature. 
 
Engine tests showed that the EGR-cooler had a more than enough cooling capacity as 
there was never a need to exceed more than 10 % of its total water flow capacity. 
Pressure sensors were available both before and after the EGR-cooler. This way the 
possibility was given to analyze any pressure fall or pressure pulses over the EGR-
cooler. 
 
 
 
Figure 5 Principal schematic of the Direct-EGR-system 
 
8 
The D-EGR-system is fast, meaning that a change in EGR-rate is possible in just a 
couple of cycles by changing the valve timing. It is also always possible to transfer 
EGR to the intake no matter what the pressure difference between intake and exhaust 
is. Another benefit appears when the exhaust pressure is higher than the intake 
pressure and a certain amount of EGR is necessary, such may be the case at high load 
because of the low exhaust gas temperature when running HCCI. With this system 
two full valve lifts towards the higher exhaust pressure is not necessary so the gas 
exchange work is reduced, as some of the work is done towards the lower intake 
pressure.  
 
The disadvantages with the D-EGR-system are that it requires a variable valve system 
to make adjustments of the EGR-rate, and because only one exhaust valve is available 
for getting rid of exhaust gases, the flow losses could become large in cases when 
little or no EGR is wanted. 
 
Figure 6 shows a picture of the D-EGR-system taken in the test cell.

4 The GT-Power models 
4.1 The D-EGR-model 
The engine, when fitted with the Direct-EGR-system, is modelled in GT-Power, as 
shown in figure 7. As can be seen, one of the two exhaust valves is used only for 
transporting EGR back to the intake of the engine. 
 
 
 
Figure 7 GT-Power-model with Direct-EGR-system 
 
The EGR-cooler is modelled as fifty-six identical pipes with a diameter of 8.92 mm 
and a length of 540 mm. During simulation the wall temperature of the pipes is set to 
60 °C and the heat convection coefficient of the pipes is set very high (1*1017 
W/m2K), which means the temperature after the EGR-cooler always is around 60 °C 
which is the same temperature as the intake air. The reason for this is to ensure stable 
intake air temperature when varying the EGR-rate. The CD-values for the valves used 
in simulations come from standard measurements.

To simulate the engine with turbo charging, the exhaust pressure was calculated using 
equation 1 with the variables specified in table 2. The equation does not take the 
pressure loss through the valves into account.

Turbocharger efficiency 
[%/100] 
 
During simulations, turbocharger efficiencies of both 60 % and 80 % were assumed. 
This includes the turbine as well as the compressor. The κ-values used for calculations 
are average values taken from simulations in GT-Power. The temperature at the 
turbine inlet (T1t) was taken from GT-Power and the temperature before the 
compressor (T1k) was set to ambient 293K. 
 
The temperature at the turbine inlet (exhaust temperature) is mostly affected by the 
amount of fuel being burnt in the cylinder, thus λ affects the exhaust temperature the 
most. This means that low λ equals high exhaust temperature and vice versa. The 
higher the exhaust temperature is the lower the exhaust pressure is for a given intake 
pressure and turbo efficiency. 
11 
4.2 The external EGR model 
The comparison between the D-EGR-system and external EGR was made by running 
the engine in the simulations with a certain amount of stoichiometrically combusted 
air/fuel mixture in the intake system when simulating external EGR. 
 
The composition of the exhaust gas at stoichiometric combustion can be described 
with equation 2.

where Y is the amount of hydrogen atoms compared with the amount of coal atoms. 
The fuel used in the simulations consists of 26 hydrogen atoms and 12 coal atoms, 
which means that Y equals 2.167 in the equation. 
 
The amount of each of the exhaust gas molecules was calculated for both λ=1.2 and 
λ=3.0 by first using equation 2 and then adding a certain amount of pure air to this 
mixture depending on λ and EGR-rate.

5 Valve timing 
To evaluate the proper choice of valve timing on the EGR-valve and the exhaust 
valve, the influence of load and speed on the valve timing was investigated. 
 
As the EGR-valve opens to the intake pressure and the exhaust valve opens to the 
exhaust pressure, the pressure difference between the intake pressure and the exhaust 
pressure is of significant importance to the valve timing strategy at different loads. To 
get a certain amount of EGR into the intake, the durations of the exhaust valve and the 
EGR-valve have to be changed at different loads due to the change in pressure 
difference between the two valves. 
 
The exhaust pressures were calculated in Matlab, at the different intake pressures and 
λ-values, for turbo charging efficiencies of 60 % and 80 %. Figures 8 and 9 show how 
the exhaust pressure varies for different intake pressures at different λ-values and with 
different turbo charging efficiencies.

The figures show that a higher λ results in a higher exhaust pressure for a given intake 
pressure. This is due to that a higher λ equals lower exhaust gas temperature and thus 
lower exhaust gas energy content. 
 
A lower turbo charging efficiency also results in higher exhaust pressure to reach the 
desired intake pressure.

5.1 Valve timing strategies 
Five different valve timing strategies were tested at different loads and engine speeds 
with the goal to get the best total engine efficiency possible. The following valve 
strategies were used: 
5.1.1 Major lift strategies 
1. One major lift with the valve which opens towards the highest pressure, and 
one early, smaller lift with the valve which opens towards the lowest pressure, 
see figure 10. 
 
 
 
Figure 10 Major lift strategy 1 
15 
2. One major lift with the valve which opens towards the highest pressure, and 
one mid-time, smaller lift with the valve which opens towards the lowest

5.2 Influence of load on valve timing 
Simulations were made with intake pressures from 1.5 bar to 5.0 bar and λ-values of 
1.2 and 3.0 at 1000 rpm. The results after testing the five valve timing strategies at 
different loads showed that two of the valve timing strategies gave the highest 
efficiency and should be used individually depending on the load. In this chapter the 
two strategies are described in detail. It was also found that the design of the D-EGR-
system has great affect on the proper choice of valve timing strategy at different loads. 
The conclusions made in this chapter are based only on the design of the D-EGR-
system tested on this certain engine. 
5.2.1 The Major lift strategy 
The Major lift strategy is based on major lift strategy number 3 and consists of one 
major lift with the valve opening to the highest pressure and one smaller, late lift with 
the other valve. If the intake pressure exceeds the exhaust pressure, the major lift 
should be done with the EGR-valve and if the exhaust pressure exceeds the intake 
pressure, the major lift should be done with the exhaust valve. This strategy should be 
used when the pressure difference between intake and exhaust is less than 
approximately 2 bar. The reason for not using a minor lift strategy in these cases is 
that PMEP increases due to the short overlap period between the EGR-valve and the 
exhaust valve and the fact that the durations of both valve lifts are short. 
 
Figure 15 shows the mass flow rate and valve lift for each of the valves when using 
the Major lift strategy. 
 
 
Figure 15 Mass flow rates and valve lifts when using the Major lift strategy at 1000 rpm, 60 % turbo 
charging efficiency, 50 % EGR, 5.01 bar absolute intake pressure, 5.66 bar absolute exhaust pressure 
and λ=1.2 
 
18 
Even though a negative mass flow occurs during overlap between the EGR-valve and 
the exhaust valve, the Major lift strategy gives the highest break efficiency at pressure 
differences less than 2 bar.  
 
When using the Major lift strategy, the phasing of the smaller lift should always be 
placed in the end of the exhaust stroke. If one should do the smaller lift early in the 
exhaust stroke, the result is an even greater negative mass flow through the major lift 
valve. This is shown in figure 16. 
 
 
Figure 16 Mass flow rates and valve lifts when doing the smaller lift early at 1000 rpm, 60 % turbo 
charging efficiency, 50 % EGR, 5.01 bar absolute intake pressure, 5.66 bar absolute exhaust pressure 
and λ=1.2 
 
The great negative mass flow is a consequence of the lack of time to build up a big 
enough positive mass flow through the major lift valve before the small lift valve is 
opened. One can also see that a greater negative mass flow occurs through the intake 
valve in the beginning of the intake stroke when doing the smaller valve lift early. 
This is an effect of the increased cylinder pressure in the end of the exhaust stroke 
when having only one exhaust valve open. Also this lowers the engine efficiency 
compared to doing the smaller valve lift late. 
 
Simulations have shown a general trend that an introduction of an overlap between the 
exhaust valves and the intake valves reduces the negative mass flow through the 
intake valve and contributes to higher break efficiency. 
5.2.2 The Minor lift strategy 
The Minor lift strategy is based on minor lift strategy number 1 with one early valve 
lift with the valve opening to the highest pressure and one late valve lift with the other 
valve. This strategy should only be used when the pressure difference between intake 
and exhaust exceeds 2 bar. The reason for not using a major lift strategy when the 
19 
pressure difference exceeds 2 bar is that a massive negative mass flow occurs during 
the time where both the EGR-valve and exhaust valve are open simultaneously. The 
shorter overlap period, when using the Minor lift strategy, reduces the negative mass 
flow, thus increases the brake efficiency. The results presented are based on an 
overlap between the EGR-valve and the exhaust valve of 60 CAD. More and less 
overlap have been tested though, but not to the same extent as 60 CAD overlap. 
 
Figure 17 shows the mass flow rate and valve lift for each of the valves when using 
the Minor lift strategy. 
 
 
Figure 17 Mass flow rates and valve lifts with the Minor lift strategy at 1000 rpm, 60 % turbo charging 
efficiency, 50 % EGR, 3.51 bar absolute intake pressure, 5.95 bar absolute exhaust pressure and λ=3.0 
 
Early in the exhaust stroke a negative mass flow occurs, which is due to a pressure 
pulse travelling backwards in the exhaust system making the exhaust back pressure to 
exceed the cylinder pressure. This negative mass flow can be reduced by placing EVO 
later, thus improving brake efficiency. Despite this phenomenon, the Minor lift 
strategy gives the highest brake efficiency at these conditions. 
 
When using the Minor lift strategy, the first valve lift should always be made towards 
the highest pressure. If the first valve lift is made towards the lowest pressure, the 
break efficiency will drop due to a negative mass flow during overlap between the 
EGR-valve and the exhaust valve. In similarity with the Major lift strategy, this is a 
consequence of the lack of time to build up a positive mass flow through the valve 
opening to the highest pressure. This is shown in figure 18. 
 
20 
 
Figure 18 Mass flow rates and valve lifts when doing the first valve lift towards the lowest pressure at 
1000 rpm, 60 % turbo charging efficiency, 50 % EGR, 3.51 bar absolute intake pressure, 5.95 bar 
absolute exhaust pressure and λ=3.0 
 
One can also see in figure 18 that a greater negative mass flow occurs through the 
intake valve in the beginning of the intake stroke. This can be explained by the higher 
cylinder pressure in the end of the exhaust stroke when the valve towards the highest 
pressure is opened last. In similarity with the Major lift strategy the introduction of an 
overlap between the latest closing exhaust valve and the intake valves reduces the 
negative mass flow and contributes to higher break efficiency. 
 
Another thing to have in mind is that the optimal overlap between the exhaust valves 
will vary depending on the pressure difference between them. At higher pressure 
differences the overlap should be shorter and at lower pressure differences the overlap 
should be longer. At all times though, the overlap should be chosen as long as 
possible to minimize PMEP but still prevent the mass flow from getting too negative. 
5.2.3 Engine test conformity 
To determine the accuracy of the simulations, engine tests were performed to 
determine the difference in efficiency between the Major lift strategy and the Minor 
lift strategy at different pressure differences. 
 
Due to problems with a leaking valve in the exhaust system, it was impossible to 
achieve the pressure difference, between intake and exhaust, needed to prove the 
higher efficiency with the Minor lift strategy at high load. Instead the efficiency 
difference between the valve lift strategies at low load was established. 
 
Table 5 shows the tested and resulting parameters from the test.

The low pressure difference at this low load leads to a higher indicated total engine 
efficiency and lower pumping loss when using the Major lift strategy both in the 
simulations and the engine tests. The important conclusion from the comparison is 
that the trends seen in the simulations and the engine tests are similar with 
approximately 0.5 % difference in engine efficiency between the valve timing 
strategies. The difference in PMEP between the valve timing strategies was 0.08 bar 
in engine tests and 0.13 bar in simulations. 
22 
5.3 Influence of engine speed on valve timing 
By simulations the engine speed was found to affect the choice of appropriate valve 
timing in two different ways, which led to the following questions. 
 
1. Which is the most effective valve timing strategy depending on engine speed? 
 
2. When using the Major lift strategy, how must the smaller valve lift duration be 
chosen depending on the engine speed to keep the same amount of incoming 
EGR? 
5.3.1 Choice of valve timing strategy 
To determine the influence of engine speed on the valve timing, different engine 
speeds from 500 rpm to 1500 rpm were tested in simulations at different loads with 
absolute intake pressures from 3.5 bar to 5.0 bar with λ=1.2 and 60 % turbo charging 
efficiency. Intake- and exhaust pressures at these conditions are shown in table 6.

The Minor lift strategy and the Major lift strategy were used to see when the transition 
from one strategy to the other shall be made depending on the engine speed. Figure 21 
shows the results where the difference in total engine efficiency has been calculated 
for each case by subtracting the engine efficiency when using the Major lift strategy 
from the engine efficiency when using the Minor lift strategy.

lift strategy from the efficiency when using the Minor lift strategy at λ=1.2 and 60 % turbo charging 
efficiency for 500, 1000 and 1500 rpm 
 
The figure shows major variances in engine efficiency difference at different engine 
speeds. At these conditions it is possible to get a higher efficiency with the Minor lift 
strategy at 500 rpm, unlike the results at higher engine speeds where the Minor lift 
strategy gets more ineffective compared to the Major lift strategy as the engine speed 
rises. 
 
One explanation to this phenomenon is that a higher engine speed means a greater air 
flow through the engine, which leads to greater flow losses during overlap between 
the exhaust valves. To verify this, the pumping loss was compared for the Minor lift 
strategy and the Major lift strategy at 500 rpm and 1500 rpm with 5.0 bar absolute 
intake pressure, which is shown in figure 22.

24 
As seen in the figure, the pumping loss with the Minor lift strategy exceeds the 
pumping loss with the Major lift strategy at 1500 rpm, unlike the results at 500 rpm, 
i.e. the Minor lift strategy may be more effective at lower engine speeds. Another 
aspect of the results is that it is more likely that one gets a negative mass flow through 
one of the valves at lower engine speed with a certain pressure difference between the 
valves because of the longer time that is given for a positive mass flow to drop below 
zero.  Figures 23 to 26 are taken from GT-Power and show the valve lifts and the 
mass flow rates through the valves at 1500 rpm and 500 rpm with the two valve lift 
strategies. 
 
When comparing the mass flow rates for the Major lift strategy at 1500 rpm in figure 
23 with the Minor lift strategy at 1500 rpm in figure 24, one can see that no negative 
mass flow is received in either case. This means that the lower break efficiency for the 
Minor lift strategy in this case should be most dependent on the higher PMEP. 
 
 
 
Figure 23 The Major lift strategy at 1500 rpm, pin=5.01 bar, pexh=5.66 bar 
 
 
 
Figure 24 The Minor lift strategy at 1500 rpm, pin=5.01 bar, pexh=5.66 bar 
25 
When taking a closer look on the mass flow rate for each of the strategies at 500 rpm 
it is seen that a massive negative mass flow is received before both exhaust valves are 
open together. This occurs with the Major lift strategy in figure 25 as well as with the 
Minor lift strategy in figure 26. These negative mass flows are the result of a pressure 
pulse travelling backwards in the exhaust system. One can see though that even 
though this negative mass flow is greater when using the Minor lift strategy, the 
negative mass flow during overlap is much greater for the Major lift strategy. This is 
the result of the longer overlap between the valves when using the Major lift strategy 
and should be the reason for the lower break efficiency when using the Major lift 
strategy at these conditions. 
 
 
 
Figure 25 The Major lift strategy at 500 rpm, pin=5.01 bar, pexh=5.66 bar 
 
 
 
Figure 26 The Minor lift strategy at 500 rpm, pin=5.01 bar, pexh=5.66 bar 
 
These conclusions will remain at higher λ, but the point at which the Minor lift 
strategy will be more effective will be displaced due to the higher pressure difference 
between intake and exhaust and will be found at lower intake pressures. Therefore 
there will be a point, at for example 1000 rpm, where the Minor lift strategy is the 
26 
most effective strategy at the same load range as above. This can be seen in figure 27, 
where the total engine efficiency with the Minor lift strategy and the Major lift 
strategy are tested with absolute intake pressures from 2.2 bars to 3.5 bars, λ=3 and 
1000 rpm. Tested intake pressures and resulting exhaust pressures are shown in table 
7.

In the figure it can be seen that higher total engine efficiency is received with the 
Minor lift strategy at as low absolute intake pressures as somewhere between 3.2 and 
3.4 bars.  
5.3.2 Choice of small valve lift duration 
To make a comparison of how the small valve lift duration shall be chosen depending 
on engine speed at different loads, when using the Major lift strategy, a total of 20 
cases were simulated, at engine speeds from 500 to 2000 rpm and intake pressures 
from 3 bar to 5 bar. All cases were run with the Major lift strategy even though it was 
proven in chapter 5.3.1 that the most appropriate valve timing strategy at 500 rpm and 
5 bar of absolute intake pressure was the Minor lift strategy. In all cases, the major lift 
was limited to open at 140 CAD and to close at 360 CAD, i.e. 220 CAD duration. 
27 
Figure 28 and 29 show the duration for the EGR-valve and the exhaust valve needed 
to transfer 50 % EGR when using the Major lift strategy at 3.0 bar absolute intake 
pressure at different engine speeds. In this case the intake pressure exceeds the 
exhaust pressure of 2.76 bar, which leads to that the exhaust valve will limit the 
amount of EGR. As the intake pressure is higher than the exhaust pressure, a major 
lift with the EGR-valve is made. The turbo efficiency used was 60 % and the EGR-
rate was 50 %.

The figures show that a longer duration of the exhaust valve is needed when the 
engine speed increases. At this load though, the pressure difference is just 0.25 bar 
and phenomena such as pressure pulses may affect the result which explains why the 
exhaust valve duration at 2000 rpm is slightly shorter than at 1000 and 1500 rpm. 
 
Figures 30 and 31 show the duration for the EGR-valve and the exhaust valve at a 
higher intake pressure of 5.0 bar. Here it is shown that at higher engine speeds, the 
EGR-limiting EGR-valve must be given a longer duration than at lower engine 
speeds. At 2000 rpm though, the major lift has to be made with the EGR-valve. The 
reason for this is unknown, but never the less the duration of the EGR-valve has to be 
increased compared to lower engine speeds.

The reason for the longer duration that is needed with the EGR-limiting valve at 
higher engine speeds is that the cylinder pressure is higher in the beginning and the 
end of the exhaust stroke at higher engine speeds. When the major lift valve is open 
and the small lift valve is closed in the beginning of the exhaust stroke a higher mass 
flow is received through the major lift valve at higher engine speeds. This leads to that 
a longer duration with the small lift valve is needed. 
28 
5.3.3 Engine test conformity 
The engine was run at different engine speeds, but with the same λ, EGR-rate, intake 
temperature, intake pressure and exhaust pressure. The valve timing was then altered 
to achieve close to the same EGR-rate. This way the speed dependency on the valve 
timing to reach the same EGR-rate could be analyzed and also verify the simulations 
made in GT-Power. 
 
As can be seen in table 8 and figure 32, when the engine speed is increased the EVO 
must be moved earlier to reach the same EGR-rate. The simulations in GT-power 
show the same behaviour, however the resulting EGR-rate is not the same as in the 
engine test, it differs around 7 %. In some cases the GT-Power model has been found 
to differ more from the engine tests than in other cases. This is one of these cases and 
better conformity has been achieved in other cases.

Figure 32 Measured vs simulated EGR rate at 750 rpm and 1000 rpm 
 
The difference in EGR-rate between the engine tests and the simulations is partly due 
to the fact that the AVT-system could not perfectly follow the theoretical valve lift 
curves that are simulated in GT-Power. Thus the valve lifts are phased slightly later 
and thereby the EGR-rate is affected. A sensitivity test at 750 rpm where EVO for the 
exhaust valve was placed 5 CAD later resulted in approximately 5 % higher EGR-
rate. This means valve timing is crucial in this case. 
 
29 
Another source of error could be that the EGR-rate is measured with a Horiba exhaust 
gas analyzer which is slow; hence it might be a possibility that the measured EGR-
rate was not fully stabilized. 
30 
6 Comparison of D-EGR and external EGR 
Comparisons of the D-EGR-system and the external EGR-system were done at 
different loads and engine speeds. All simulations presented below were made at 
λ=1.2 with a turbo efficiency of 60 % and an EGR-rate of 50 %. 
 
Figure 33 shows the total engine efficiency at 500 rpm at different intake pressures. 
As can be seen the D-EGR-system becomes more effective in comparison with the 
external EGR-system as the intake pressure rises. This is an effect of the pressure 
difference between intake- and exhaust pressure, which is shown in table 9. When the 
exhaust pressure exceeds the intake pressure, it is beneficial to make a part of the 
exhaust stroke towards the lower intake pressure.

Figure 33 Comparison of total engine efficiency at 500 rpm 
 
The comparisons between the systems at higher engine speeds are shown in figures 34 
to 36 and have some differences compared to 500 rpm. One can see that the D-EGR 
system reaches efficiency of the external EGR only at very high intake pressures at 
1000 rpm and 2000 rpm in figure 34 and 36. At 1500 rpm there is a significant 
31 
increase in efficiency with the D-EGR-system, which probably is caused by 
favourable pressure pulsations. 
 
If the results at 1500 rpm are disregarded from, one can see a trend where the D-EGR-
system is more effective at lower engine speeds when compared to the external EGR-
system. This is because of the increasing pumping losses at higher engine speeds, due 
to the increasing engine mass flow.

A comparison with an ordinary EGR-system should be more favourable for the D-
EGR-system, because an ordinary EGR-system needs a venturi, or some other device, 
to admit EGR to be transferred into the intake system when the intake pressure 
exceeds the exhaust pressure. This will lead to an increase in pumping losses 
compared to the external EGR-system used in these simulations.

7 Results from tests with D-EGR 
7.1 Phasing of CA50 
Shown in figure 37 is the measured cylinder pressure with an early IVC at 595 CAD, 
and a late IVC at 610 CAD. This engine test was performed with the EGR-valve 
closed and thereby no incoming EGR. A slight performance improvement would 
probably be achieved if both exhaust valves were used to get rid of exhaust gases. 
 
A late IVC gives the effect that the compression starts later as the intake valves must 
be closed to start the compression. Thus a late IVC equals to a reduction of the useful 
compression stroke. As the compression starts later the combustion also begins later 
and for that reason the CA50 is phased later.

In figure 38 the measured cylinder pressure is shown with a fixed IVC at 570 CAD, 
but with different EGR-rates. As can be seen the same effect as changing the IVC can 
be achieved by using EGR. As explained earlier, an increase in EGR gives a later start 
of combustion and increased combustion duration, hence a later phased CA50. In this 
case a 1.9 % increase in EGR-rate resulted in phasing CA50 from 7.3 CAD to 9.4 
CAD. A benefit of using EGR to delay the combustion is that the IVC can be moved 
towards the point where the engine reaches its maximum volumetric efficiency.  
 
The most interesting fact when using EGR however is that with an increasing EGR-
rate, the injected amount of fuel can also be increased considerably. The more fuel 
that can be injected into the engine the more power it will produce; hence the power 
34 
density of the engine can be increased quite a bit when using EGR. Without EGR an 
IMEP of 8.65 bar was achieved at IVC=595 CAD as can be seen in figure 37, but 
with 42 % EGR the IMEP increased to 11.05 bar as is shown in figure 38. 
 
It can be expected that the engine quite possibly could run at air/fuel mixtures down to 
λ=1 with large EGR-rates. Thus the engine should be able to produce decent power. 
However, due to the possibility that the engine may fail, engine tests as tough as this 
have not been performed, but air/fuel mixtures down to λ=1.4 have been tested.

7.2 Transient behaviour with D-EGR 
To examine how fast the D-EGR-system is, the engine was run during a transient 
where the EVO was moved 6 CAD to change the resulting EGR-rate. Engine 
operating conditions, valve timing and resulting CA50 and EGR-rate is shown in table 
10 to 12.

Figure 39 shows the transient behaviour of the HCCI-engine with D-EGR, where the 
CA50 and EVO is shown as a function of time. A late EVO results in more EGR, so 
the CA50 is delayed, and obviously an earlier EVO results in less EGR, thus earlier 
CA50.

The EGR-system seems to be quite fast, but to give a better view the first transient has 
been zoomed in and is shown in figure 40. The figure shows that it takes around 1.5 
seconds for the engine to stabilize after CA50 starts to decrease. This equals 12 cycles 
since the engine is run at 1000 rpm.

7.3 Simulated transient behaviour with D-EGR 
Transient simulations were carried out for the standard D-EGR-system, a shortened 
D-EGR-system and the shortened D-EGR-system with the mixture point moved 
closer to the intake manifold. The standard D-EGR-system has a length of 2.1 meters, 
measured from the EGR-valve to the intake mixture point, and the short D-EGR-
system has a length of 1.0 meters. The short D-EGR with moved mixture point is built 
as the short D-EGR-system except that the intake mixture point is moved 0.51 meters 
closer to the intake manifold. 
 
During simulation, the engine was run for 5 seconds and then the valve timing was 
altered to achieve a different EGR-rate and finally the engine was run for another 5 
seconds. The reason for this was to make sure that the engine reached a stable running 
condition before valve timing was altered. 
 
In theory the shorter D-EGR-system should provide a faster transient response in 
respect to the resulting EGR-rate in the cylinder, because of the smaller volume 
trapped in the shorter tubing. A moved mixture point should also improve the 
response of the resulting EGR-rate in the cylinder. The task of these simulations was 
to verify these theories. 
 
Several transient simulations were made with a resulting EGR-rate difference starting 
from 4 % up to approximately 30 %. When transients with little difference in the 
resulting EGR-rate where simulated, there was almost no visible difference in 
response time. Hence simulations with greater change in EGR-rates were simulated. 
 
The engine was simulated with the following parameters fixed, see table 13. The 
valve timing of the exhaust valve had to be slightly adjusted to get close to the same 
resulting EGR-rate in both models, which is shown in table 14.

Figure 41 shows the EGR-rate as function of time. GT-Power is told to alter the valve 
timing at t=5 seconds. This is however in the end of a cycle, which means that GT-
Power will not note the change in valve timing until the start of the next cycle which 
is at t=5.04 seconds. The resulting EGR-rate does not begin to fall though until the 
next cycle at t=5.16 second. Thus the EGR-rate starts to fall in the cycle after the 
valve timing is altered.

Figure 41 Simulated transient behaviour with different lengths of the D-EGR-system 
 
Taking a close look at the figure one can see that it actually shows a slight 
improvement in respect of time with the short D-EGR-system. However, the 
improvement is not by any means big and it seems somewhat unrealistic to reduce the 
D-EGR-system much more in length as it already is reduced quite close to what 
should be possible in reality. When the intake point is moved closer to the intake 
manifold though, the response time is shortened considerably. 
 
Thus the length of the D-EGR-system does not seem to affect the transient response 
very much. The placement of the intake mixture point though, seems to have a greater 
affect on the transient response, hence it should be placed as close as possible to the 
intake manifold. 
38 
8 Recommendations for continued work 
To verify and improve the GT-Power model further, more engine tests should be 
performed at important loads and engine speeds.  
 
Simulations should be made with further tests of the Minor lift strategy with different 
lengths of the overlap between the EGR-valve and the exhaust valve to determine the 
efficiency of the strategy at different loads. The combustion model could also be 
improved when it comes to simulating start of combustion and combustion duration. 
 
One could also investigate how to choose valve diameters of the EGR-valve and the 
exhaust valve to improve the brake efficiency of the engine. At high load with higher 
exhaust pressure than intake pressure, it could perhaps be beneficial to have a larger 
exhaust valve and a corresponding smaller EGR-valve. 
 
A control system that can handle static as well as dynamic situations would also be of 
interest. This is quite probably a difficult task to achieve, especially during fast 
transients such as when one wants to go from low load to high load instantly. In such 
cases the engine should respond instantly without hesitation. 
 
There are also some things that should be improved with the KTH test bed. One thing 
would be to get a working regulator for the PWM-valve that controls the water flow 
and thus the temperature of the EGR. During our engine tests the valve was controlled 
manually to reach 60°C temperature of the EGR after the EGR-cooler. A PID-
regulator should be relatively easy to set up, and would be handy.  
 
Another problem is the valve in the exhaust system which controls the exhaust back 
pressure. This valve proved to be too leaky to build up big enough back pressure and 
therefore it should be replaced. 
 
The AVT-system picked up disturbances every now and then, causing the system to 
crash. A solution for this would for sure be of interest for the people that will go on 
working with this engine. 
39 
9 Conclusions 
The D-EGR-system works as expected; an introduction of cooled EGR indeed phases 
the combustion later and increases the combustion duration. The main benefit of the 
cooled EGR is that with an increasing EGR-rate, the amount of fuel being injected can 
also be increased without reaching excessive cylinder pressure and pressure rise. 
Hence the HCCI-engine can produce decent power levels with D-EGR. The system 
also has the ability to transfer EGR to the intake at all times during operation no 
matter what the pressure difference between intake and exhaust is. 
 
Two valve timing strategies were introduced; the Major lift strategy and the Minor lift 
strategy. In general the Major lift strategy should be used at low pressure differences 
between the EGR-valve and the exhaust valve, as the flow losses are reduced in 
comparison with the Minor lift strategy. At high pressure differences the Minor lift 
strategy should be used to prevent the mass flow from getting negative during overlap 
between the EGR-valve and the exhaust valve. 
 
In terms of engine efficiency the D-EGR-system provides quite good performance, 
especially at high load and low engine speeds. However at high engine speeds, the 
flow losses increase which will decrease the efficiency of the engine, and at low load 
the intake pressure may exceed the exhaust pressure, which makes it unbeneficial to 
do a part of the exhaust stroke with the EGR-valve towards the intake pressure. 
 
An interesting fact is that the D-EGR-system can provide a fast change in EGR-rate 
which has been verified by simulations and engine tests. Thus it can handle transients 
well.
