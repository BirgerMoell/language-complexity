Abstract 
This case study was conducted in collaboration with Scania CV and the Outbound Logistics 
group in Zwolle, The Netherlands. 
Scania is a leading global manufacturer of heavy trucks and buses. With steadily increasing 
production volumes, more space is required on the factory yard for ready chassis waiting to be 
picked up by the carriers in the outbound delivery process. The purpose of this study was to 
investigate and propose a new working method to increase the turnover rate of the ready stock in 
Zwolle. This led to questions about how the outbound logistics is planned in Zwolle today, and 
how it can be planned in the future with increased production volumes.  
The study was limited to cover chassis for direct delivery markets in Europe. 
First to get a holistic overview of the conditions, a mapping of the current situation was 
conducted. The mapping included pilot studies, visits to Zwolle to perform observations, and 
interviews of people involved in the outbound logistic process in Zwolle. In parallel with the 
above activities, a lot of statistics has been processed to be able to evaluate the staff’s perception 
of the situation. In order to make a fair interpretation of the collected data, the author has found 
support in various theories. 
The mapping, evaluation of statistics and literature review have helped the author to identify 
areas for implementation that may increase the turnover rate of the ready stock in Zwolle. The 
results show the importance of obtaining a true picture of the current situation, in order to 
identify possible actions in the change management. The results also show how the delivery 
group can plan their stock of ready chassis in a more efficient manner.

Sammanfattning 
Denna fallstudie genomfördes i samarbete med Scania CV och Outbound Logistics-gruppen i 
Zwolle, Nederländerna. 
Scania är en av världens ledande tillverkare av tunga lastbilar och bussar. Med stadigt ökande 
produktionsvolymer, krävs mer utrymme på fabriksgården för färdiga chassis i väntan på att 
plockas upp av transportörerna i den utgående leveransprocessen. Syftet med denna studie var att 
undersöka och föreslå en ny arbetsmetod för att öka omsättningshastigheten av färdiglager i 
Zwolle. Detta ledde till frågor om hur den utgående logistiken är planerad i Zwolle i dag? Och 
hur den kan planeras i framtiden med ökade produktionsvolymer? 
 
Studien begränsades till att omfatta chassi för direktleveransmarknader i Europa. 
 
Först för att få en helhetssyn av villkoren, genomfördes en kartläggning av nuläget. I 
kartläggningen ingick pilotstudier, besök i Zwolle för att utföra observationer och intervjuer av 
personer som är involverade i den utgående logistikprocessen i Zwolle. Parallellt med 
ovanstående aktiviteter, har en hel del statistik bearbetats för att samtidigt kunna utvärdera 
personalens uppfattning av situationen. För att kunna göra en rättvis tolkning av insamlade data, 
har författaren funnit stöd i olika teorier. 
 
Kartläggningen, utvärdering av statistik och litteraturstudier har hjälpt författaren att identifiera 
områden som kan utvecklas för att öka omsättningshastigheten av färdiglagret i Zwolle. 
Resultaten visar att det är viktigt att först få en sann bild av den nuvarande situationen, i syfte att 
identifiera möjliga åtgärder i ett förändringsarbete. Resultaten visar också hur leveransgruppen 
kan planera sitt lager av färdiga chassis på ett mer effektivt sätt.

Preamble 
To do this assignment, and to write this report has been a task that hasn’t been obvious. My 
studies in applied logistics started already in 2003, and after completing the theory section, I 
began my working career as engineer. It seemed, if anything, only good to combine work with a 
completion of the thesis. For various reasons it has taken some time. 
 
Now that the assignment is nearing its end it feels somewhat surreal to me that anytime now, in 
end of May or early June I will actually be finished with the whole of my master's program.  
Although I have been working hard with this master thesis, I'm not going to take all the credit. I 
have had a battery of wise people to support me. Without these dedicated people I had not been 
able to complete this assignment.  
 
I would like to thank AnnaCarin Lindgren, who has been the one indicating that this master 
thesis was within reach. She was the one that enabled me to use part of my operational work to 
perform this study.  
I would like to thank Hans Ekman, Manager at Global Outbound Logistics in Södertälje, who 
had an interesting and reasonably comprehensive assignment “saved” for me. 
I would like to give many thanks to Zwolle Outbound Logistics group. Hillebrand Diever 
(Manager) and Dick Nijsink with colleagues have given me all possible support with my 
questions and issues. They have with a large portion of  patience shown me throughout Zwolle 
factory and have been engaged and available in the study.  
Two special thanks go to my supervisors, Magnus Pettersson (Scania), and Lars-Åke Arvidsson 
(KTH), who helped me to control all the work toward completion.  
The greatest thanks I want to give my husband, he has given me the biggest support in everyday 
life, and have strengthen my ability to make it all the way.  
 
With all the above kind of support, I have now been able to complete my studies at the KTH 
Royal Institute of Technology.

1  INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background 
Today Scania is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of heavy trucks and buses. Scania has 
customers in a wide range of markets and various areas of functions. Scania’s production units 
are located in Europe and Latin America. The main production facilities in Europe are Södertälje 
(Sweden), Zwolle (Netherlands) and Angers (France).     
Scania’s customer is dependent on the fact that Scania delivers on time, since uptime is 
everything for the user of a truck. Every day and every hour that the client idles can be translated 
to a loss of income in the business, which is why it’s very important that the deliveries are 
executed within the agreements. 
Every risk of a customer getting a truck late is a failure for Scania, and will eventually give 
negative consequences. To have this risk minimized at the same time as Scania has steadily 
increasing production volumes is crucial.  
When producing the trucks, after the final assembly line, the ready stock of chassis is placed on 
the outdoor factory yard, while waiting to be picked up by the carriers in the outbound transport 
process. At some of Scania’s final assembly plants the yard space is very limited. Due to this, 
Scania need to find other solutions to handle the ready stock.  
1.2 Objective 
The object of this study is to investigate and propose a working method for Scania and the 
carriers in order to have the chassis picked up as soon as they are released from production but 
still deliver them on time, not too early nor too late. 
This will include investigations in regards to;  
 
 How is the ready stock and outbound logistics designed today? 
 How can Scania design their outbound logistics in the future, to increase the turnover rate on 
ready stock of chassis in Zwolle, without adding any cost per chassis? 
 Is it possible to have chassis picked up within 12 hours after being released from production? 
1.3 Limitations 
This study will focus on areas within Scania’s range of responsibility, in regards of ready stock 
and outbound transportations.  
The study will touch areas in close relation to some of Scania’s carriers but it will not include 
comprehensive studies for any specific carrier.

2  BASELINE 
2.1 Scania as a Company 
Scania was founded in 1891 in Södertälje, Sweden, and the company head office is still in the 
city (Scania homepage). The company have approximately 37,500 employees around the world.  
 
Scania is a global company with a sales and service organization in more than 100 countries. 
Scania provides the markets with heavy trucks and buses. Industrial and Marine Engines is 
another important business area. Since the company was founded, they have built and delivered 
more than 1,400,000 trucks and buses for heavy transport work (Scania homepage). 
 
 
Figure 2.1 Worldwide production sites (Scania.com 2014) 
 
 
Scania’s core values permeate its entire corporate culture and influence its day-to-day work. 
Customer first, respect for the individual and quality are closely linked and are applied as a 
unified concept.  
 
Each and every Scania truck is unique. There are a range of choices that has to be made by the 
customer when ordering, for instance a new truck. Scania has a strong production focus, and the 
planning for each chassis/individual starts immediately when the customer places the order. 
Scania manufactured roughly 75 000 truck chassis during 2013(Scania annual report 2013). 
2.2 Outbound Logistics in Zwolle 
The global outbound logistics organization consists of the partners at Scania who are involved in 
the final shipment of Scania's chassis. The organization is divided into two main functions, one 
operational function and one function responsible for the process development.  
The operational functions in Europe is called the delivery functions and are located at Scania's 
three final assembly plants in Södertälje, Zwolle and Angers. 
 
- 4 - 
 
 
 
Figure 2.2 Global outbound organization (Created by the author) 
 
 
These separate functions are responsible for various daily operations such as transport booking, 
document handling and handover of keys to the carriers. Additionally, there is a function called 
Global Outbound Logistics, that is located in Södertälje.  
This function, in Södertälje, is responsible for development of processes, routines and standards 
and decides and sets the processes accordingly.  
 
The organizational chart in the figure is a bit adjusted. Except for the outbound logistics in 
Europe, there is an outbound logistics function in Latin America as well. Since it is not part of 
this case study, I haven't included it to this description either. 
 
From the different production sites the chassis is then transported by contracted carriers, who are 
responsible for the delivery to their markets.  
The chassis is delivered to a dealer or to a bodybuilder. The bodybuilders mount for instance 
tipper, crane or a box to the chassis. After this is done, additional work is often done in a 
workshop. Then, the truck arrives again at the dealer who then ultimately delivers the truck to 
the end customer.

3  METHOD 
3.1 Strategy  
When conducting a survey or a research project it will require use of some strategy or method. 
The method can be seen as a tool or instrument. One of these tools is the approach you use to 
find answers and also gain new knowledge within an area (Larsen, 2009). To pursue science, it’s 
important to select and apply the method with great awareness. The same is valid for how to 
select and use the tools. Each method can be modified in various ways (Ejvegård, 2003). 
3.2 Qualitative and Quantitative Method  
Data collected can be qualitative or quantitative. Qualitative data requires analysis based on 
sorting and categorization, while quantitative data consists of words and descriptions, and are 
rich in details and nuances (Autumn, Regnell & Runeson, 2006). Which method you choose to 
use in the investigation, can according to Larsen (2009) be determined by looking at the 
following factors; 
 
 Research question 
How the question is phrased determines the choice of method. If you want to find out 
people's opinions then quantitative methods is often used, such as questionnaire. If you 
instead want to know something about attitudes, a qualitative method fit best, for instance 
depth interview. 
 
 Purpose with the study 
If you want to get a general understanding of individual phenomena qualitative methods are 
best suited. If you, however, want to get a representative overview you should use 
quantitative methods. The meaning of a representative study is that the results are valid for 
more than they actually investigated. 
 
 Own abilities and resources 
Before committing to a particular method you also need to ask yourself: What methods do I 
master? How much time and money do I have? Some methods are more resource intensive 
than others. 
 
 The researcher relation to the sources 
In the end, this is also about proximity and distance. Qualitative methods involves meeting 
informants face to face. Is this possible or even desirable? 
 
3.3 Advantages and Disadvantages of Quantitative Method  
One of the advantages of using the quantitative method is that you can use advanced processing 
methods, such as computer-based program for statistical analysis of the material. This is labor-
saving and tables and figures often provide a good summary of the results. Then, on the other 
hand there are disadvantages to quantitative methods as well. One is that there could be a lack of 
precision in data processing when the numerical material is comprehensive. There is a risk that 
this in the end will lead to wrong conclusions. Precision is important for the investigation in 
regards to reliability (Larsen, 2009). 
- 6 - 
 
 
3.4 Advantages and Disadvantages of Qualitative Method  
In qualitative studies you will meet the informants face to face, which is an advantage as it 
minimizes the loss. Another big advantage is that during the interview, you may ask 
supplementary questions and get additional answers. It gives a better position to understand the 
whole picture of the phenomenon you are investigating. An important aspect is that it is easier to 
ensure good validity in qualitative research. The interviewee can talk freely and you can 
regularly ask for explanations. One of the disadvantages of qualitative methods is that it is harder 
and more time consuming to process data that have no pre-defined response categories. Another 
down side is that you can’t generalize from out of the qualitative studies (Larsen, 2009). 
3.5 Methodological Triangulation 
Often methods that contain elements of both quantitative and qualitative methods, so-called, 
method triangulation are used. This could include comparing results from interviewees, 
observations and document analysis to see if similar results are being found. If the conclusions 
from each of the methods are the same, then validity is established (Guion, Diehl & McDonald, 
2002). Yin (2012) also supports the advantage of using both quantitative and qualitative methods 
in parallel. ”Case study data collection - should include both qualitative (non-numeric or 
categorical) and quantitative (numeric) data” (Yin, 2012 - p.11) 
3.6 Case Study 
Höst et al. (2006), argues that a case study describes a specific case for which you usually selects 
with a specific purpose in mind, and you will not try to claim that the findings from this case is 
directly generalisable to other cases. On the other hand, if you have two cases that have similar 
conditions, the probability is of course high that the conclusions will be the same in both.  
 
Yin (2007), states that you should use the case study when you want to address cases where the 
contextual conditions are of high relevance for what you are about to study. Further, he argues 
that the case study is like other research methods a  way to study empirically theme by following 
a set of procedures that have been specified in advance. Adding up, the case study is a 
comprehensive approach that includes a logic design, techniques for collecting data and a 
specific approach for the analysis of the data (Yin, 2007).  
 
One of the purposes of using the case study method is that you in a limited space can give the 
reader an idea of how things interrelate. The difficulty is that a single case study never fully 
represent reality. Therefore you should be cautious with the conclusions you make. Ejvegård 
(2003), argues that in the early stage of a case study, it aims to understand something rather than 
explaining anything.  
 
The table below shows a simplified model of how to do in order to identify the most appropriate 
method for the question in mind. 
 
 
 
 
- 7 - 
 
Table 3.1: Relevant situations when using the different research methods (Yin, 2007) 
 
 
The case study method is selected with support from the table above, due to the fact that the 
author first of all need to map and understand the current process for ready stock, and how it’s 
managed today. The case study will give opportunity for the author to understand how the 
carriers are involved and their responsibilities.  
 
The next phase of the study, is to examine how small things in the process affects the whole 
picture. Together this will give a good baseline to develop a proposal for how Scania can 
continue to develop within their global outbound logistics. 
  
Double checking with the table the research question has focus on present time (events), and 
does not require control over the informant.  
3.7 Design 
There are five components that are extra significant when doing a research design (Yin, 2007): 
 the research questions, 
 its hypotheses (if there are any), 
 its analysis units, 
 the logical connection between data and hypotheses, 
 criteria for the interpretation of the results 
 
The first bullet, regarding the type of research question has already been clarified, in the above 
section.  
If the study doesn’t have any hypotheses (bullet two), it requires a clear purpose (objective) and 
furthermore you need to decide what criteria that are in question when evaluating if the study has 
been successful or not. 
The analysis units are connected to the underlying problem, the analysis units helps you to define 
the “case” and what it’s all about. To identify the specific analysis units for this study, the author 
have used a model developed by Ph.D Yin. The identification starts with selecting one of four 
types of design  
- 8 - 
 
 
Figure 3.1: Basic types of design for case studies (Yin, 2007) 
 
 
 
1. Single or multiple case study? 
2. Holistic or embedded sub cases? 
3. How many cases in multiple case studies? There is no definitive answer, however the 
more cases, the greater confidence in your findings. 
With the above three question you are able to find your own type of case study design. 
  
From out of how the research question is phrased, together with the model above it’s reasonable 
to categorized the study as a single-case design.  
The case study is made with two embedded units to analyze. The analysis units are Ready stock 
and Carriers.  
The context is Scania organization, Zwolle. 
The case is Scania outbound logistics.  
.

3.8 Criteria for Quality Evaluation of the Research Design 
Since a research design is assumed to represent a logical set of statements, one can also assess 
the quality of a given research design based on some logical criteria. The most frequent criteria 
when evaluating an empirical study are according to Yin (2007) these four: 
 Concept validity – regards the design of proper operational measures for the concepts 
being studied. 
 Internal validity – regards the question of the extent to which one's results are consistent 
with the reality (Merriam, 1994). 
 External validity – regards the problem to know if the results of a study can be 
generalized beyond the current case study. 
 Reliability – regards the extent to which one's results can be repeated (Merriam, 1994). 
3.9 Theory and the Relation between Theory and Empirics 
Traditionally, theory can be described as a system of assumptions or statements that describe the 
part of the reality that is object for the study. A theory should form a coherent entirety from 
which we can explain or understand as large amount of existing information about the studied 
object as possible (Patel, Davidson, 2003). Theory is the logical connection between data and 
hypotheses.  
 
Figure 3.2: Relation between theory and reality (Patel & Davidson, 2003) 
 
3.10 Execution 
To perform this case study, the researcher have visited and interviewed several persons in 
different positions. The informants are chosen persons that are very experienced in their role, and 
have deep understanding about the operative work. 
To keep a broad perspective, all interviews are performed  in an unstructured way (see 9.4 for 
respondents). This technique involves direct interaction between the researcher and a respondent 
or group, since you only have some initial guiding questions or core concepts to ask about, there 
is no formal structured instrument or protocol. The positive thing with this is that it gives you 
- 10 - 
 
freedom to move the conversation in any direction of interest that may come up. But it has a 
downside to: Because each interview tends to be unique with no predetermined set of questions 
asked of all respondents, it’s usually more difficult to analyze unstructured interview data. To 
ease the analysis, In this case study there has been lot of documents and material to lean against, 
that is to be seen as secondary data. It has been good to read, read again and discuss with the 
respondent and really understand the whole chain of activities.  
 
To first obtain a holistic picture of the situation, and later on also perform the analyze, secondary 
data in terms of statistics, have been processed. All interviews have been performed face-to-face, 
where the actual operational work is done, and is to be seen as primary data.  
 
The interviews have required some travelling, and to get the most out of the travelling, and the 
meeting with persons, the interviews have been preceded by two directed pilot studies. The first 
pilot was prior to travelling to Zwolle, with purpose to meet the Outbound Logistics group. The 
second pilot was performed with purpose to meet a specific carrier located in Austria. Both pilots 
had the purpose of giving the researcher a better understanding of the working environments. 
The decision for using pilot studies was to find ideas and a clear framework for what questions to 
ask live. As these pilots, first of all, had an exploratory character, there were no problems 
whatsoever with getting honest and in-depth answers from the respondents in question. The 
pilots were also selected based on their geographic locations, and it was significant to collect 
plenty of useful information.  
 
Literature studies have been conducted continuously during the study (see 9.1 in Sources). 
This has worked as guidance to identify and clarify which areas that are a problem today, and 
also a guidance for what to improve and what actions that could be taken in future work. 
3.11 Quality of the Study 
Since this study is performed by me alone, and with a limited time frame, one could give 
criticism of how deep and elaborated this study really is. Due to the fact that the study risks to be 
seen as a work that only scratches the surface, I have worked with several sources in parallel. I 
have worked broad, with both qualitative, and quantitative method, to give the study a high 
validity and reliability. 
Validity 
The methods used in the study can be considered to have generated results of high validity.  
Case study as the chosen method provides a design that gives an insurance that the specific case 
also was intended to study. All empirical collection of data are made through triangulation, both 
in regards to interviews (with multiple respondents ), and other data, such as statistics and 
documentation. The result has then been discussed with the expert respondents, which with their 
long experience in the operational work, reduces the risk of misunderstanding the data or make 
subjective assumptions. 
 
To further strengthen the respondents' answers, review of existing Scania Internal documentation 
is done in parallel. Case study according to Yin (2012), are not generalizable beyond the current 
case study. Yin (2012), also states that two cases, with similar conditions, has high probability 
that the conclusion is the same in both cases. The study is to be considered as generalizable, but 
only within organizations with the same type of problem.

Reliability 
Consistency between the interview data and documented data in the study can be considered to 
have generated results of high reliability.  
 
For a researcher to be able to repeat an earlier case study, it’s according to Yin (2002), important 
that the approach for the case study has been documented as concrete as possible. Yin (2002) 
point out for instance the importance of creating a database of collected material with the 
purpose to strengthen the study's reliability. 
All collected data (empirical collection), has been saved for possible future examination. All 
interview data is documented as well. 
 
The study was limited for Zwolle outbound logistics, and with more time and resources one 
could have done some benchmarking with Södertälje, and Angers outbound logistics. The same 
reasoning goes for the carriers in question. One carrier, even though it has large volume to 
transport from Zwolle, is a bit thin substratum to rely on. The performed interviews have been 
compared with other written material, and to what I have had the chance to observe myself.

4  THEORY 
4.1 Process Focus 
4.1.1 Utility with Processes 
The traditional way to organize manufacturing and distribution company can be described as 
functions with separated duties and responsibilities. Individuals and departments are expected to 
perform distinct and specialized tasks. Collaboration between departments is often done via 
some form of department managers. The basic principle behind this form of organization is the 
assumption that you become more efficient through specialization. However, it is not obvious at 
all according to Mattsson (2002), that a number of individually effective departments together 
constitute an efficient company.  
 
Each organization has certain activities that are repeated in time, while other activities are more 
of unique character. The repeated activities is called processes and its prime purpose is to create 
value to either an internal or external customer. The process thinking is a vital part for the 
modern leadership and is required from a quality perspective. The processes appear most often as 
cross-functional flows of sub-processes that bridge the gap between organizations' functional 
units. The process perspective is based on the overall picture of the workflows in the 
organization and focuses on the cross-functional flow rather than on functions. The process 
perspective gives awareness about the customer, product , information flow and required 
resources, and shows clearly the organization's effectiveness. Process management is meant to 
use when to organize, understand , manage and continuously improve processes. It's crucial to 
have a holistic approach when improving processes, as small changes in a process can give big 
changes in another process  (Lumsden, 1998). 
 
4.1.2 Change Management  
The foundation to successful change management is that you know where the company stands 
today. Knowledge about the present processes is a prerequisite to evaluate if an alternative 
solution will lead to an improvement (Aronsson, Ekdahl & Oskarsson, 2003). 
 
The most important, when performing your change management, is perhaps not which model 
you chose, but that you will find a carefully planned and structured way of working. The picture 
below shows a structure Aronsson et al (2003) has developed.  
 
Different tools focus on different steps in the model. For instance the flow mapping is used to 
describe the current situation, inventory management tool for finding alternative solutions and 
total cost analysis to compare the different options. The common denominator is that none of 
them can be used alone if you want to perform a change management. All of the steps are needed 
to achieve a successful change. 
- 14 - 
 
 
Figure 4.1: Change management (Aronsson et al, 2003) 
 
1. The first step is to clarify the conditions for the change management. What are the 
objectives in regards to costs and lead time? What parts of the company are concerned? 
What resources are available? All these types of questions need to be clarified. 
2. Step two is to describe and analyze the current situation. The first part in that is to 
perform a flow mapping that principally shows the current material and information flow. 
Then to be able to analyze the baseline you have to quantify the flow. This is done by 
creating flow-related and financial KPI (Key Performance Indicators). 
3. In the next step, step three you develop suggestions for alternative solutions, this means 
other way of organizing and steer the business. 
 
In the above picture, step two and step three are positioned next to each other. Due to the 
 
fact that these two steps are often performed in parallel. 
   
4. The fourth step is to compare the current situation with alternative proposals. This is done 
by predicting how the new proposals will work and by that create the same KPIs as for 
the baseline. Now you are able to compare the different proposals with the current 
situation to find pros and cons for each alternative. 
5. With the above analyze, it’s time to select one solution. In addition to the KPIs 
mentioned above, more soft values can have an affect on the decision. You might, for 
instance, take into consideration whether a certain solution is in line with the company’s 
overall strategies, and if it’s hard to implement in reality. 
6. In step six it’s time to implement the change. This means to change the organization and 
routines the new way it has been decided upon. This is hard and time consuming work. It 
- 15 - 
 
doesn’t matter how good the suggestion solution is if you don’t succeed with 
implementing it.  
7. The last step of the change management is to perform follow-up on the results. When the 
changes are implemented you need to evaluate how well the new solution works.    
Aronsson et al (2003) claims that since the time often is very limited, it’s important to 
concentrate the work where it gives the most effect. To avoid spending resources on the wrong 
things one should therefore gradually refine the parts of the flow that is most interesting.  
  
4.2 Planning and Stock Control 
Logistics is an area where the whole picture needs to be in focus. For theories and concepts to be 
realized, it requires a really good  knowledge about how things are done on an operational level. 
All the logistics work must be based on knowledge in the operational elements, just as the 
operational elements must be developed from a holistic point of view. (Aronsson et al, 2003). 
 
4.2.1 The Idea with Outbound Logistics 
The activities that form the supply chain process vary from company to company, depending on 
the company in questions organizational structure, the management perception of the supply 
chain scope of the company and the importance of individual activities to its operations (Lai & 
Cheng, 2009).  
According to Lai and Cheng (2009), Ballou (2004) viewed that there are two aspects of logistics 
activities in a company’s immediate supply chain, it’s inbound logistics (material management) 
and  it’s outbound logistics (physical distribution). The thrust of inbound logistics is to satisfy 
the operations needs of the manufacturing and service operations line. Outbound logistics is the 
flip side of inbound logistics, dealing with the movement, storage and processing of orders for a 
company’s outputs. The main activities are primarily concerned with finished and semi finished 
products, and for which the company plans no further processing. 
 
The objective of outbound logistics  is to minimize the cost involved in physically moving and 
storing the items from the point of production to the point where they are delivered. Further Lai 
and Cheng (2009), claim that except for purchasing, the logistics activities that defines inbound 
and outbound logistics are very similar. And that the ultimate goal is to integrate and coordinate 
all the organizational actors in material management and physical distribution in such a way that 
the end markets are served in the most cost-effective manner.  
 
4.2.2 Strategies and Internal Planning 
The company's goal is determined by overall strategic goal and long term planning. The basic 
work to formulate and develop a logistics strategy originates from the strategy of the company. 
Logistics goal is to achieve high delivery service and low costs. To be able to achieve that, 
companies with many different decisions, made by many different people  need to work with 
planning in a structured way. With the strategy as a base, another set of decisions needs to be 
taken and this is done as part of the planning. A distinction is made for the strategic, tactical and 
operational planning. The focus of the planning should originate from how the company wants 
the products to move, what activities to be performed and the order in which this should be done 
through the logistics channel (Aronsson et al, 2003). 
 
4.2.3 Utility of Inventory  
Motive for building inventory, or ready stock, is varying. Which also affects the character of the 
stock. One of the most important reasons for having stock is to ensure that the manufacturing 
- 16 - 
 
process between inbound and outbound in the company is freed from interference. To have stock 
itself isn’t bad, provided that the size is dimensioned from out of decided needs and criteria’s. 
The goal for a manufacturing company is to effectively satisfy customer requirements. However, 
in general, one should always try to keep the inventories low. All forms of stock must sometimes 
be questioned. A stock could be a sign that one of the functions has dubious reliability. Quite 
often a stock is created to provide internal security against sudden deviations. Stock of finished 
goods are, according to Lumsden (1998), a heap of goods intended to sell or distribute. It often 
binds large amount of capital, simultaneously it will represent a warranty for delivery to the 
customer. One instant affect on the stock turnover is the lead time, and should always be kept as 
short as possible (Lumsden, 1998).  
 
4.2.4 Principles for Storage  
When one forms a stock, it’s important to start by deciding which storage principle to use. 
There’s no general method to decide the optimized location of a part in the storage in question. It 
should rather be based on a set of principles, which will give guidance for a better location, and 
limitations, if any, for the goods. One interesting principle is based on the following conditions: 
    
 Picking position  
 Family groups 
 Walking lengths 
 Popularity, similarity 
 
Picking position principle: The goods that are supposed to be picked simultaneously, should be 
placed next to, or close by each other.   
Family groups principle: This principle states that goods that have similar properties should be 
stored together.   
Walking lengths principle: The walking distance is important for the efficiency in the storage 
when picking goods. 
Popularity- and similarity principle, is based on a ABC breakdown of goods, from a volume 
handled or picking frequency perspective. In a ready stock it’s common that you will find that 
85% of the volume comes from 15% of the goods. 10% of the volumes from 30% of the goods, 
etc, etc. The popularity principle means that the goods are located in the storage from out of 
group membership. The group that account for the largest amount of activities in the ready stock 
is stored close to the outbound function. The transport for picking is hereby decreased (Lumsden, 
1998). 
 
 
Figure 4.2: Popularity- and similarity principle (Lumsden, 1998) 
- 17 - 
 
 
 
 
 
Aronsson (2003), states that it’s important to have the goods properly packed and labeled, when 
sending it from the manufacturing company, this is to facilitate the handling and identification 
and also avoid damages of the goods. Further he claims that it’s desirable to have an even 
outbound flow during the day, which require the carriers to arrive at different time window 
depending on the amount of goods that are picked for transport.  
 
4.2.5 ABC Breakdown 
To differentiate the delivery service depending on products and customers is the same as 
prioritizing what actions should primarily be done. One way to accomplish this is to rank the 
products and customers as "volume value".  
Based on such structure, the delivery service can then be prioritized from out of a combination of 
products and customers that represent the most value or profitability. Differentiating delivery 
service using such a volume value analysis should be seen as a first rough tool for prioritization. 
The analysis should also be supplemented with manual assessments and adjustments. 
 
 
 
Figure 4.3: ABC breakdown (Based on figure;Volymvärdestyrd leveransservice by Mattsson, 2002 ) 
 
 
The figure illustrates how such a volume value driven delivery service can look like. A stands for 
the category with products and customers with the highest volume value. B stands for the 
second-highest and C the lowest volume value. A best possible ranking of the delivery service 
may be AA, BA , AB, BB. You may also need to make adjustments in the choice of delivery 
service for products/customers. In area CA for instance, that area includes products to key 
customers and may be of very large interest (Mattsson, 2002).

4.3 Transports & Delivery Service  
4.3.1 Agreements 
Today people talk about the high requirements when it comes to transportation time. Carriers are 
expected to collect and deliver goods at specified time windows. This places high demands on 
the carriers to come at the right time - not too early nor too late. The carriers also provides 
different time commitments and time guarantees when the goods should latest be delivered at the 
destination. The question then is what those promises are worth when the goods do not arrive on 
time. 
As the world shrinks when it comes to communication, the need to revise and create clear rules 
for how the interface should look like between various parties has grown. It’s important to write 
agreements so that your interests are as well covered for as possible (Stöth, 2004). 
 
4.3.2 Relationship Level 
Transports often require a fairly extensive and complex planning. It’s common for 
manufacturing companies to outsource their transportation to outside carriers. For the 
manufacturing company, it’s important to understand the carrier's situation, as well as it’s 
important for the carrier to understand the requirements and preferences from the transport 
buying company (Aronsson et al, 2003). 
Every company is part of a supply chain and every business has both customers and suppliers. 
Every company is often both customer and supplier themself as well. Due to that, it's hard to 
achieve efficient information and material flow without considering and developing the 
relationship between customer and supplier (Mattsson, 2002). 
 
Conventional suppliers can be divided into two main categories in regards to continuity of the 
relationship. Category one relationship is based entirely on non-recurring or low-frequency 
relation, and evaluation of the supplier is done at each new acquisition. In the second category, 
the relation is more frequent. Acquisition occurs without any specific selection and supplier 
evaluation. Instead, the suppliers belonging to this category, is selected as number one supplier 
for the time being but without any existing agreement or real cooperation (Mattsson, 2002). 
 
Associated suppliers are suppliers in the next level in regards to relationship. Relations with 
associated suppliers are characterized as being long term and that they periodically are reviewed. 
Together and continuously the supplier and buyer strives to reduce inventories and lead times 
and also eliminate the presence of buffers against uncertainties (Mattsson, 2002). 
 
At the highest relationship level is partnership suppliers. Relations with this category of 
suppliers are characterized by the same conditions as for the associated suppliers but also often 
includes joint product development and frequent exchange of information about production 
processes, products and quality issues. It also often involves joint investment in new technology 
and improvements (Mattsson, 2002). 
 
Figure 4.4: Relationship level with suppliers(Mattsson, 2002) 
- 19 - 
 
The different relationship levels in the picture represent different degrees of partnership. It 
requires a great effort to develop and maintain partnership relation, both in terms of time and 
resources. Therefore it's not realistic to establish partnerships with a large number of suppliers. 
Partnership perspective in the supplier relation corresponds better to the requirements in regards 
of develop more efficient supply chains. It also fully supports the holistic approach and the flow-
orientation behind supply change management and process thinking (Mattsson, 2002). 
Mattsson (2002) argue that it's not positive, in every situation, to have partnership relation with 
suppliers. Very little criticism has, however, been raised against this relation between customers 
and suppliers. This might be due to that partnership relation have been created based on a just- 
in-time approach, and that the phenomenon just- in-time has had so much influence that there 
was very little space for criticism. Just- in-time has almost become something that's good by 
definition. 
 
4.3.3 Customer Service 
Efficient logistics systems and supply chain processes in a company creates value for both 
customers and shareholders. Efficient logistics systems can decisively affect the company's 
profitability by being more cost effective and less capital intensive. To capture market share by 
only using good product properties have gradually become more and more difficult. Companies 
are focusing rather on giving the customer an added value beyond what the physical product 
provides. Added value for the customer can come from customer service, marketing, quality of 
products or services (Bjørnland et al, 2003). 
Customer service includes the quality of all activities between a business and its customers, seen 
from the customer's perspective. The concept of customer service can be divided into several 
main components, and one of these components is delivery service (Bjørnland et al, 2003). 
 
4.3.4 Delivery Service 
Before we use delivery service as a generic term, it's good to get an idea of what delivery service 
covers. Different service elements have different importance for companies, depending on 
customers, industry, competitive environment, geographical conditions, etc. The table below 
gives an overview of the most common service elements (Bjørnland et al, 2003): 
 
Table 4.1 Service elements (Bjørnland et al, 2003) 
Element 
Description 
Service level 
Probability that the product is in stock when it is requested.  
Lead time 
The time elapsed from order to delivery. Today many companies are 
working with reducing the lead time. 
Delivery reliability  
(Delivery precision) 
To deliver at the promised time has become very important in recent 
years. The reason is the just-in-time philosophy within the industry. 
There is a clear tendency that customers consider delivery reliability 
as more important than the delivery time. It doesn’t matter if the 
products arrive late or soon, what counts is that they will arrive as 
promised. 
Delivery security 
Means that the right product is delivered, in the correct quantity and 
without damages. 
Information exchange 
Goes in both directions. One important task is to inform the customer 
immediately about any deviation from the promised or normal. 
Customization 
Ability to meet customer requirements. 
Flexibility 
Adaptability to changing conditions 
 
 
 
- 20 - 
 
The delivery service concept is not only important in the relation to external customers. It's just 
as meaningful to measure the internal delivery service levels, which is the deliveries between 
different departments in a company. Aronsson et al (2003), suggest that the following should be 
worth considering in regards to delivery service:  
You need to find out your customer needs and not assume that you yourself can guess the level 
of delivery service that they want. For instance, it's of no help if you reduce the lead time from 
eight days to four days if the customers' requirements is three days. 
 
4.3.5 Service Level 
Customer requirements on delivery service can be determined in many ways, but it's only one 
way that provides safe and reliable answers, namely to ask the customer directly. Valuable 
information about this can also be collected from sellers, order intake and from customer 
complaints, but one should always add the customer's own view of service quality. These type of 
registrations should be performed with regularity, so that changes over time in various market 
segments will be captured. Further, Bjørnland et al (2003) states that you often are able to note 
significant differences between the actual service level and the perceived service level that 
customers have. Many customers, in general, believe that accomplishments on service level 
beyond the ordinary is better than it really is. 
Mattsson (2002), argue that it's not given that an increase in the delivery service in all 
circumstances is positive, and that this is linked to the so-called " law of diminishing marginal 
utility " also applies for delivery service. At what level of service the diminishing marginal 
utility begins is primarily dependent on the service level that the competitors have. To make the 
reasons behind the level of delivery service complete, you must take into account all the costs 
associated with achieving the increased delivery service. These kind of costs often increases 
more than linearly with increasing delivery service. As the cost curve in the picture shows. 
 
 
 
Figure 4.5: Diminishing marginal utility (Mattsson, 2002) 
 
To get a favorable ratio between input required and the improvements achieved, it may be 
desirable to have a selective approach on what activities you plan to do. For delivery service, 
such selective approach can mean focusing on the delivery service elements that has the most 
importance to the specific customers (Mattsson, 2002). 
 
To ease the choice of which service elements to prioritize, and which level the delivery service 
should reach, a performance matrix can be used. The x-axis in the matrix indicates the 
importance of the service elements for the customer, while the y-axis indicates the customers' 
perception of the service. By filling in the matrix for each service element it will give an 
indication where current performance level is higher than necessary, and also where current 
performance level ought to be improved.  
- 21 - 
 
Areas of under -and over- performance should be taken care of primarily, in order to optimize 
resource inputs relative to outcomes. 
 
 
 
Figure 4.6: Based on figure; Fokusering på under- och överprestationer vid optimering av leveransservice by Mattsson, 2002 
 
4.3.6 Transport Pattern 
The need for fast and frequent distribution directly from the manufacturer or the factory, to a 
number of clients, is the base for all distribution (Lumsden, 1998). 
 
Transport buyer's requirements for transport in general is that it should be performed at a low 
price, with short lead times and high delivery service. Today's transport company is working 
with a strong focus on meeting customer requirements as above. Traditionally, there are many 
different players in the transportation industry, which is highly fragmented. This forces 
manufacturing companies to have contact with many different carriers to cover their 
transportation needs (Aronsson et al, 2003). 
 
The simplest and most traditional form of transport pattern means that the transport of materials 
goes directly from supplier to customer order by order and without any connection to other 
customers ' or suppliers' shipments. Each transport is individually optimized and transport time 
can be selected based on the specific order. The need for coordination is thereby minimized and 
possibility to keep delivery time is good. The main disadvantage of direct shipments of this kind 
is the relatively high costs it brings (Mattsson, 2002). 
 
A transport company can be as complex as a manufacturing company to operate. For the 
transport company to work with fast and frequent transport and have high filling ratio it requires 
large volumes. Most manufacturing companies doesn't have sufficient volumes to be able to 
operate their transport services in this way. Instead the solution is to create large volume by 
loading several customers' shipments in the same transport, which is the basic business idea for 
carriers. (Aronsson et al, 2003).  
 
 
- 22 - 
 
 
Figure 4.7: Transport pattern with and without Hub (Aronsson, 2003) 
 
Consolidated shipments provide the opportunity for higher filling ratio of the vehicles. But the 
risk of goods damages increases, since there is an additional handling of the goods. The reality 
for carriers with direct transports is often that the truck only has goods in one direction, and that 
the truck goes back empty. Of course it's waste that the truck goes empty, without load, half the 
time when driving it. That's why it's important to fill the truck also on the way back. The ability 
to do so increases when the goods is handled through a terminal. 
 
One conclusion according to Aronsson et al (2003), is that the cost for transports is reduced, but 
instead it will be a cost for terminal handling. It's important to realize that the correlation is 
somewhat more complex than one initially might think. (Aronsson et al, 2003). 
 
Lumsden (1998), gives the same picture of the pros and cons with handling goods via hubs. 
Distribution via hub solutions often results in steady traffic on the busiest distances and a high 
usage of transports and cargo carriers. Another great advantage is that this type of transportation 
network allows just-in- time deliveries.  
The disadvantages with hub solutions in transportations, if compared with traditional solutions, 
is increased transportation costs, longer transportation times, increased transport distances, goods 
handled multiple times with more injuries as a result.  
This is why there is a big need to create new types of network with the same benefits as hub 
solutions but without the mentioned disadvantages.

5  EMPIRICAL COLLECTION 
5.1 Order to Delivery Process 
Scania has four core processes focusing on the end customer needs. Sales process, Product 
development process, Order to delivery process and Service delivery process (Dept. OD, 2013). 
In this study I will try to, in short terms, explain some parts of the Order to delivery process, 
since it can be of interest for the readers understanding. 
 
During the whole process Scania provides information to both dealers and carriers, where a 
selection is shown in the figure 5.1 below.  
 
 
 
Figure 5.1 Order to delivery process (Scania Inline, 2014) 
 
To start with, at order placement, the customer gives a Desired Delivery Date for the specific 
order/chassis, also called DDD. After a capacity check with the production, Scania provides the 
customer with a Planned Delivery Date, PDD. The delivery, Confirmed Delivery Date (CDD) is 
set up to 2 days prior to PDD or up to 2 days after PDD. 
Immediately after the order is placed, the material procurements, and other activities directly 
linked to the specific order, start. At Batch Closed, BC, the specific order is planned for its final 
assembly.    
Short after BC, Scania provides the customer with the real delivery date, Confirmed Delivery 
Date, CDD.  
CDD is also provided to the carrier in question, together with information about when the chassis 
is expected to be released from the production, Confirmed Release Date, CRD. 
The time elapsed between CRD and CDD, is the time the carrier have available to accomplish 
the delivery to the customer. The time between CRD and CDD differs depending on the carrier 
and market in question. 
All carriers are expected to deliver chassis latest at CDD, but the delivery window is “open” 
already three days prior to CDD. These four days in total is defined as the delivery window.  
 
- 24 - 
 
5.2 Delivery Process 
The delivery process is the base for different delivery conditions. The delivery conditions are 
categorized as DDM (Direct Distribution Market) and Non DDM. In the category DDM there are 
chassis that are delivered direct to markets in Europe and Scania is fully responsible for safety, 
quality, delivery performance and cost for the whole flow between the end assembly to 
customer. DDM markets are for instance Germany, Benelux and Great Britain.   
 
The Non DDM category consist of for instance Overseas deliveries and also Ex Works1. The 
Overseas deliveries are chassis that are planned to go by vessel part of the way to the customer. 
The Overseas market could be the Iraqi or Chinese markets for instance. The DDM and the 
Overseas are similar when it comes to the responsibility from Scania’s point of view. Ex Works 
chassis have the Zwolle yard as their “first delivery address”, and the customer itself is the one 
responsible for picking up the chassis.  
 
The delivery process is global, which means that it’s valid for all the production units. Each 
production unit has a Delivery function that is responsible for the coordination and in control of 
the chassis deliveries.

5.3 Responsibilities within Scania 
5.3.1 Production 
The production is a very well planned activity and all activities are followed up and monitored in 
detail. All Scania’s assembly lines are tacted3 and follow a decided pace, depending on the 
prerequisite in each production units, the order book and the market situation. The point is that it 
is a highly prioritized and planned activity, and a lot of functions are involved in the production 
planning.  
As soon as the order of a chassis is locked in the PRAL4 system, it will be marked with an 
individual chassis number. The dates for when the chassis is planned to be assembled (EA), 
when it has its Confirmed Release Date (CRD), and also the earliest release date (ERD) will be 
calculated and visible for any person with access to PRAL. At the same time as the order is 
visible in PRAL, it will also be transferred into other common systems within Scania. The order 
will for example end up in the MONA5 system for handling all the needed parts and material for 
the assembly line. One part of the MONA system is called PROSSESS6 and here the Outbound 
Logistics are able to follow all the timing and information and later on also manage the activities 
for each individual chassis. It takes approximately one full working day from start assembly to 
end assembly for one chassis in through put time.  
End Flow Activities 
At the End Assembly (EA), the chassis is ready to be tested, and all the equipment is mounted. 
Sometimes the customer wants to have some extra equipment, like additional lights or a 
microwave installed in the cab. The extra equipment can sometimes be as comprehensive as a 
tipper body or sometimes more modest as a Griffin symbol striped along the cab side. This is all 
optional, and within Scania it’s called Fit-For-Use (FFU). All of this FFU-work needs to be 
thoroughly planned and executed after the tacted assembly line.  
A large number of chassis that has additional FFU, is categorized as FFU-light. That is a request 
from the customer, that Scania are able to plan and perform directly on line. It’s FFU with 
workload less than four hours, and the operators at the line are able to do it in the current tact. In 
general 70% of the chassis have FFU that is planned after line. This kind of FFU-work is called 
medium and heavy, and takes between half a day and up to five days to execute.  
 
Some of the FFU-work is called Multi Colour Concept (MCC) and is also offered as an optional 
for the Scania customers. It’s a way of customize the chassis, with divergent colours for instance 
in the chassis, the rims, or the bumpers. The concept sometimes requires additional lead time 
before the assembly line but in occasions also after the assembly line.  
All the FFU-, and MCC work require a given workload and is calculated by PRAL when the 
order is locked. Every single work has a standard time, and will add time to the assembly of the 
chassis.    
 
 
                                                 
3 Tacted flow - Sets the pace for industrial manufacturing lines so that production cycle times can be matched to 
customer demand rate. For example, in automobile manufacturing, cars are assembled on line, at a certain cycle 
time, ideally being moved on to the next station within the tact time so as to neither over or under produce. 
4 PRAL – Allocate customer order in time regarding market and components restriction and the customers desired 
delivery date. Also used for sequencing within an order batch (mixing) at the Chassis PRU's. 
5 MONA - Collect orders, split order to component orders, set manufacturing component PRU and delivery 
point and distribute component orders to CECO (component orders). 
6 Prossess – Supports After line activities, i.e.: Delivery workshop, FFU and MCC, audit, parking maintenance, 
delivery stops and deliveries.

Work Shop 
One common denominator for work performed in the workshop, is that it’s not planned for. Even 
though a chassis has a throughput time on the assembly line for approximately one day in 
Zwolle, there could sometimes be deviations in mounting the parts on line or sometimes shortage 
of parts, this requires correction before sending it to the customer. All of this work will add time 
to the lead time towards the customer.  
 
The target for the production is to have most of the chassis leaving the assembly line as a so 
called “Direct run” chassis. It means that no extra work is needed on the chassis after line, no 
quality deviations, and no material shortage, the chassis doesn’t need to go through the work 
shop at all. Instead it can go directly to the outbound flow and be booked for a pick up by a 
carrier. As a default the production has three additional completion days between End Assembly 
and Confirmed Release Date (CRD). The purpose of the additional time is to complement the 
chassis in case of a prior material shortage. It will also give the production a good chance to live 
up to their delivery precision towards the Outbound Logistics. Scania has a target of 65% direct 
run chassis, which is not always reached. 
Additional Limitations 
The above description should be used as an understanding of the environment and the work 
situation that the outbound function has to relate to. Production activities have strong focus 
within Scania and improvements are already ongoing for some of the described areas. 
This area will not be covered in the Theory chapter, nor in the Analysis chapter. 
 
5.3.2 Outbound Logistics 
The Outbound Logistics function in Zwolle is a small group of 10-12 persons that is responsible 
for the flow of chassis out from the yard and further on to the customers. They handle all types 
of set up in regards of transports, documentations, keys and also all the operational work in the 
outbound area.  
The Outbound Logistics has an operational manager on site in Zwolle, and a process manager in 
Södertälje. This can sometimes give a gap between how the work is done according to the 
processes and how it’s done in the reality. 
The day to day work for the outbound group differs a lot, depending on the whole chain prior to 
the outbound function. The flow of chassis that are ready for delivery arrive in an irregular pace, 
depending on whether it comes from FFU, workshop or as a direct run chassis.  
Forecast 
Once a month the delivery function sends a forecast to the carriers including volumes per 
ordering market for the coming 5 to 16 weeks. The inland deliveries for the next 5 weeks are 
available in the web based transport system SOLEIL. SOLEIL – Scania Outbound Logistics 
Exchange Information on-Line is the interface between Scania delivery functions, transport 
suppliers and distributors for accessing and sharing information regarding the distribution 
process. All transport suppliers are required to work with SOLEIL in real time to monitor 
bookings and report information to keep SOLEIL updated. 
Booking of Chassis 
In direct alignment when a chassis is ready for delivery the parking personnel will park the 
chassis in its own unique parking place. The parking place is generated in the PROSSESS 
system. Then the keys are given to the delivery group, which immediately will start booking the 
chassis in SOLEIL, and this will also give the carrier an indication of chassis being ready for 
pick up. The key collection and booking are done approximately every other hour between 6am 
to 10:30pm. According to the delivery process the first possible day to book a chassis for pickup 
- 28 - 
 
is the ERD and this is created in PRAL and visible in SOLEIL. When a chassis is bookable the 
line turns green in SOLEIL. This is a very distinct signal for the SOLEIL user. 
In the SOLEIL application the carriers also gets information of planned deliveries already from 
the Batch Closed (BC) point, which is up to four weeks before Confirmed Release Date (CRD). 
The information is updated with new chassis at least once a week, and gives the carriers a good 
possibility to foresee difficulties in capacity, load planning or other issues that they need to work 
proactively with. The responsibility for the delivery group is to  handle all the preparation of 
delivery documents, and when it's needed also export documents.  
 
5.3.3 Yard Design  
The outside yard in Zwolle is located between a highway, a residential area and a canal. It means 
that the possibility to grow, or somehow increase the space, is very limited. 
 
 
 
Picture 5.1: Outside yard, Zwolle (Scania, 2012) 
 
Sometimes there are deviations in the final assembly line which will cause the delivery function 
a number of challenges. Most of the deviation is handled quick without giving so much influence 
on the delivery function, like shortage for parts, or trouble with mounting a part on line. The 
deviation referred to starts on line, and will probably affect the rest of the chain of activities 
afterwards. This results, in some cases, in chassis being delivered to the delivery function later 
than CRD. Meanwhile there is no possibility to book the chassis for pick up, and the chassis will 
need space on the outside yard a while longer than it was planned for.   
In some cases there are deviations on line that could have quite a big influence on the delivery 
function in terms of yard space. This is known as a delivery stop. The delivery stop means that 
all chassis that are ready for booking or already booked are revoked by the production unit. No 
chassis are allowed to leave the outdoor yard, until the root cause is found and corrected. This 
will quickly increase the amount of chassis in need of a parking spot.  
Shared Yard 
Some of the chassis will leave the yard within short time after the end of assembly. And some 
will stand for a longer period of time. The reason for the different amount of time is depending 
on a lot of factors, some of them connected to the production unit and their conditions, as 
described above.  
- 29 - 
 
Other factors that will affect the yard time for the chassis, are if the chassis is for a customer 
overseas, or if it’s a DDM or Ex Works chassis. All of these chassis are handled differently. The 
yard time also sometimes depends on which market the chassis shall be delivered to. If it’s a 
market that is financially regulated by Scania, the chassis need to be financially released before it 
can leave the yard. So, regardless of the reason for why the chassis need to be in the yard, it will 
for sure take space.  
The area in Zwolle that all refer to as the yard is divided between the production unit, the FFU, 
the work shop, the Ex Works chassis and the outbound logistics function. It’s not formally 
divided, and there are no physical borders or fences. It’s more divided by custom and habit. The 
best way of describing where the border is, is by saying that it’s flexible.  
What they all are dealing with is an invisible “fence” in the middle of the yard, depending on the 
situation within the different functions. In general there are three different scenarios to describe 
how the yard is used today. 
Scenario 1-Stable Output from Production & Low FFU

Turnover for Chassis on the Yard  
All of the reasons why chassis stand for a shorter or longer period is well known by heart of all 
the Outbound Logistics workers. They are all very experienced, and can give a detailed view of 
the situation  instantly if you would ask them. Even though, Scania also measure the 
performance. Not specific only for Zwolle, but within all outbound logistics functions. 
QlikView7 is an application used by Scania to follow up all the statistics within the outbound 
logistics performance. By looking at the statistics for pickup performance for the carriers picking 
up DDM chassis, one can see that the pickup time varies between approximately 0 day (booked 
and picked up the same day) and 10 days. A few chassis even longer than 10 days. 
The figures for pickup performance is showed below and is valid for 2013. 
The green bars are considered as good performance according to OTS. The red bars are 
considered as late pickup.  
 
 
Figure 5.7: Pick up performance graph – DDM (Created by the author) 
5.4 Carriers Responsibilities 
5.4.1 From a Scania Perspective 
OTS - Outbound Transport Specification - Scania has a document that describes the transport 
process. The short term is OTS and it regulates what Scania expects the carriers to do, and also 
what Scania commits to do. This document is the base for the operational work between Scania 
and the carriers.  
Pick Up 
When the carrier gets information about booking of a chassis, they need to, according to the 
process, confirm the booking trough SOLEIL. The carriers in Zwolle don’t do that today, 
sometimes they announce their pickup when they already have arrived at the gate. For security 
reasons, only announced trailers are allowed to enter the factory yard to pick up chassis. 
Therefore the carrier will have to state information about planned loading date (PLD), and time 
(PLT), estimated time of arrival (ETA) at the delivery address and also some pick up identifier, 
either equipment license plate or driver identification.  
 
Inside the yard the carriers collect keys and documents, and locate the chassis on the parking lot. 
Sometimes the chassis is placed a fairly long distance from where the driver entered the yard. All 
loading is done in a specific loading area, so the carrier picks up the chassis and drives it to the 
loading area. Before loading the chassis the carrier needs to inspect the chassis carefully. The 
expected time for loading is approximately 2 hours from key hand over to exit the gate. 
                                                 
7 QlikView – Application that supports follow up and generates reports and statistics charts  
- 32 - 
 
According to the OTS, Scania normally expects carriers to pick up chassis within 48 hours 
calculated from booking date (BKD) in SOLEIL. Many of the chassis going out from Zwolle 
yard stand for a longer period of time than 48 hours. 
 
To give the carriers the best prerequisite to manage their planning ahead, Scania provides the 
following information in SOLEIL: 
 
 Chassis number 
 Product type 
 Dimensions (length, width, height, weight) 
 Product specification (e.g. air deflector position, auxiliary parts) 
 Pick up address 
 Delivery address 
 Available for pick up 
 Requested delivery date 
 Transport priority

Delivery Window 
How well the carriers perform in delivery precision is carefully measured and followed on a 
weekly basis. The delivery window is defined as 4 working days in total - the confirmed delivery 
date (CDD), and maximum 3 days prior to CDD. 
 
 
Figure 5.10: Graphical description Delivery window (Scania OTS 7.1, 2013) 
 
Delivery Precision  
Information regarding actual date and time for the delivered chassis (ADD), must be reported in 
SOLEIL within two hours after delivery, by the carrier. If the delivery date and time is outside 
the delivery window a reason for the deviation must be reported. 
 
The target for the carriers overall is to manage minimum 97,5% of all chassis within the defined 
delivery window. For 2013 the carriers didn’t reach the minimum level. In some cases the level 
is more in line with the demands. In total the carriers reached 88,1% delivery precision.

Transport Pattern  
The pattern of how the chassis are transported within Europe, is best showed graphically with 
some additional explanations. 
The red lines shows where in Europe the Zwolle produced chassis are delivered. The black dots 
gives an indication of how the amount of volumes are shared. Focus areas in regards to delivery 
country for DDM trucks is Great Britain, Benelux and Germany. 
 
 
Figure 5.11: Delivery pattern for Zwolle produced trucks (Created by the author) 
The responsibility between the carriers is divided into which area in Europe they deliver the 
chassis to. They are approximately 10-15 carriers which Scania splits the volumes between - 
only four of them with considerable volumes to manage, and some with minor volumes or even 
just occasional chassis.  
 
5.4.2 The Carriers Reality and Challenges 
This part of the case study is based on field studies carried out at one carrier in Sweden (as a 
pilot study) and one field study with depth interview at one of the largest Zwolle carrier.  
The baseline described below should not be seen as reality for all carriers, but should be seen as 
a possible reality for a carrier and is sufficient for this study to get a picture from a different 
perspective than from Scania. The specific carrier in this study is called the Carrier.  
Business Environment 
The Carrier is operational with logistics centres in several markets in Europe, and has the 
headquarter situated in Austria. They work with what they prefer to call door-to-door service and 
includes service that reaches from the production facility to the dealer.  
 
 
Figure 5.12: Door-to-Door service at the carrier (Carrier, 2014) 
 
The Carrier has in total 1300 employees, and a truck fleet for approximately 600 trucks, and also 
10 block trains. In 2012 they transported approximately 1 100 000 vehicles, and they carries both 
cars, agriculture tractors and trucks. To carry this amount of cars they have about 1 500 000 m2 
to use as hubs, around Europe.  
- 35 - 
 
 
The company is divided into two different main business, the regular car transports, and the high 
& heavy transports, like tractors and trucks. For the “High & Heavy” segment they have 
approximately 85 loading trucks to use, all trailers. Some of the trailers are  internally built to fit 
their requirements, and some are custom made by an external contractor. Most of the trucks are 
18,75 meters, which is within the legal requirements for these types of vehicles. The Carrier also 
has dispensation for some of the trucks to be 20,25 meters full length. 
 
The work as a driver is highly demanding, and the Carrier believes they have very talented and 
skilled drivers. To be a good driver, and able to do the demanding loading and unloading for 
High & Heavy trucks, the Carrier only employs senior drivers for this task. The Carrier is 
responsible for training the drivers, and this is carried out in their facility at the head quarter. 
Pick Up 
When Scania sends a booking of a chassis, it will give the Carrier a signal to start their planning 
for pick up. The Carrier has their own planning and booking system, but they merge all the 
information from SOLEIL as soon as it’s available, or several times a day. The planning of 
which truck they need to book in order to load the pickup truck with as high load ratio as 
possible is a real challenge.  
Now, for the Carrier in Austria they have really experienced persons who are very familiar with 
the Scania requirements in regards to weight and measurement for the different Scania specified 
trucks. Depending on which Scania specification the truck has, they need to plan which pickup 
truck to match it with. Some of the technical specifications are more important to bear in mind 
when planning than others. For instance; number of axles, axle distance, cab height, bumper 
height, wind deflector, chassis length, etc. According to the carrier the most challenging chassis 
to load are the ones with high roof and low bumper. As often as possible the Carrier aims to load 
three chassis on the same truck. This is not always possible, depending on the above criteria, and 
also what direction in Europe, or market the chassis are supposed to be delivered.  
 
The Carrier has the possibility to use one of their hubs and this increases their filling ratio from 
Zwolle and further. Before and after loading the driver is responsible for checking the chassis for 
any damages, or deviations. The Carrier has a reward system for the drivers when they reach 
zero deviations. They also have a bonus connected to if the driver reaches a certain 
environmental goal that is set by the Carrier.  
 
 
Figure 5.13: Loading scenario (Carrier, 2014) 
 
 
 
The carrier takes part of SOLEIL information from Scania every week, it is used by the carrier to 
plan its total capacity ahead.

6  ANALYSIS  
6.1 What’s the Problem? 
Today, Scania Zwolle has a very limited space to store their manufactured chassis, after 
assembly line, for further transport to the customer. In line with customer demand Scania will 
increase the pace for how many chassis they are producing per day, which gives a growing need 
for more space to place the ready stock, or another solution that quickly moves the chassis away 
from the outside yard. Outbound Logistics in Zwolle has overall responsibility for handling the 
chassis from the point after line where the chassis is ready to be picked up by a carrier, until the 
chassis is at the customer site. The following section of the report aims to outline what measure 
Scania can implement in their current handling of chassis. 
 
6.1.1 What’s the Baseline? 
Outbound Logistics function in Zwolle has a rather straggly task. They are expected to be 
flexible based on what the production unit can deliver, and continuously monitor their 
performance. They need to adjust to the shared yard, and relate to the constantly changed 
conditions physically. A large amount of the day-to-day work is about adapting to new 
conditions , and to "put out fires". Outbound Logistics has what you can describe as a “tool” to 
use in their daily work, they can make use of the delivery process as a basic tool. It describes the 
various operations involved and when the activity is to be executed. The Outbound Logistics 
group itself has extensive experience and has extremely good knowledge of the daily operational 
work. One problem is that the delivery process is not always followed, as it should be.   
 
The process states that the booking should be done relative to CRD. Outbound Logistics 
sometimes deviates from what the process states and this seemingly small deviation may perhaps 
give unnecessarily large consequences. The “may perhaps” in this sentence is due to the fact that 
no one can be completely sure. One consequence you are facing when departing from an agreed 
process is that it becomes difficult to trust the measurements, even if you select some to measure. 
 
 
Figure 6.1 Red cross demonstrating the booking deviations  (Created by the author) 
- 38 - 
 
 
Most common, one deviates from a process for a reason, in this case the outbound delivery group 
wants to open up the possibility for the carrier to pick up the chassis, away from the Zwolle yard, 
and get the chassis into the supply chain quicker. Despite good intentions, about being more 
efficient, the result of the deviation isn’t desirable. 
   
Processes can be one of the most difficult things to relate to in an organization. When do you 
know if they are good, bad or even followed? Basically, to be able to measure performance, a 
type of map that everyone can read is needed. A map so that everyone can see if they are moving 
in the same direction, is a process main function. 
 
For outbound logistics function in Zwolle, the same delivery process is valid as of Södertälje and 
Angers. The same map will be used no matter what site you are working on. 
Since Zwolle doesn’t follow the same map, it will be extra difficult to measure their 
performance, and even if you try to, you risk the results and interpretation of the result with 
inaccurate measurements. You simply don’t know what baseline you have in case you 'd like to 
make some kind of change management. Since you have no real starting point, it’s almost 
impossible to know where along the supply chain, you need to perform the change. In that state 
you might be tempted to adjust randomly, and will never find the "correct" place to adjust. 
 
6.1.2 To Measure is to Know 
It’s quite common to say that “to measure is to know”, and such a statement is rather easy to 
agree upon. The incentive to do the measurements is quite often also rather obvious. For some 
it’s somewhat trickier when it comes to the selection of what to measure, and how to measure. 
Since the trouble with the yard in Zwolle, in this study, is the limited space for ready stock of 
chassis, one suggestion is to start measuring performances in a different way. Both in 
performance of the Outbound Logistics group, and performance of the carriers. But as long as 
the team deviates from the process, you are not able to know for sure what you see in the 
measurements.  
 
One of the first arrangements, for Outbound Logistics, would be to start following the agreed 
process. Then, and only then you can begin to interpret the measurements. This is based on that 
everyone in the group understands the entire process, and the benefits of using it. Such a change 
will most likely make the operative work even more difficult initially. One even risks to have a 
worse working situation initially, than before a change. This is good to be aware of, and it has to 
been taken into account, but if you are serious about finding where to do the change 
management, it’s crucial to first start by following the map.  
 
When the process is well incorporated, it’s valuable to start measuring the progress. A first 
measurement which most likely will give the group the correct information about both their and 
their carriers' performance is to measure how they book transports relative to the CRD.  
 
If the booking is performed as the process requires, relative to CRD, the Outbound Logistics 
team will not only be able to measure their performance, but also their carriers’ performance. For 
the carriers’ performance it would be interesting to measure the pickup performance.  
Booking relative to the CRD, is shown in table 6.1 below. 
  
- 39 - 
 
Table 6.1 Booking relative to CRD (Created by the author) 
 
 
 Yard time – Calendar days between Key to outbound and Pick up date 
 Pick up performance – Working days between BKD and Pick up by carrier 
 
Chassis 1 
In the first example the chassis is ready some time before CRD, and the keys are delivered to the 
Outbound Logistics group. They book a carrier as soon as they have the key, and a notice is sent 
to the carrier. The carrier sees the booking but is not able to act upon it, since the CDD isn’t 
planned until the 21st of October. The carrier can’t load the chassis until closer to CDD, if the 
carrier doesn’t have a hub to utilize. The CDD is the KPI Scania uses to measure their carriers’ 
performance as of today, so this date is more important than pickup time, for both Scania and the 
carrier.  
If we measure, it would have shown 8 working days pick up time, and this amount of time is not 
fair to blame on the carrier.  
 
Chassis 2  
Here we have an example of a carrier not able to manage the 48 hours limit for pick up. But 
since the Outbound Logistics have followed the process, and booked the chassis accordingly, the 
performance will show real accountable figures and they are able to act upon them.  
 
Chassis 3 
In this third example the chassis is ready closer to CRD, but still a few days early. In this case 
Outbound Logistics received the key but waited with the booking until the chassis in SOLEIL 
was “green”. The carrier picked up the chassis within 1 day from booking. In this case the 
specific carrier managed the 48 hours pick up performance limit. But if the chassis should have 
been booked already at finished date (Key to outbound), they would have failed.  
 
From out of the above three scenarios one can draw the conclusion that regardless of when the 
booking is done, the chassis would still have to stand at the yard, waiting for pick up. That is of 
course correct, although it’s not possible to say if it’s because of the final assembly, producing 
the chassis too early, or if it’s the carriers that have a poor pick up performance. When you start 
to measure these, there is a possibility to feedback and address the problem to where it belongs. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 40 - 
 
SOLEIL is the tool to use to see when a chassis is ready for booking. When bookable the chassis 
number turns green, as shown below in the left column.  
 
 
Figure 6.2 SOLEIL ”Green chassis” – Ready to book (Created by the author) 
6.2 What’s Possible for Outbound Logistics to Change? 
6.2.1 Efficient Planning? 
One reason that the chassis might stand longer than necessary, on the yard in Zwolle could 
depend on how the outbound logistics has planned their  warehousing of the chassis. The ready 
stock’s primary function is to manage the confirmed delivery date, CDD.  
When the chassis is delivered from the manufacturing side, and is handed over to Outbound 
Logistics group, it will be assigned to a random parking space, via PROSSESS. The chassis will 
be assigned any random parking space, given the parking space isn’t occupied and holds the 
chassis from a size perspective. When the chassis is parked in place, the key will be handed over 
to the outbound group, and a booking of transport is initiated. Some of the consequences in 
regards to how the booking is managed are already handled prior to this section. 
 
Having the chassis parked randomly in the ready stock (in the yard), gives two problem. One is 
that the drivers picking up chassis at the yard will have long distances that they need to walk to 
reach the chassis. This could mean that the driver needs to leave his transport in the loading area 
for unnecessary time with the result of obstructing the loading area. Maybe that’s not a big issue 
today, but with an increased tact in the assembly line, it might be a problem in the future, and 
then the loading area will be a bottle neck. Having the chassis parked randomly in the ready 
stock also means that three different chassis, planned to be picked up at the same time by the 
same carrier, can be parked in three different directions on the yard. This gives the same 
consequences as above, long distances, long loading time, with an increased risk of getting a 
bottle neck at the loading area.  
  
Stock arise from slightly different reasons , depending on where it’s located, what industry it 
concerns and also the products own conditions. Outbound Logistics in Zwolle has many external 
factors that they need to relate to. The yard is divided in a flexible way, meaning that Outbound 
Logistics constantly must adapt, always depending on how well the production side manages its 
supplies in the chain. This means that production side can all of a sudden take over outbound 
logistics warehouse locations (parking spaces), with the result that the Outbound Logistics needs 
to find a quick solution to the lack of space. 
- 41 - 
 
 
6.2.2 Sharper Boundaries 
The yard in Zwolle has clear physical limits for how large the stock cat get. But even though, 
there are ways to plan and organize the ready stock inventory. For the ready stock of chassis in 
Zwolle, no distinction is made for the chassis as of today, there is no difference whether it’s 
going to the Great Britain or Germany. There is no difference whether the chassis is loaded and 
transported by carrier 1 or carrier 2. The ready stock isn’t grouped, or planned based on any 
volume value, not on delivery country volume nor on carrier volume. For carriers, it’s usually 
one, or a few countries directly linked to a specific carrier to deliver within, so if you choose to 
do an ABC break down on the delivery country, it would probably ease the carriers situation.  
 
Looking at the chassis transported to Great Britain for instance: In this case all chassis go to the 
port of  Rotterdam first, for further transport by vessel.  
Could Zwolle Outbound Logistics gain anything by storing  these chassis within the same 
"storage space " on the yard ? Well, let’s look at an example. 
 
In 2013, the carrier had a pick up performance of about 40% for the Great Britain chassis. That 
means that the carriers picked up the chassis within 48 hours after they were booked in 4 out of 
10 cases. This has not been measured on a regular basis (pick up performance), but is of course 
far too low to be considered as satisfactory. When this was detected, Scania, starting in April 
2014, renegotiated their agreement and shifted out some volumes between carriers. Now the 
volume to Great Britain is approximately 100 chassis per week. These chassis are picked up by a 
carrier who runs a shuttle service between Zwolle and Rotterdam.  
 
The bookings for these chassis are not primarily with CRD in focus, these are booked as soon as 
available from production. This has been decided because the harbour in this case acts as a hub. 
The agreement with the Great Britain chassis is that Scania is able to use the harbour in 
Rotterdam and Felixstowe as kind of a ready stock inventory. Up to 150 chassis are allowed 
divided in the two harbours. This is of course an advantage for Scania due to the fact that Zwolle 
yard has its limitations.  
Approximately 20 chassis need to be picked up per day if they are dispatched over one week. 
Three chassis can be picked up in each transport, resulting in approximately seven rounds back 
and forth to the port of Rotterdam per day. If each loading takes between 90 and 120 minutes, 
there could be a time savings for all involved, if you manage to optimize the conditions for the 
carrier to just enter the gate, go directly to the parked chassis in the agreed area, load, and then 
leave again, all in let's say between 60-90 minutes instead.  
 
At the most, this could mean decreasing the handling time by half. But the plus side is not only 
the reduction in handling time, it can ultimately also mean that the carrier has time to load one or 
two more transports of chassis per day.  
 
With the expected increased volumes from production, together with the observation that the 
loading area could turn into a bottle neck in the future, this type of solution is advantageous. It 
would probably ease the transport of Great Britain chassis. Similarly, you can also choose to 
group the chassis depending on which carrier who’s supposed to transport the chassis. An ABC 
break down can identify the specific volumes that each particular carrier has. See table 6.2.

Figure 6.3 New yard plan - Zwolle after ABC analysis (Created by the author) 
 
If the Outbound Logistics group will be able to plan and control its ready stock in the way that 
optimizes pickups of chassis from the yard, it requires that they have a clear border towards the 
production side. There is always a trade-off of how one should/could/ought to think in regards to 
what function to be given a higher priority than the other. But one can’t deny the difficulty for 
Outbound Logistics group to plan and manage its ready stock, if the group now and then 
suddenly faces completely changed conditions.  
 
It’s impossible, with such a short study as this, which doesn’t even include the production side, 
to claim that this is the best solution for Scania as a company. But what’s really crucial, is to 
organize the internal management, and planning towards the carriers.  
6.3 Carriers Performance 
6.3.1 What Defines a Good Relationship? 
An important player in terms of how fast chassis leave the yard is of course the carriers. They are 
responsible for physically moving the chassis from its place on the yard and further on to the 
- 43 - 
 
customer. Everyone who has insight in the supply chain knows that it can be extremely complex, 
almost perceived as slightly confusing. With the high demands, and with quite small margins, as 
everybody has, there is not much room for mistakes or deviations in how the carriers are 
performing. To fully get what you need for your business, it’s crucial how you write your 
agreements with a carrier, or supplier. Today, there are parts in the arrangements between 
carriers and Scania leaving space for interpretation. The interpretation referred to, is isolated to 
one single sentence, which reads:  
 
 
" Scania normally expects the carriers to pick up chassis within 48 hours calculated 
 
from the booking date (BKD) and time in Soleil, for all chassis deliveries. "  
 
The meaning of “expects” in this sentence is vague and leaves room for the carrier to choose , as 
long as the carrier keeps CDD. This contributes to the difficulty for the Outbound Logistics 
group to plan and organize their warehousing and operative work themselves. The carriers are, 
except for the production planning, the players who most strongly can influence whether a 
chassis is picked up in what Scania considers as on time or not on time. In today's internal 
performance measurements (KPIs), there is no regular monitoring of this, but there must be other 
benefits for Scania then, if this hasn’t been prioritised to measure. The advantage for Scania is 
that they have good prerequisites to achieve high results when maintaining a high relationship 
level with their carriers. The relationship level with carrier three in this study, is recognized as a 
high level relationship, it’s a carrier that has hub facilities, and they can use it for planning and 
optimizing transportation and filling rate.  
 
When looking at statistics for pick up performance over the previous year, you can see that a lot 
of chassis stand longer than Scania would like them to. Is it because of the booking is too early? 
We can’t know for sure, but you can interpret the statistics as if the carrier may not use the hub 
to the extent desirable from a Scania perspective.  
 
This specific relationship should be kept high, for today’s and future cooperation. But as long as 
Scania doesn’t know for sure which level of performance that the carrier holds, then Outbound 
Logistics is not able to give any feedback that can bring the overall situation to improve. Any 
changes from the current situation to get a better outflow of chassis from the yard in Zwolle, 
must not affect the delivery accuracy in a negative direction at all.  
 
6.3.2 Love, Peace and Understanding 
The relationships that Scania has with their carriers is extremely crucial for the last part of the 
supply chain. Delivery precision is not quite as high as the level that Scania has stated as a 
satisfactory level, but in general it reaches approximately 80%. One reason for the relatively high 
delivery precision is that Scania share information really early with their carriers. To be able to 
perform their internal planning well, they receive information about chassis physical conditions, 
delivery address and also CDD.  
 
Here we can see the benefits for Scania when having a close cooperation with their carriers, the 
more and better information Scania shares, the better the carrier is able to prepare. When it 
comes to choosing what carriers to contract and how the volumes are allocated between the 
carriers, there are a lot of factors to evaluate. One of the factors is their common history, and the 
fact that Scania and the carriers have had a collaboration during many years, sometimes decades. 
By knowing each other's abilities and needs, they can mutually benefit from this.   
 
If one again uses the Carrier as an example, Scania has over time given a greater responsibility to 
the Carrier. The Carrier also has access to multiple hubs, and this can be a great advantage for 
- 44 - 
 
Scania. From out of the pickup statistics one can say that the carrier probably does not use the 
hub solution as frequent as suits Scania best.   
With this carrier, Scania has agreed that Scania shall book a chassis as soon as it’s available on 
the Zwolle yard, and the Carrier, in this case, has 72 hours to use  for pick up window. Since the 
Carrier has their own hub, they are able to place the chassis there pending on the CDD to come 
within reach. Despite having three days to their disposal instead of two like the other carriers, 
they still don’t reach a pickup performance factor corresponding to more than 83%. Since the 
stated target is 90%, there is still at least 7 percentage to increase their performance with.  
 
Additionally to the relatively low pick up performance, the carrier has advantages in pick up 
time and their hub solution. Is the hub solution a win-win-situation in this case, or is Scania the 
loser in this arrangement? Well, Scania still has chassis standing on the yard longer time than 
they want to. Scania is also the one taking risks with having more damages on the chassis, when 
using the hub solution, since the damages are increasing with the number of conducted loading 
and unloading.  
 
 
Figure 6.4 Carrier - Pickup performance during 2013 (Created by the author) 
This pattern feels familiar from the example above with Great Britain chassis, and is considered 
to be a not satisfactory performance. 
It’s obvious when conducting these type of measurements that it’s far too vague to indicate an 
expectation in a governing contract. If you want it to be an effective time limit for the carriers, 
regardless of 48 or 72 hours, you need to be more specific, and phrase the text for example like 
“must be picked up within xx hours... "    
 
But as stated in the section above, Scania has had collaboration with these carriers for decades 
sometimes, which means that they have had a very close and long relationship. They may not 
have evolved together in partnership, maybe more like a parallel development, as in symbiosis. 
Carriers know the Scania customers very well, and they also know how to treat each customer. 
That is very valuable for Scania.  
Is there more to do for the carriers from Scania 's side then? On a direct question to the Carrier, 
the answer was simple ;  
 
 
 
"Maybe it’s conceivable to plan the yard based on where the chassis is to be 
 
delivered"

7  CONCLUSIONS  
 The result shows how the ready stock and outbound logistics is designed today. 
 
 The result shows how Zwolle can design their outbound logistics in the future, to increase 
the turnover rate on ready stock of chassis, without adding any cost per chassis.  
 
o By performing booking according to the decided process. 
o By following the carriers pick-up performance, and act upon the measures. 
o By performing a complete ABC break down according to volume value. 
o By creating sharper boundaries and plan the ready stock based on the results from 
the ABC break down. 
o By implementing the above actions within the frame for today’s recourses.  
 
 The result does not show that the pickup time for the carriers will reach 12 hours or less.

8  RECOMMENDATIONS AND FUTURE WORK  
Within logistics there are many activities that have to fit into other activities, and they often 
require a clear guiding. A great amount of the operational work in Outbound Logistics group 
gives ultimately a satisfied customer, and it’s of course one of the main goals for Scania. The 
measurements focused on in this study, the pickup performance, is a measurement that currently 
isn’t used and evaluated as a KPI (Key Performance Index). All statistics are available in 
Qlickview and can quite easily be compiled for specific time periods. 
 
Now, the study doesn't just handle how Scania's carriers are performing, but is included rather as 
a comprehension for the reader. The findings that have emerged during this study, show that 
Scania can benefit from keeping, at least some of their carriers' relationships at a high level. 
  
The finding about the negative consequences that appear by not using the delivery process 
accurate, wasn’t obvious from the start. Even though it’s quite a small deviation, to not perform 
booking relative to the CRD, it’s not possible to disregard. 
Despite the small deviation it can be the root of either poor figures in the statistics, or low 
performance of Scania’s carriers in regards of the pickup performance . The truth lies probably 
somewhere in between. 
 
The issues affecting ready stock planning and internal control is one of the most important topics 
in this study. For future work in regards to these issues, it’s crucial that the persons within the 
operational area in Outbound Logistics group, the ones with all experience, are the ones shaping 
and developing the best possible way of working with their ready stock. This part of the 
outbound logistics the group themselves are able to govern. The benefit is that all concerned can 
gain from the fact that Outbound Logistics in Zwolle has a self controlled and conceived 
planning. 
 
The recommendations for future work are: 
 
 Start to follow the delivery process and use ERD (Earliest Release Date). 
 Start to follow up on the carriers pickup performance. 
 Do a well balanced ABC analysis, based on the current carriers.  
 Plan the ready stock inventory, based on the result from the ABC analysis. 
 When a current agreement expires, make sure the new agreement is written with clearer 
request and focus from a Scania perspective.
