Sammanfattning 
 
Detta är ett examensarbete genomfört på institutionen för Maskinkonstruktion på 
Kungliga Tekniska Högskolan (KTH) i Stockholm. Examensarbetet är utfört på el-
utvecklingen på Volvo Car Corporation (VCC) i Göteborg med start i augusti 2006. VCC är 
idag en del av företaget Ford Motor Company (FMC). Det globala samarbetet inom FMC 
är mellan Ford Europa, Ford Nordamerika, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mazda och Volvo Car 
Corporation.  
 
Samarbetet inom FMC har bidragit till att el-utvecklingen på VCC står inför helt nya 
utmaningar avseende systemlösningar för informations- och kravhantering. Idag arbetar 
olika utvecklingsavdelningar inom FMC med olika system samt dokument för att hantera 
information och krav. Det finns idag ingen gemensam databas där information kan 
hanteras globalt och där produktinformation kan spåras genom hela dess livscykel. Idag 
är endast den slutgiltiga produkten dokumenterad och det finns ingen möjlighet att spåra 
det iterativa arbete som ligger till grund för produkten. Förhoppningsvis är strävan mot 
ett gemensamt informationshanteringssystem (Product Lifecycle Management system) en 
nyckelfaktor till problemen med krav- och informationshantering, ändringshantering samt 
återanvändning och informationsspridning inom organisationen.  
 
Våren 2006 startade ett globalt projekt inom FMC med syfte att utveckla verktyg samt 
metodstöd för utvecklare inom el-utvecklingen. Projektet heter VSEM och har som 
huvudsyfte att utveckla verktygsstöd för bland annat informations- och kravhantering. 
Det är svårt att bedriva ett globalt projekt med många viljor och åsikter. Att föra in ett 
system inom el-utvecklingen på Ford är en komplex och svår uppgift. Det första steget 
VCC kommer att ta mot ett globalt informationshanteringssystem (Product Lifecycle 
Management system (PLM-system)) inom FMC är införandet av ett system för att hantera 
krav.  
 
Syftet med examensarbetet är att ta fram framgångsfaktorer/kriterier för att bättre 
lyckas med införandet av ett informationshanteringssystem. En process har arbetats fram 
för införandet av ett kravhanteringssystem – vilket är ett första steg mot ett 
informationshanteringssystem (PLM-system). Metoden vid framtagning av resultatet är i 
form av ett flertal intervjuer inom el-utvecklingen på VCC, en litteraturstudie samt en 
studie av tre tidigare projekt inom företaget.

Abstract 
 
This is a Master of Science thesis commissioned by Volvo Car Corporation (VCC) in 
Gothenburg, Sweden. The author, Sara Molneryd, is a student at the Royal Institute of 
Technology (KTH) in Stockholm. The work was performed during autumn 2006 in the 
department of Electrical & Electronics Systems Engineering (EE development) at VCC. 
VCC is today a part of the company Ford Motor Company (FMC). FMC is a multinational 
co-operation between Ford Europe, Ford North America, Jaguar, Land Rover, Mazda and 
Volvo Car Corporation. This co-operation has established new kinds of requirements 
considering the need for a competitive and complex system solution for all employees at 
FMC. 
 
The focus for this thesis is the implementation process of a requirement management 
system (RM system), which is the first step toward an information management system 
(Product Lifecycle Management system (PLM system)) at FMC, and factors contributing to 
the successful implementation of this project. This thesis is limited to the department of 
Electrical & Electronics Systems Engineering at VCC only, which, as mentioned, is a part 
of FMC. The definition for PLM is as follows: 
 
“Product lifecycle management is an integrated, information-driven approach to all 
aspects of a product's life - from its design inception through its manufacture, 
deployment and maintenance, culminating in its removal from service and final 
disposal”.[PLM Development Consortium, University of Michigan, 2007] 
 
The demands of an information management system, such as a PLM system are immense 
in the automotive industry. Designers within EE development at VCC currently work with 
textual documents when managing requirements and other types of product information. 
This is time-consuming and inefficient. There is a great need of change from the manual 
work procedure into a computerised environment. During 2006, a global project called 
VSEM was begun at VCC with the intention of developing support tools and methods for 
designers within EE development at FMC. Implementing a new IT system within FMC is a 
difficult and complex process. It is hard to manage a global project, such as Vehicle 
Systems Engineering Management (VSEM), as it involves so many people who work with 
the implementation process. Employees within FMC have high expectations from the 
 
 
6 
VSEM project and the need for a more efficient way of handling requirements and 
information are highly apparent.  
 
The overall objective of this thesis is divided into two parts:  
 
1. To identify criteria/factors leading to a successful introduction of an information 
management system.  
2. To develop an implementation process for a requirement management system – 
the first step towards a PLM system in EE development at VCC.  
 
This will be done through interviews with employees, a literature review and an analysis 
of studies of three earlier projects within VCC. 
 
The conclusion of this study shows the great need for change in work methods for 
designers handling information and requirements. An implementation process has been 
identified with guidelines on how to handle different phases of the process. Consequently, 
a process has been developed and as such, factors leading to success and criteria for a 
more successful changeover have been defined.

1. Introduction 
This is a master's thesis commissioned by Volvo Car Corporation (VCC) in Torslanda, 
Gothenburg. The author, Sara Molneryd, is a student at the Royal Institute of Technology 
(KTH) in Stockholm. The work was performed during autumn 2006 at the department of 
Electrical & Electronics Systems Engineering (EE development) at VCC.  
 
Within the Electrical & Electronics (EE) Systems Engineering at Ford Motor Company 
(FMC) VSEM represents a change management project to manage a new IT system 
solution for information and requirement management. The multinational co-operation 
between the brands within FMC establishes new kinds of requirements considering the 
need for a competitive and complex system solution for the employees at FMC. It 
requires larger projects to be better synchronised, to involve more people with different 
backgrounds and nationalities. This makes greater demands on IT systems supporting all 
organisational diversity and technical needs. Cross-brand co-operation leads to difficulties 
when employees have to communicate requirements and other product information 
within the organisation. The development of more efficient IT systems to support 
information and requirement management is an essential part in the future for the 
automotive industry. The demand for shorter lead-times and higher pressure to complete 
tasks in a shorter time, while still maintaining high quality, is immediate. An information 
management system as a product lifecycle management (PLM) system in the EE and 
software (SW) development can manage the problems associated with the information 
and requirement management but it is a difficult task to implement into the system. 
 
The focus of this thesis is: 
 
1. To examine the implementation process of a requirement management system 
(RM system), which is the first step towards an information management system 
(PLM system) at VCC.  
2. To examine factors leading to the success of the change management project.  
 
The delimiters for this thesis managed to keep within the scope of EE development at 
VCC. The definition of PLM is as follows: 
 
“Product lifecycle management is an integrated, information-driven approach to all 
aspects of a product's life - from its design inception through its manufacture, 
deployment and maintenance, culminating in its removal from service and final disposal.” 
[PLM Development Consortium, University of Michigan, 2007]

1.1. Background 
In the automotive industry, the demands of an information management are immense. 
Today, designers within EE development at VCC work with textual documents when 
handling requirements and other types of product information. The volume of documents 
to be dealt with is great. There is a need to change the manual working process into a 
computerised environment. During 2006, a global project called VSEM was begun at 
VCC; its objective was to develop methods and tools for designers within EE development 
at FMC. Model Based Electrical Engineering Development (MBEED) is an earlier VCC 
project initiated to deal with the development of new system solutions for employees. 
Both these projects have been used as a basis for this thesis.  Furthermore, MBEED is a 
project within EE development at VCC focusing on an introduction of an information 
management system within a smaller area in the organisation. A study has been carried 
out to analyse the advantages and disadvantages of this project [Malvius; Redell; Ritzén, 
2006].  
 
Today, research and development (R&D) departments within FMC are working with 
different kinds of systems and documents managing information and requirement 
management.  There are no common databases where information can be handled and 
where information from the whole development lifecycle can be found. Today, the 
finished product is documented and there are no opportunities to find the iterative work 
during the development process. Hopefully, the strive towards a common PLM system 
should create more effective requirement management, information management, report 
management, tracking of product documents and that information will be shared and 
reused within the global FMC organisation (between the automotive brands). 
 
The development of products, which have high software content, such as in the 
automotive industry, makes information exchanges difficult because of its complexity. 
The automotive industry is heading towards a paradigm shift to use systems containing a 
higher electronics and software content, which put greater demands on the development 
processes and the system solutions that support information and requirement 
management. Similarly, complex development puts new demands on the integration 
aspect between departments and disciplines within the automotive industry.  
1.2. Presentation of the company 
“VCC's vision is to become the worlds most desired and successful premium car brand. 
Their mission is to create the safest most exciting car experience for modern families. 
The name Volvo comes from the Latin verb meaning to roll. Before it adorned the first 
Volvo car in 1927, it was used as a brand name for ball bearings. The symbol for Volvo's 
cars was the iron symbol, a circle with a diagonal arrow extending from the upper right 
side of the circle. The idea was to associate Volvos with Swedish steel, renowned for its 
durability. Since then, the iron symbol has been synonymous with Volvo throughout the 
world. For VCC, the modernised logo also represents the company's undertakings in the 
fields of safety, quality and design. As of 2006, the iron symbol is the shared symbol of 
both VCC and AB Volvo.” [volvocars.com, 2007]

1.3. Problem description 
It is difficult to succeed with IT implementations and in this case, trying to implement it 
within FMC puts great demands on the change management project (IT project) because 
of the complex global perspectives. Many areas can fail during the changeover and there 
are many employees involved which makes it even more complex. This thesis provides 
an observation of VCC and a large part of the work has been to find out attitudes and 
viewpoints of employees regarding an introduction of a new IT tool. An important factor 
for this work was when interviewing employees at VCC, to allow them time to consider 
the implementation process. Employee participation plays a large role in the change 
management process. Being able to obtain employee's points of view is important to be 
able to attain successful results. To obtain factors that can improve the system 
introduction and acquire guidelines of the process in theory, from employees concerned, 
from lessons learned (from three earlier projects within VCC) and from the point of view 
of the author are all important tasks.   
1.4. Purpose and objectives 
The overall objective of this thesis is divided into two parts: 
 
1. To find out criteria/factors leading to a successful introduction of an information 
management system in EE development at VCC. 
2. To develop an implementation process for a requirement management system for 
EE development at VCC. This is the first step towards a PLM system. 
 
Essential tasks within this thesis were to gather theoretical information, lessons learned 
and employee interviews within EE development. There is a lot that has been written 
about the change management process when introducing a PLM system but there is not a 
lot of literature about the connection and specific needs for EE development. It is 
essential to find out the employees’ perspectives and attitudes towards the change. 
Similarly, 
gathering 
lessons 
learned 
from 
three 
earlier 
projects 
within 
VCC; 
CAD/CAM/CAE PIM Next Generation (C3PNG), MBEED and Ford Design Verification 
System (eFDVS) was done. All three projects have managed introductions of either an 
information management system or a requirement management system. Two of the 
projects; MBEED and eFDVS, have been studied through reports [Malvius; Redell; Ritzén, 
2006] & [Lundgren; Nilsson, 2004]. Project C3PNG has been studied through interviews. 
1.5. Delimiters 
The delimiters for this thesis managed to keep within the scope of EE development at 
VCC. The focus of the study will be the implementation process of a requirement 
management system at VCC.

2.  Methodology 
In this chapter, the work procedures for the thesis are described. This chapter will 
provide the reader with a clearer understanding to the method selected for this research. 
2.1. A case study 
A case study can be both qualitative and quantitative [Gummesson, 2004]. Case study 
research means, just as the name indicates, to study one or several cases to find 
something out. A case study can be carried out through one specific case, a single case, 
or through several cases - multiple cases [Yin, 2003]. The research method used in this 
study is a single case study with qualitative research interviews supported by literature.  
The aim of this method is to attain a deeper understanding of the interviewee from 
different points of view. Kvale [1983] defines the qualitative research interview as an 
interview with the purpose of gathering descriptions of the real life of the interviewee 
with respect to interpretation and the meaning of the phenomena described. The 
objectives of this case study are; to gather information about employees in other 
projects within VCC and the view of supporting literature on an implementation process 
of an information management system within EE development. In addition, these were 
used to establish criteria in order to become more successful with the change project.  
2.1.1. 
Interviews  
This case study has been collated by semi-structured interviews within VCC supported by 
literature [Lantz, 1993]. The interviews were conducted by Sara Molneryd and Dag 
Bergsjö, PhD student at Chalmers University of Technology, or Diana Malvius, PhD 
student at KTH. The interviews have been made in an open-minded and discursive 
manner to get a better insight into their work processes at VCC. Generally, the objects 
for interviews have been selected through recommendations from other employees. 
Additional interview objects have been randomly selected. To attain a wide range of 
views, it has been essential to find interview objects within the whole organisation for EE 
development. The interview objects have represented all divisions and levels within EE 
development. On average, the interviews spanned for about 45-60 minutes. Interview 
guides (see Appendix 1) provided support for the researchers during the interviews. A 
semi-structured interview gave the interviewee the freedom to decide what should be 
discussed within the framework of the topic chosen by the researchers [Lantz, 1993]. 
This means that the interview is structured through the interview guide, although the 
order, and to what extent the subject is discussed may be decided by the interviewee. 
The interview guide has been established on the basis of theory and problem description. 
For a compilation of the interview objects, see Figure 1.

All interviews were documented using an MP3 recorder in order to help the interviewers 
to focus on the interview rather than on note-taking. Furthermore, having two 
interviewers attend reduced the risk of forgetting important questions and guaranteed 
that the answers were understood correctly. The analysis consisted of finding key words 
from the interviews and these key words were later connected to each other to identify 
patterns as a basis for the results. Other important sources for the study have been a 
couple of workshops with suppliers of PLM systems and general discussions with 
employees at VCC. 
2.1.2. 
Quality of the interviews 
A crucial factor for the quality of an analysis or a report is the quality of the original 
interviews. The interview is the actual raw data for the subsequent analysis. Kvale 
[1997] has set up different quality criteria for an interview that can be used as a 
guideline in order to provide interview quality. Some examples of criteria are; short 
interview questions which entail lengthy responses, interpret and analyse the interview 
as a whole already during the actual interview and ensure the interview is self-
explanatory. These guidelines were taken into account during the interviews conducted in 
this study. 
2.1.3. 
Creating a theoretical framework 
The theoretical framework of the study has been produced through a literature review 
using the objectives that the material will be valid, relevant and reliable. Material from 
earlier projects (MBEED and eFDVS) at VCC has been studied. Similarly, considerable 
amounts of supporting literature relevant to the paper’s objectives have also been 
examined. Key words have been used when searching for relevant information; 
information management, requirement management, PLM, product development, 
complex, IT systems and implementation processes.  
2.2. Validity and reliability  
“Reliability is the extent to which an experiment, test, or any measuring procedure yields 
the same results for repeated trials.” [www.colostate.edu, 2007]  
 
“Validity refers to the degree to which a study accurately reflects or assesses the specific 
concept that the researcher is attempting to measure. While reliability is concerned with 
the accuracy of the actual measuring instrument or procedure, validity is concerned with 
the study's success at measuring what the researchers set out to measure.” [Ibid]  
 
The situation of the interviewee cannot be repeated, so it is extremely difficult, in this 
case study, to improve the reliability of the interviews. The purpose of doing qualitative 
research interviews is to describe the real lives and the actual work situation of the 
interviewees at VCC. To provide a common overview of the phenomenon studied 
different people from different levels and areas at VCC were interviewed. 
 
The author has conduced equally to the semi-structured interviews, literature study and 
to the analysis of the interviews, to improve the validity of the study. Consequently, to 
decrease subjective interpretations and confirm that correct understanding of the 
answers has been achieved. During the whole working process, there has been 
continuous verification through discussions with employees who are fully involved and 
aware of all aspects in the problem area. 
 
The results should be put into the context of EE development at VCC but this does not 
eliminate an adjustment for the implementation process within FMC. The implementation 
 
 
16 
process is suitable for a requirement management system introduction and to apply the 
implementation process for additional PLM functions will probably be successful.  
 
 
 
 
 
17 
3. Theoretical framework 
This chapter aims at introducing the theoretical framework of the study. The first part 
handles product development and after those statements of requirement management 
and information management and also how PLM related material is documented.  
3.1. Product development 
Most companies have a product development model, in the case of VCC - GPDS (Global 
Product Development System), to provide the company develops, manufactures and sells 
products. In [Ulrich; Eppinger, 2003] the product development model is defined as “the 
sequences of steps or activities, which an enterprise employs to conceive, design, and 
commercialise a product”.  
 
According to Johansson [2000] a process contains the sequence of steps or activities that 
transform a set of inputs into a set of outputs. A process model is used to formally 
describe how the product development process can be carried out in a company. A 
product development model typically consists of six phases; planning, concept 
development, system-level design, detailed design, testing and refinement, and 
production ramp-up. Figure 2 illustrates a model of the product development by Ulrich 
and Eppinger [1995].  According to Malvius, Redell and Ritzén the automotive industry 
has still not been able to fully adapt its development process to the specific needs of EE 
and software development.

To make competitive cars in the future, the product development process in the 
automotive industry has to be more efficient and structured [Malvius; Redell; Ritzén, 
2006]. According to Dag Bergsjö in the article A common database will make better 
products [Inventor & designer, 2006], a better overview of information and requirements 
will lead to better products in the future, new products have to be developed in a better 
and more efficient way to be competitive. As Bergsjö intend in the article, a PLM system 
will improve the product development process to make better products in a shorter time 
period.

3.2. Ford’s global product development process 
According to VCC´s intranet the product development process within FMC is called the 
Global Product Development System (GPDS). As mentioned on the intranet, the new 
process will enable more effective sharing of technology between the brands and 
promote commonality according to written information within the area. [VCC intranet, 
2007] 
 
GPDS integrates all global brands into a single common product creation process. This 
will enables each brand to reach world class levels for stand-alone, joint and shared 
technology programs. The forerunner to GPDS, at VCC, is Volvo Product Development 
System (VPDS) and the main difference when changing from VPDS to GPDS is the 
synergies in achieving one common development system within FMC. According to the 
web site “A new process leads to one common language regarding development 
procedures, one common program logic and better efficiency in cross-brand development 
with one shared technology process aligned with the vehicle programmes”. [Ibid] 
3.3. Complex product development 
A vital part in this thesis is to learn about the complex development process which the 
automotive industry is related to. Ulrich and Eppinger [2003] talks about different kinds 
of products in the book, Product design and development. One of these products is the 
complex system.  
 
“Large scale products such as automobiles and aeroplanes are complex systems 
comprised of many interacting subsystems and components”  
[Ulrich; Eppinger, 2003] 
 
The term complex system has no precise definition. A complex system is explained below 
on the basis of two experts in the area. 
 
"A complex system is a highly structured system, which shows structure with variations" 
[Goldenfeld; Kadanoff, 1999] 
 
"A complex system is one in which there are multiple interactions between many 
different components" 
[Rind, 1999] 
3.4. Integrated product development 
When handling information and requirement management within EE development there 
are fundamentals dealing with the integration aspect from a mechatronic viewpoint 
[Bergsjö, 2006]. Year 1976 a theoretical approach was developed by Olsson in order to 
coordinate and systematizes activities within product development under a procedural 
approach. An important part of this procedural approach was the iterations between 
different activities. This approach was called integrated product development (IPD) and 
was in the 1980´s refined by Andreasen and Hein. The approach aims to increase 
efficiency in product development by including more parallel activities and a higher 
degree of co-operation between functions, levels and individuals in an enterprise [Olsson, 
1976] & [Andreasen, 1980].  
 
According to Johansson and Ottosson [2000] the integrated approach to product 
development also has implications when considering new technology. “More disciplines 
 
 
19 
need to be concurrently involved in the choice and implementation of a new technology, 
especially a new process technology, which complicates the adoption process. If this 
complexity is handled properly, the integrative approach also offers a good opportunity 
for a more rapid implementation.” [Ibid] This is an important fact which is handled in this 
thesis. 
3.5. Information management 
It is necessary for an organisation to think through its information model and to take 
control of the information in order to reach successful information management. The 
growing needs of information management within EE development is one important 
factor that calls for an updated development process and improved tool support [Malvius; 
Redell; Ritzén, 2006].  
 
Information management of products with high mechanical content has strong support in 
established technologies such as product lifecycle management systems.  
 
“Information management is the handling of information acquired by one or many 
disparate sources in a way that optimises access by all who have a share in that 
information or a right to that information”  
[www.wikipedia.org, 2006] 
 
According to wikipedia.org [2006] information were largely limited to files, file 
maintenance, and life cycle management of paper and a small number of other media 
during the 1970's. In the later 1970´s the job of information management took on a new 
light. No longer was information management a simple job that could be performed by 
almost anyone. An understanding of the technology and the theory behind it became 
necessary, as information was stored electronically more and more. By the late 1990's 
when information was regularly disseminated via computers and other electronic devices, 
information managers found themselves assigned with increasingly complex devices. 
Using the latest tools available, information management has become a powerful 
resource for organisations. [Ibid, 2006] 
 
According to Lundberg [2004] inefficiency in the organisation often depends on bursts of 
correct information, in a reasonable format though not always delivered at the right time. 
Lundberg means that a lot of time is spent searching for information and producing 
information. Apart from the pure art of compiling information, there are very few aids 
available that aid distribution and the ability to analyse the information. [Lundberg, 
2004]  
 
“Information management at companies devoted to mechatronic product development is 
a cumbersome task due to the complexity of product definitions and supporting system 
architectures” 
 [Hallin; Zimmerman; Malmqvist, 2004] 
 
According to Hallin, Zimmerman and Malmqvist [2004] the technology domains 
constituting mechatronics usually have their own courses of action, culture, supporting, 
information systems etc., which call for more inter-domain integration. Large companies 
working with mechatronic product development typically have many computer systems 
to administer the new product definitions. According to Bergsjö, Malmqvist and Ström 
[2006] the arrangement of these systems frequently constitutes complex and 
heterogeneous network architectures. They mean that “A bottleneck for effective 
collaborative and concurrent development, amongst different engineering domains, is the 
ability to integrate information contents and systems. To manage information in modern 
product development companies is an awkward task due to the multiplicity of roles 
involved, processes, information systems and types of product data managed. As 
 
 
20 
software and electronics have entered the scenes of product development the situation 
has become even more complex as more people, with a broader scope of competencies, 
are forced to work together on one single technically multi-faceted product. The 
organisational settings and development processes deployed mark an overall framework 
on how to structure information and integrate systems. Companies developing 
mechatronic products often have interfaces with other organisations, such as component 
and subsystem suppliers and service and maintenance partners. This environment, often 
referred to as the extended enterprise, calls for an effective and adaptable mechanism of 
the exchange of information and data knowledge.”  [Bergsjö, Malmqvist, Ström; 2006] 
 
In modern product design, information systems tend to play an increasingly important 
role. This has resulted in the introduction of systems that contribute to product 
development throughout its lifecycle. According to Saaksvuori and Immonen [2003] the 
number of systems adopted, in many companies, has become out of control, typically 
due to the constant addition of new tools in combination with the lack of distinct policies 
for system introduction. The UK Academy of Information Systems (UKAIS) defines 
information systems as the means by which people and organisations utilise technology, 
gather, process, store, use and disseminate information. [Ward; Peppard, 2002] 
3.6. Integration of information management  
Many large companies have rather separate processes for mechanical, electrical and 
software development. This is illustrated in the article A common database will make 
better products by Bergsjö where the ordinary way of solving information and 
requirement management are done by using two different databases. One information 
management system handling product data and another database for handling software 
configuration management (SCM) tool are usual according to Bergsjö. That means two 
different databases in perhaps two different worlds. According to Bergsjö, the 
fundamentals of electrical, mechanical and software engineers differ, but they have a 
common need to share their information.  
 
“Tighter integration has emerged through an underlying requirement to produce products 
that utilise the full potential of all three disciplines, and projects for integration domain-
specific PDM and SCM solutions which are underway at many major manufacturing 
firms.”  
[Bergsjö, 2006] 
 
System engineers work in specialised system engineering (SE) tools for requirement 
management. Hardware engineers work in product data management systems (PDM), 
software engineers in SCM and production in enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems. 
According to Bergsjö [2006], an environment where information is spread in different 
domain-specific data sources is consequently created. This situation has raised the need 
for a common approach to data management in product development gather the 
information generated into one whole. According to Bergsjö it is not easy to choose the 
best solution for the task and the progress towards integrated PLM solutions able to 
manage mechatronic development processes has been slow.  
 
In the case of SCM and PDM integration there are a number of possible general 
approaches to how this can be done [Saaksvuori; Immonen, 2003]. In the paper, 
Architectures for mechatronic product data integration in PLM systems, four major 
approaches for performing PDM and SCM integration are presented [Bergsjö; Malmqvist; 
Ström; 2006]. These four approaches range from the integrated approaches using a 
single PLM system to a solution where no integrating system is used at all.  According to 
the study there are advantages and disadvantages with all approaches of integration.  
 
 
21 
3.7. Requirement management 
Another large problem within the product development process is the requirements 
connected to the process.  
 
“Requirement management is the science gathering and managing user, business, 
technical and functional requirements within a product development project” 
[www.wikipedia.org, 2006] 
 
In systems engineering, a requirement can be a description of what a system must do. 
This type of requirement specifies something that the delivered system must be able to 
do. Another type of requirement specifies something about the system itself, and how 
well it performs its functions. Such requirements are often called non-functional 
requirements, performance requirements or quality of service requirements. Availability, 
testability, maintainability and ease-of-use are all examples of such requirements. [Ibid] 
 
As mentioned in the introduction cross-brand co-operation, as the case in FMC, leads to 
difficulties when employees have to communicate requirements and other product 
information within the organisation. So, the development of more efficient IT systems to 
support information and requirement management is an essential part in the future for 
the automotive industry.  
3.8. Product lifecycle management  
According to Saaksvuori and Immonen [2003] PLM refers to the wider frame of reference 
of PDM, especially to the lifecycle perspective of information management.  
 
“PLM is a group of systems and methods with which the development, manufacture and 
management of products is made possible at all the stages of the product lifecycle” 
[Cimdata, 2007] 
 
When introducing new PLM systems, general information about product lifecycle 
management has to be properly managed. In mechatronic development, some of the 
most commonly used data management tools are product data management (PDM), 
software configuration management (SCM), system engineering (SE) applications, 
enterprise resource planning (ERP) and computer aided design (CAD) systems. All these 
systems can be connected into a PLM system. Even if these systems support the process 
in different phases they all contribute to the definition of the final mechatronic product. 
Information systems, like a PLM system, are generally connected to the company 
intranet. [Hallin; Zimmerman; Malmqvist, 2004] 
 
According to Ryman.se the strength of PLM are the synergy effects that are shown when 
several functions are combined. A product structure that is linked to the documents and 
the work flow, makes it possible for a project manager to directly see which detailed 
components that are still not validated, and moreover to  look directly at the documents 
that describe the product. According to the web site most companies that make 
investments in PLM systems today, buy a commercial system and adapt it to pursue their 
own best interests. [www.ryman.se, 2006] 
3.9. Implementing a product lifecycle management 
system 
There are many articles about the following issue: How do you implement a PLM system? 
Guidelines have been found from different kinds of literature and are summarised further 
 
 
22 
in this chapter. A PLM project is never a question of only a few months, so it is worth 
spending time on decent preparation [Saaksvuori; Immonen, 2003]. A hastily prepared 
development project always carries a greater risk of failure. According to Sutinen [2004] 
everyone in the change management project must clearly see the reasons for creating 
the system from the beginning. Even though the PLM system itself takes on a central role 
during the project, it is worth remembering that it is only an application meant to 
facilitate the "real" work [Sutinen, 2004]. 
 
Experience shows that the time and resources needed for the deployment of the system 
in a company can vary from several months to several years [Saaksvuori; Immonen, 
2003]. The time varies depending on the size of the company, the approach taken 
toward the project, and the system chosen (e.g., a standard software package versus 
tailoring). The PLM system will never be entirely "ready". Every year, in the field of 
information technology will bring a lot pressure for change and development. There will 
also be a lot to further develop in the company’s internal operations. The company must 
remain ready to react quickly to change in a world that is constantly changing. [Ibid] 
 
The following section is divided into three different parts: 
 
1. Pre-action.  
2. Action.  
3. Post action. 
 
In addition, guidelines will be listed under all headings with measures leading to better 
success of an IT system implementation, such as PLM. The guidelines recommend actions 
when handling each phase of the project.  
3.9.1. 
Pre-action 
Keep in mind   
 
The need for change may come up in several different ways, likewise, understanding and 
accepting the need for change. Problems related to product data and lifecycle 
management may trouble the company for a long time before the tolerance level is 
surpassed [Saaksvuori; Immonen, 2003]. At some stage, it will be seen that the 
company can no longer continue with its present ways and work tools. In this phase of 
understanding, according to Lundberg [2004], the need for change, the key people must 
study appropriate literature on the subject; benchmarking must be done through 
attending seminars, conferences and other company visits; consultants can be used; and 
PLM system suppliers can be audited. Consequently, as much information as possible 
about the subject must be found, and the level of expertise and understanding about the 
subject must be increased in the organisation. Many alternative approaches and solutions 
should be studied. However, it is extremely important that the uppermost management 
in particular understands the significance of PLM and provides support throughout the 
project. [Lundberg, 2004] 
 
It is widely acknowledged that introducing PLM systems is a lot more difficult as 
compared with introducing ordinary support systems [Horkeby; Areblad, 1998]. The 
reason is that PLM cuts through all aspects of an organisation from the earliest 
conceptual design through the life of the product. The PLM must serve different 
shareholders with interests in different business areas. This leads to different 
expectations and training needs. A PLM system must be structured such that each 
shareholder will find it natural to add and retrieve information from the system. This is a 
goal which can not be attained without detailed understanding of all operational 
processes within an organisation. The introduction of a PLM system does, according to 
Lundberg [2004], require the organisation to resolve inconsistent terminology and 
product views to accommodate consistent data representations. Introducing PLM requires 
 
 
23 
an effort encompassing all aspects of an organisation where top level management 
support is vital. [Lundberg, 2004] 
 
According to Johansson [2000] the benefits of a new system or process only come true 
on a large-scale plan if people and organisations realise the significance of the project 
and change their way of thinking and operate in accordance with the new models. To 
promote change, it is essential to show the reasons for it and advantages to be gained, 
and to draw up an implementation plan to the correct precision level [Ibid]. 
 
“Resistance to change usually arises from failure in these matters, or from uncertainty 
and ignorance”.  
[Johansson, 2000] 
 
The key points of managing change at a personal level in a system and process change 
project is to support individual learning and commitment to the work [Beskow, 2000].  
 
“Motivation must arise from within the individual. External motivation, such as a wage 
increase, does not produce such good results. Daily work has to be sensible and 
satisfying. Commitment represents an internal factor of motivation. The worker's 
commitment is directed by needs, values and beliefs. The values of the company should 
be in harmony with the worker's personal values, so that he can regard the commitment 
as sensible.”  
[Beskow, 2000] 
 
According to Carlsson [2006] the most critical factor leading to success is the 
involvement of the people within the organisation. Top level management needs to 
understand the concepts in PLM to connect them to the defined business goals. They 
must understand the concepts well enough to be able to set the goals and communicate 
with the next level of management. The next levels of management have to understand 
and how to implement them and attain localised benefits. The task for this level of 
management is to create a common introduction strategy to guide the introduction that 
will be the basis for different introduction plans for the business areas selected.  
 
Main tasks  
 
Define a PLM roadmap; a company should first determine the current situation in the 
organisation in terms of PLM maturity and alignment [Batenburg; Helms; Versendaal, 
2006]. During this part of the project a specific strategy has to be chosen. Discussions 
about top-down, bottom-up or inside-out strategies are important [Earl, 1989] & [Brandt 
et al., 1998] & [Nilsson, 1991]. As previously stated, this thesis covers two projects 
working within the same area at VCC; the eFDVS project and the MBEED project. These 
two projects had entirely different strategies during their implementation process and 
knowledge and experiences from both projects are taken into account in this thesis 
[Lundgren; Nilsson, 2004] & [Malvius; Redell; Ritzén, 2006]. It is usually good to divide 
the project into several subprojects, especially if the project includes system start-ups in 
several different locations [Saaksvuori; Immonen, 2003]. It can be very difficult to 
introduce all system functionalities to all offices at the same time. It is important to make 
a comprehensive progress plan. In this progress plan, a schedule is drawn up for all 
individual projects and their contents. According to Beskow [2000] it is extremely 
important, in large projects, to separate the technical implementation and deployment of 
the system into separate projects. A successful feasibility study should contain at least 
one pilot project. There are substantial benefits to be gained by this, including 
verification of the solution realisation, feed-back from the rest of the organisation and 
realistic schedules for a full-scale implementation. [Beskow, 2000] 
 
A needs analysis focusing on obscurities, such as: What is the ambition for the PLM 
project? Is the purpose to quickly increase efficiency of existing routines, or is the aim to 
 
 
24 
support future business goals? In this phase, a specification considering system 
requirements has to be done, using content, such as system and function needs. It is 
beneficial to grade the needs and classify them under labels, e.g., absolute need, need 
and desirable. The final step is to work out specifications arising from PLM related needs. 
[Cimdata, 1997] 
 
Working in a project provides opportunities for a goal-focused procedure. When 
implementing a support tool, the goals must include both corporate goals and 
implementation goals, i.e., implementers as well as users of the tool should know why 
the tool is being implemented and what needs are driving the implementation process in 
the organisation. Goals should be clear, concrete, realistic and shared. Clear means that 
the goals should be easy to understand and have a content that people can relate to in 
the context of their own work. Concrete requirement specifies an assessment of whether 
those goals can be achieved. Measurements, even if numbers are not possible, are 
preferred. Goals also need to be realistic, often meaning that aims should not be set too 
high, because of the risk of negative effects on self-esteem, stress, etc. Finally, goals 
must be shared; the understanding of and belief in goals must be shared by the entire 
field affected by the change. Supporting literature suggests; do not expect or promise 
miracles. [Ritzén; Beskow, 2000] 
 
Define the purpose; this is essential during pre-action in a PLM system implementation 
process. In theory [Carlsson, 2006], purpose can be divided into three different ways:  
 
1. Business effectiveness - strive for; an increased number of product lifecycle 
stages, closer and longer relationships with customers, optimising the supply 
chain, shorter time to market, lower costs, better quality and lower risks.  
2. Information effectiveness - make it easier; to find and get information needed 
from independent sources, to reuse common product information between 
different products, to improve product information sharing between all parties in 
the lifecycle and to update information.  
3. IT effectiveness - strive for; better collaboration with all business areas, better 
opportunities to access data in existing systems, easier implementation of new 
systems, easier termination of old systems and easier integration of different 
systems.  
 
Define terminology is very important, according to Ottersten and Balic [2004]. In a large 
organisation it is expected that different parts of the organisation use different 
terminology to refer to an aspect of the product or the product development process. 
Problems regarding terminology fall into two basic facets: 
 
• 
synonyms; two separate terms refer to the same concept 
• 
homonyms; the same term refers (in different contexts) to multiple concepts. 
 
The establishment of the existence of synonyms and homonyms is essential to PLM 
implementation. This does not imply that terminology must be harmonised across an 
organisation, but it must be established. In which case, the same terms are used to 
identify different concepts. [Carlsson, 2006]  
 
A PLM system is only a tool that can be used to bring system and discipline to the 
present processes at the company [Saaksvuori; Immonen, 2003]. An absence of 
discipline in the process is often a large problem. A few examples of this are: 
 
• 
lack of guidance and documentation for new employees 
• 
lack of instructions to use IT systems 
• 
unclear understanding of the overall picture and meaning of the process 
• 
unclear division of responsibilities between different departments 
• 
alternative ways of performing tasks 
 
 
25 
• 
no management for different documentation revisions and variations  
• 
no management for different item revisions and variations. 
 
It requires a careful survey of the processes and objectives related to product data 
management. In other words, a company has to know its own situation; it has to be able 
to set clear targets for the project and it has to know what it wants to develop and how. 
According to Saaksvuori and Immonen [2003] there are no ready answers available to 
these questions either in the system suppliers´ transparencies or from PLM systems. 
[Saaksvuori; Immonen, 2003] 
 
Core information used can be identified via the input and outputs in the process model 
and is encoded and structured in an information model. According to Carlsson [2006] 
information models are not structured for implementation in computer systems; so, 
Carlsson means that there is a need to transform information model structures into 
equivalent computer system-specific representations, i.e., a data model (meta model). 
An information model is system-independent while a data model is tailored for 
implementation in a specific computer system. [Carlsson, 2006] 
 
Choose a system; this is an obvious part involved in pre-action [Saaksvuori; Immonen, 
2003]. An unprejudiced examination of the supplier alternatives might conclude that 
systems and suppliers suitable for this particular company are in short supply. 
Commercial negotiations with the system supplier can last for months. Preparing the 
foundations for a selection will not be wasted. The phases involved in choosing a system 
are:  
 
• 
to become acquainted with existing systems and their suppliers 
• 
to visit companies already using the system 
• 
to choose whether to use a pilot project 
• 
to implement a pilot project 
• 
to negotiate commercial terms, project content and time schedules 
• 
to select a system. 
 
Establish meaningful and practical parameters to measure. A vital part is to establish 
meaningful parameters to measure. It is good to think of this part when planning so it is 
easy to follow up later on in the process. [Balic; Ottersten, 2004] 
 
Important selections  
 
When choosing a system, it is possible to go down two very different paths: 
 
1. Do not customise. Make direct use of existing features. 
2. Customise the software to match requirements. 
 
This decision usually has a considerable effect upon the development of the project 
because it very largely decides the amount of implementation and maintenance work 
required as well as the cost of support. It might also set restraints upon the future use of 
the program. Customisation is expensive. In addition to the direct costs, indirect costs 
often appear when upgrading to a new version of a customised commercial system. In 
order to preserve the customisations in the new version of the base program, it might be 
necessary to make laborious and possibly expensive changes to the customisations and 
to the interfaces created for other systems. [Saaksvuori; Immonen, 2003]  
 
This point is worth considering, because the system selected will be in use for a long time 
and the world can change considerably even within a five-year period. Extensive 
customisation of existing software can make upgrading to a new version a very laborious 
task. This risk is particularly evident in large scale customization, for instance, when 
modifying data models. One should consider the following points [Ibid]: 
 
 
26 
 
• 
the principal market of the PLM software manufacturer, the software product’s 
roadmap or development plan, and the software company’s vision for the future 
• 
the software’s functional and technical features, its limitations, architecture and 
scalability 
• 
the level of integration 
• 
the amount of implementation work and the time required  
• 
ease of maintenance 
• 
ease and comfort of use 
• 
available support and other supplier services 
• 
total price for work, licenses, maintenance, hardware, acquisition of expertise.  
3.9.2. 
Action 
Keep in mind  
 
This is the realisation stage of the project - the start of the PLM system itself. In other 
words, the beginning of production use can be handled, and is often best handled, phase 
by phase. One software sector at a time can be deployed. Phasing can also be done office 
by office or country by country. When people begin to use a new style of software, pay 
special attention to ensure that old habits are not retained. It is all the better if the old 
system can simply be switched off. Parallel approaches cause confusion and slow down 
the process of getting used to the new system. [Saaksvuori; Immonen, 2003] 
 
A PLM project is primarily neither an IT project nor a system project, but above all a 
change project, and one that often affects a large part of the company's staff. In order to 
succeed it requires a comprehensive change in the organisation, and a new way of 
thinking, working and sharing information and expertise. [Ibid] Information has become 
the most important success factor for companies. According to Lundberg [2004] one of 
the biggest risks, traditionally, in the successful realisation of these projects has been the 
defensive participation of the organisation and bad arrangement of communication in 
carrying through the change processes. An important matter, when regarding the 
communication process when managing a project which affects many people, is how 
people interpret information. Many interesting aspects are discussed in the book, 
Communication and conflict handling [1998]. 
 
A PLM application may affect the work of hundreds of people. If people from those parts 
of the organisation most affected by the change are not represented in the building and 
planning of the system at an early enough stage, the risk of resistance to change grows 
significantly. Real change in the organisation and working habits take place only when 
new operational models, processes and systems, and the reasons for using them, have 
been explained to those affected. At the beginning of the project, it will be worth 
estimating what subjects are critical from the stance of internalising change. Employees 
should be told in advance of the scope, objectives, activities and updates, and admit 
change will occur. [Nah; Lau, 2001] 
 
Main tasks  
 
Use pilots to test each area of implementation [www.ryman.se, 2007] & [Beskow, 2000]. 
The pilot project will verify that the technical concepts function, and that desired work 
methods and flows function as intended. The first information will be to draft a detailed 
specification about the system selected. The work will be based on the original 
requirement specification. After writing the new specification the supplier probably needs 
to carry out certain adaptations of the system, in order to provide the best possible 
conditions for the test period. The participants will be limited, but on the other hand large 
enough to ensure that their overall impressions are of a satisfactory amount so that they

can be used as a basis for decisions on whether to continue with the system or not. 
[www.ryman.se, 2007] 
 
Education and training of the potential users plays a large role in establishing PLM 
throughout the organisation. All potential users should receive some training. Different 
training courses are needed for different workers and user groups. [Saaksvuori; 
Immonen, 2003] For example, the company will have both producers and users of 
information. Depending on the user's role, the investment in training can range from 
days to weeks. Technically speaking, the learning process can be fast. From a technical 
viewpoint, software can be learned from general software manuals. In practice, the 
difficulties met with in training are greater because employees must learn exactly how 
this specific company will use the software. It is rare for much to be invested in training. 
On the contrary, in most cases the need for education is badly underestimated. [Beskow, 
2000] 
 
User training is preferably split into at least two parts; production use and on-the-job 
training. The training programme should be focused on practical work with several 
examples, taken from ongoing operations in the company. The examples must be chosen 
with care. The examples should both be easy and non-theoretical, so as not to "scare off" 
users.  The training period should preferably end with a short discussion of the required 
or desired customisation and tailoring for an individual, group and company level that 
has been identified by the users during the training period. User-acceptance of a PLM 
system is to a large extent based on realising the personal benefits to be gained. In 
general, the users asked for training that was focused on their immediate needs, but 
they also desire “shortcuts” in the use of the PLM, i.e., individual customisation and 
tailoring. A general section has to be included in user-training. The general section 
should describe the system architecture and the options of tailoring the system to the 
user's level as well as for a group and company level. [Saaksvuori; Immonen, 2003] 
3.9.3. 
Post action  
According to Lundberg [2004], there are different ways of measuring the effectiveness of 
an IT tool introduction. Similarly, Balic and Ottersten [2004] discuss a way of measuring 
the effects in the follow-up phase of the project. From a general point of view, it is 
relatively difficult to measure the efficiency of a new IT tool but these two books manage 
the problem fairly well.

4. Results 
This section is divided into four parts; interviews with designers, interviews with 
managers, lessons learned from the C3PNG project and an implementation process of a 
requirement management system developed by Sara Molneryd.  
4.1. Interviews with designers 
This part handled the interviews with designers within EE development at VCC. The 
interviews focused on  
 
• 
work routines 
• 
information and requirement management 
• 
work processes 
• 
the implementation process of a new IT tool  
• 
discussions about the future within EE development.  
4.1.1. 
Information and requirement management 
Today, information and requirement management at VCC is a troublesome area. 
According to designers, there is not an integrated tool environment and the information 
management process is very difficult to use, confusing and time-consuming. There are 
too many different kinds of systems that the designers have to start for the daily work, 
each morning. Today, designers search for relevant information through verbal 
communication, mail and telephone calls and it takes a lot of time and manual work is 
inefficient.  
 
“All designers are fixers”  
[Designer, 2006] 
 
Currently, requirement management is generally handled through textual documents and 
systems, such as Word and Excel. Many of the designers say that the big problem with 
information and requirement management has been known for a long time. According to 
designers, attempts to solve the problem have been done but it has taken a long time for 
top management to pay attention to the problem. The situation for designers at present 
is a heavy work load which is unstructured and involves a lot of administration.   
 
“We work with totally wrong tools and the systems and working processes ought to be 
much more efficient.” 
[Designer, 2006] 
 
“Lead-times will be reduced if we work with the right work processes and tools when 
handling requirements.” 
[Designer, 2006] 
 
One employee said that there should be positive effects if a change in the information 
and requirement management work process is implemented, which should already be 
seen when a forecast is conducted. There is a feeling of frustration within the 
organisation when discussing designers' situation. Today many designers work in 
different ways and a homogeneous work process has to be created. Support methods are 
needed as well as an overall control when handling requirements and information. Many 
designers talk about too much administration and unnecessary work procedures.  
 
 
 
 
29 
“The more work tasks, the more friction.” 
[Designer, 2006] 
 
Today, it is easy to miss requirements and it is very hard to follow the course of events 
when handling requirement management. According to designers, copying and pasting 
information when handling requirements ought to be prohibited.  
 
“At present, 75% of the requirements are unconfirmed.”  
[Designer, 2006] 
 
There are some specific uncertainties when handling requirements today at VCC, in no 
specific order 
 
• 
Which requirements are updated? 
• 
Which requirements are current? 
• 
Who is the requirement owner? 
• 
Who is responsible for verification?  
• 
What detail level is correct? 
• 
Why is the requirement written? 
• 
Which information connected to the requirements is important? 
• 
Which requirements are agreed? 
 
Problems related to requirement management also include how to reuse solutions and 
documents. The information about requirements is unclear and the level of detail has to 
be defined according to designers. It is also difficult to separate requirements from 
divergence in their daily work. 
 
Needs which are related to a new work method and a new IT system follow according to 
designers wishes, see Figure 3. Needs are divided into three areas in order of 
precedence; absolute needs, needs and desirable needs. An explanation of Figure 3 will 
follow.

4.1.2. 
Work processes 
“A huge number of designers need a more efficient work method and a more efficient 
system for handling requirements and information.”  
[Designer, 2006] 
 
According to designers, there are many different work processes when handling 
requirement and information within the organisation.  
 
“There are just as many work processes as designers.”  
[Designer, 2006] 
 
Many interviewed stated that today, many test and write requirements differently and 
that is not acceptable. If a system handling requirements should be introduced within EE 
development there ought to be a course in requirement writing connected to the 
introduction.  It is fundamental to begin with improving the quality of the requirements.  
 
The work processes when handling requirement and information management are not 
documented and it makes it very difficult for new employees. If a new system for 
requirement management is introduced it must be well-defined, restricted and 
information about how to managed the system has to be documented. Some specific 
work methods are essential. 
 
Work methods are important and they should be suited for each role and responsibility 
area within the organisation. The designers also mention how important their work 
processes are when developing a new IT tool. A starting point must be the current work 
process and the development phase of the new IT system has to start dealing with that 
point. If the project team works with methods of how to manage the system the 
designers think that if a change is implemented it will decrease the bulk of work and end 
users will be more motivated.  A more structured work method will lead to a better 
overview and reduce duplicated work. As one designer said when discussing work 
processes: 
“It will be hard to survive a new platform project.” 
[Designer, 2006] 
4.1.3. 
Purpose of introducing an information management 
system (PLM system) 
The general purpose of introducing an information management system is, in substance, 
to achieve a more efficient way of working. An essential part to handle when introducing 
an information management system is the level of standardisation or customisation. To 
bear in mind during the process is that the designers view the level of system restriction 
in different ways.  
 
“The system must be clearly defined and also specify how it should be used. Enterprising 
engineers can diffuse the tool which can be hazardous – from that point of view; some 
specific functionality has to be frozen.” 
[Designer, 2006] 
 
Other designers mean that if the system has be to restricted and hard to work with, the 
end users will omit using it correctly and find their own work methods. Consequently, the 
most important matter when introducing a new IT system is that the system aids 
designers in their daily work and is not an obstacle to it. According to designers, a 
commonly held vision for the introduction of a new IT system for information and 
requirement management is to gain a better understanding of how other employees 
work. Many designers want to understand other people's work processes.  
 
 
31 
4.1.4. 
Implementing an information management system 
From interviews focusing on the implementation processes of IT systems, some 
guidelines considering how to carry it out have been proposed by designers at VCC.  The 
following part states the recommended guidelines for different stages of the project.  
 
The planning period has to include some specific parts that are essential. Designers hint 
at time spent on business development has to be allowed to develop in its own time and 
is necessary. Many designers indicate the significance of top management during the 
change management process. According to interviews this is because employees on a too 
low a level will not be heard in the organisation.  
 
In the planning period the project members have to have a process focus. Process focus 
means that the project has to have a close connection to reality and how the department 
works in an effective and efficient manner. Later, this will be a basis for system 
adjustment. 
 
“Be careful with the gap between reality and vision.” 
[Designer, 2006] 
 
To minimise this gap, designers have to be well informed and participate during the 
whole change process from start to finish. The designers discussed how common it is 
that change projects are believed to be the final solution to all problems, however, in 
reality it is not true. Designers also discussed how things are handled and will be 
handled. This is essential information when developing an information model. This 
information model (input and output) will later be the foundation for a support tool.  
 
Current work processes are important; as is the challenge to make these processes more 
efficient during the change project. It is vital to start with how to handle issues for 
important deliveries or drawings or other basics. It is vital that the project group works 
with the matter: What is the right and most efficient work process when handling 
information and requirements? One objective when introducing a new work method is to 
make the work processes more structured and that they are better documented. Some 
designers are quite afraid of introducing a new information management system and 
especially in the first phase of an RM system at VCC. This is because of experiences they 
have from earlier changes, with top-down approaches and standard systems within the 
company. From the designers' point of view, they recommend focusing on the current 
work situation and to find a tool which supports it.  
 
A new IT system has to be introduced through pilots with end users and level of detail as 
the main areas of focus.  
 
“The devil is in the detail.” 
[Designer, 2006] 
 
According to interviews, solving problems on a detailed level is called streamlining. An 
introduction of a new IT system starts on a small scale and with an area that has major 
issues. Time spent on the pilot is vital and it has to be allowed the time it takes to 
mature. During this phase of the introduction co-operation between users and supplier is 
vital and there has to be rapid communication links between them. The system has to be 
suited to the needs of the end users and the supplier has to handle this situation in an 
appropriate manner. Designers state that the project has to focus on the end users and 
not to loose the focus. A most vital part in this is the selection of pilots and key users. 
Both these tasks have to be considered and well-defined during the planning period of 
the project. 
 
 
 
32 
According to designers, the management role is vital during the change management 
project. Managers have to convince end users of the benefits during the implementation 
process and they have to have a good working knowledge of the change and IT system. 
Essentials for the management role are  
 
• 
to provide information about the future 
• 
to provide information about FMC focus 
• 
to provide information about the high venture 
• 
to show results in a short time  
• 
to clearly show benefits  
• 
to show a clear purpose  
• 
to remove resources 
• 
to provide support 
• 
to motivate 
• 
to be involved  
• 
to be enthusiastic. 
 
Managers have to be clear that no one can escape from using the system and show the 
end users that the system will make it much easier for the employees in their daily work. 
Consequently, vital parts connected to a manager’s responsibility during the change 
process are; to motivate, to provide information and to remove old resources.  
 
According to designers, training is vital and it must be closely observed during the 
changeover. For example, training will consist of courses, e-learning and work shops. 
Fundamental parts during training are also the key user focus, transferring data and the 
importance of good information. Designers want clear, concise and oral information. And 
many designers think that information spread by word of mouth (organic) is a factor 
leading to success. Designers view training adjusted to the needs of the individual. 
Courses can be adapted for different kinds of roles in the department. They see a need 
for a homepage with information about the project. There has to be time and resources 
specifically set aside for the training.  
 
According to designers, the training programme can consist of a short introduction, with 
information about its purpose, objectives and what the system is going to compensate. 
The purpose must be clear and connected to the interest of the end users.  
 
As a first step in the training phase, the designers want to test the system by themselves 
and as such, receive material early. After a first look at the new IT system the designers 
want to set aside time for courses, workshops and e-learning. Information about many 
unnecessary areas during the courses is forbidden; otherwise the users may lose interest 
and motivation. Concentrating on some super users is positive. Issues, such as 
transferring data, have to be decided before starting the training phase. The end users 
have to have support regarding data transfer. Important is, when introducing and 
running a pilot there has to be time set aside for transferring requirements.  
 
The follow-up part of the roll out is vital and it has to be handled in project planning. 
According to designers, there are three vital issues to handle; support, follow-ups and 
key users. They recommend a weekly follow-up meeting. It is vital to follow-up that all 
users work in the same way and really follow the work methods documented for the new 
system. Support is important and the project team has to plan this at the beginning of 
the project. It is desirable to have a forum and seminars for posing queries regarding the 
change and the new work method after the implementation process is over. It is 
important to provide sufficient support for queries and deal with dissatisfied users when 
the new system is installed and ready to use. 
 
 
33 
4.1.5. 
Unsuccessful IT implementations 
Designers believe that the reason why IT system implementations often fail is due to 
dependence on specific areas. Many designers illustrate this by commenting on the issue 
of top management involvement and poor distribution of information. Other comments 
about unsuccessful IT implementations are  
 
• 
no problems are solved, the approach is too general  
• 
insufficient focus on the end user  
• 
not working on details 
• 
unclear objectives, purpose and vision 
• 
too many people involved 
• 
human error 
• 
a poor IT system (IT tool) 
• 
a dislike towards the change 
• 
an increase in tiredness of users 
• 
a sluggish system 
• 
a top-down approach 
• 
no lessons learned from earlier similar projects. 
4.1.6. 
Future 
Comments from designers regarding the future within EE development at VCC are 
illustrated in the following list 
 
• 
a more efficient way of working when handling information and requirements  
• 
better communication 
• 
a global environment for information management 
• 
model based development 
• 
a more common work process 
• 
clearly responsibilities, roles, meetings and decisions. 
 
 
34 
4.2. Interviews with managers 
This part handled the interviews with mangers within EE development at VCC. The 
interviews focused on  
 
• 
work routines 
• 
information and requirement management 
• 
work processes 
• 
the implementation process of a new IT tool  
• 
discussions about the future within EE development.  
4.2.1. 
Information and requirement management 
According to mangers the information and requirement management is not satisfactory 
within the organisation. Today, requirement management uses textual documents and 
work is time-consuming and inefficient.  
 
“It is like the Stone Age.” 
[Manger, 2006] 
 
There are too many different kinds of systems today and the IT systems are immense, 
which leads to inefficient information management. The requirements of today are often 
circumlocuted and many designers use copy and paste to make changes in the 
documents. The need for an information management system is great and many 
mangers think that this new way of working will force designers to draft better 
requirements. It is a complex product to handle and there is a lot of information and 
product data connected to the development process. Today, many mangers talk about 
the difficult procedure of finding correct and up-to-date information. Consequently, it is 
difficult to manage and gain knowledge of the system solution. According to the 
interviews, an integrated information management system ought to be satisfactory and 
important for the employees within EE development.   
 
Similarly, requirement management is unstructured and inefficient. It is hard to see 
where changes will affect the product and change tracking is difficult and 
time-consuming. Managers recommend solving this kind of problem using a simulation 
tool when handling system solutions.  
 
“There ought to be better iterative processes when handling requirement management.” 
[Manger, 2006] 
 
Some comments regarding requirement management are illustrated in following list 
 
• 
minimise copy and paste  
• 
work with old mistakes 
• 
rework 
• 
minimise duplicated work 
• 
more structure 
• 
minimise waste. 
 
There are great needs for an information management system for those who also handle 
requirements. EE development has been badly neglected regarding verification when 
handling requirements. Today, there is a poor connection between requirements and test 
methods. Analysis and verification is truly neglected within EE development and it is 
essential to start dealing with this area. An information management system can show if 
the requirements are verified and reviewed.  
 
 
35 
4.2.2. 
Work processes 
According to many mangers today, they see a great potential in changing the way of 
working when handling information and requirements. They think that the work 
processes for information and requirement management can be much more efficient. It 
will make it easier for new employees if the work method becomes more structured and 
is better documented. A vital issue, according to managers, is that the introduction of the 
new global product development system (GPDS) and the new IT system goes hand-in-
hand. Consequently, process focus is vital.  
 
There are many designers today that bypass the different systems to make work easier 
and faster. It is vital that all designers work in the same way and that the system will 
make their daily work situation easier. Many managers think that a structured work 
process will come automatically when changing systems. When regarding work 
processes, many managers think that communication, areas of responsibility and 
iterative work for requirement management have to be improved within the organisation.   
 
The work process when handling information and requirements has to be better 
digitalised and structured. It is important to start work in the same way and this will lead 
to increased efficiency. According to interviews, an information management system does 
not increase the designer’s creativity but it decreases his/her administration.  
4.2.3. 
The purpose of introducing an information management 
system (PLM system) 
There are many different purposes of introducing a new IT system. In the future, many 
managers think that the new system will lead to a better connection between 
requirement and verification, earlier verification, minimise duplicated work, better 
structure/order and show areas where such matters like deliveries, test methods and 
resources are missing.  
 
A summation of the desirable effect with the new IT system is as follows  
 
• 
better overall view 
• 
increase efficiency 
• 
increase quality  
• 
minimize waste 
• 
lower costs 
• 
do things correctly from the start 
• 
shorter lead times 
• 
integration toward a more mechatronic focus 
• 
global environment for information management 
• 
strive for model based development. 
 
Some managers are also considering access to see specifications realised and status, 
such as, review, realised and performed requirements. Higher up in the organisation 
hierarchy the purpose of the introduction focuses more on the overall view. These are 
higher quality, efficiency and lower costs. According to some managers, it is vital to 
define purpose and have a common purpose for the whole change project.  
 
“It is not obvious for designers to think of the overall view with implementation, so 
perhaps purpose connected to their work situation is quite different.” 
[Manger, 2006] 
 
 
 
 
36 
It is vital for managers within all levels in the organisation to reserve time and make 
resources available for the change. It is vital to focus on the information and also 
follow-up the project. According to managers, it is proportionately unusual to invest time 
and money in business development. It is more the product which is in focus so business 
development is passed over.  
 
“Business development plays a second role.” 
[Manger, 2006] 
 
According to managers, it is vital to see all individuals. Managers see factors for success 
in finding out end users motivation and willingness to change when changing work 
methods.  
4.2.4. 
Introducing an information management system 
According to managers, it is vital to pay attention to the end users demands. You have to 
show end users respect and understand that they are going to work in the system in the 
future. Respect toward end users means transferring resources for their disposal.  
 
“View it as a car project where all employees work together and have the same 
objectives within the project.” 
[Manger, 2006] 
 
Many mangers view pilots as a gentle introduction to a system; in such cases, end users 
can be seen and observed.  
 
“A pilot is meant to observe all users at all levels within the organisation.” 
[Manger, 2006] 
 
In the pilot runs, there has to be short communication loops between supplier and end 
user to ensure vital co-operation. It is necessary that the system will be definite and 
complete before more users become affected by its roll-out. Many talk about learning 
from earlier projects. There are lessons to be learned from other projects within the 
organisation. As one manger said: 
 
“Learning by doing.” 
[Manger, 2006] 
 
Training should consist of a lot of theory and practical work. During the practical work 
users have to work with their own cases. Many mangers do actually see the introduction 
as suitable for individuals; they see the needs of courses suited to each role and 
responsibility. Many mangers want to learn the system with end users and not through 
traditional courses.  
 
Today, many designers use the system incorrectly and they do not see the importance of 
the system. This could be improved if the user becomes more involved and receives 
better information during the introduction. The change management project has to 
identify the end users. 
 
“Better understanding leads to higher levels of usage.” 
[Manger, 2006] 
 
The individual role of managers during the implementation process as they see it is  
 
• 
to make room for the change and reserve time for this in the daily work  
• 
to make time for business development 
• 
to provide information 
 
 
37 
• 
to lead the department in the right direction 
• 
to show the advantages of the system 
• 
to motivate others 
• 
to provide support. 
 
A very important task during the change is to involve and absorb users. According to 
managers, there are so many people who possess information and knowledge within the 
organisation but have not had an opportunity to divulge this.  
 
The training programme should consist of 
   
• 
a brief and simple introduction 
• 
a brief overview of the content 
• 
a purpose definition 
• 
exactly what the system will compensate in the future 
• 
getting the material early  
• 
courses at different levels 
• 
how to transfer data 
• 
a quick and efficient implementation of the changeover; many designers do not 
want to be disturbed so you have to be aware of the short window of opportunity 
to be able to implement the changeover 
• 
increase knowledge about PLM. 
 
According to mangers, communication and information are essential parts during the 
project. To ensure that information has actually been circulated to the correct people in 
the organisation there has to be some sort of cross-check to ensure that information is 
not sent out twice. Information overflow can easily occur. Today, there is a great need 
for a better communication process within EE development. Poor communication occurs 
both between system designers and suppliers, but also within projects.  
 
During the changeover, the project ought to increase the knowledge of PLM thinking and 
information management.  
 
“If we are going towards integration-driven development process the knowledge in the 
area has to increase. Designers have to focus more on their product in its entirety. The 
most important issue is to focus on the interfaces.” 
[Manger, 2006] 
4.2.5. 
Future 
Many mangers want to talk about the future. A summation of the information is compiled 
as follows 
 
• 
global environment for information management 
• 
virtual product development 
• 
model based development 
• 
a more integration-driven development 
• 
more iterative processes 
• 
a complete tool chain 
• 
earlier verification 
• 
constant verification 
• 
earlier test simulations 
• 
find problems earlier in the process 
• 
better communication. 
 
In addition, discussions about putting more focus on EE development within the R&D are 
desired. According to employees there is a lot of focus on the mechanical development 
 
 
38 
department which many believe is unnecessary. The most important issue to handle in 
the future is the mechatronic aspects and the process for involving EE development 
earlier into the development process. Designers in the EE department require CAD data 
from the mechanical department during the product development process. A requirement 
and information management system is one step in right direction. However, according 
to managers, the new information and requirement management system should have 
been introduced years ago.  
 
Discussions about a clearer vision for EE development are desirable and the objectives 
for the future have to be distributed further. Issues, such as, which path the organisation 
is going to follow, as well, what the objectives for the future are. According to interviews, 
many managers talk about a model based development, but it takes too long for change 
to occur with the organisation.

4.3. The C3PNG project  
The C3PNG project was started at VCC a couple of years ago in the mechanical 
department. The purpose of this project is to introduce the CAD system; Catia V5 and the 
PDM system; TCe. The name C3PNG stands for Computer-Aided Design (CAD); 
Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM); Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE), Product 
Information Management (PIM) and the two last letters stands for the Next Generation. 
It is a global project within Ford and the big focus is on changing CAD system and on 
working out a document structure for the mechanical department. The project is divided 
into two parts: 
 
1. Deployment.  
2. Concept & methods.  
 
According to interviews, the project uses an “implementation pipe”, see Figure 4 (in 
Swedish), for structuring their work during the process.

Work process within the C3PNG project [C3PNG project, 2006] 
 
The C3PNG project has a top-down approach and the initiative of changing systems 
comes from upper management level. During the implementation process, the project 
group has developed work methods to define each role's work method. As one project 
member said:  
 
“All designers have to work using a specific work method and no exceptions will be 
accepted.” 
[Project member, 2006]

The roll-out of the project is project based and all end users are supposed to attend a 
training course connected to the new systems. For a ten-week period, the training 
programme runs courses, surf & learn activities, practical and theoretical practice and at 
the end of the training there are group activities and support at hand. During the courses 
the users work with there own cases and all courses are adjusted to roles and 
responsibilities within the organisation. Some interactive working methods have been 
developed, which are connected to the courses. These methods are adapted to role and 
responsibility and are developed step by step towards finding the designers work 
processes. The work methods are global and are used through the whole concern. 
According to interviews, they think that spending time on training is very important for 
future success.  
 
There have been different kinds of strategies through Ford when introducing the new 
systems, TeamCenter Engineering (TCe) and Catia V5. According to project members, 
they think the methods used during the group activities in the ten-week period, at VCC, 
have been a factor leading to success. Learning the system over such a long time period 
is good and it is important for the designers to become very familiar with the system. At 
VCC, this seems to be effective and productivity after changing the system looks positive. 
Consequently, the methods used during training have been successful and it is 
important, as mentioned in interviews to have one specific work method. As one project 
member from C3PNG said: 
 
“You cannot have the same number of work methods as designers.” 
[Project member, 2006] 
 
As can be concluded from the interviews, it is obvious that the system and work methods 
will lead to a more creative working situation for designers. It is necessary to follow the 
methods set to get rid of inefficient work procedures. The mechanical department has 
greatly needed an information management system, such as TCe, for a long time and 
they also need a requirement management system to handle variations and versions.  
 
Using lessons learned, project members discuss system integration early in the process. 
According to the interviews, it is vital that systems are integrated from the beginning 
because it is difficult to alter later in the process. Sometimes, it can be impossible to 
integrate any modifications.  
 
Issues, such as customisation and standardisation were other areas that were discussed 
during the interviews. There was a pretty pessimistic attitude towards customisation. For 
instance, experience from implementing customisation is the high price. As one project 
member said: 
 
“Customisation is time-consuming, resource-draining as well as being too expensive.” 
[Project member, 2006] 
 
Lessons learned from the project also contain information especially for knowledge about 
the project and the future change. Distribution of information has been successful 
bottom-up within the organisation but the difficult area has been getting information to 
designers and end users. A sign that there is poor communication with end users can be 
shown by the following quote: 
 
“Designers within the organisation see TCe as a necessary evil, and consequently not an 
aid for their daily work situation.” 
[Project member, 2006] 
 
Those interviewed also discuss the increased work load when changing four different 
systems at the same time; changing VPDS to GPDS, PM (document handling system) to 
 
 
41 
TCe, KDP (product data, VCC) to Wers (product data, FMC) and lastly, the CAD system, 
Catia V4 to Catia V5. 
 
According to interviews, the benefits of new IT systems are in particular  
 
• 
a global platform for product data within FMC  
• 
reuse of documents  
• 
a definite work process  
• 
new employees at FMC find the system easier to navigate.

5.  Implementation 
process 
of 
a 
requirement 
management system 
There are a few essential areas to consider when carrying out the implementation 
process of an information management system. The process developed by the author will 
manage the requirement management system (RM system) implementation in EE 
development at VCC. The RM system implementation is the first step towards an 
information management system. The process consists of different phases and each 
phase deals with different tasks and characteristics. The steps are; pre-study, pilot 
runs/refinement of pilot, subprojects, analysis, roll-out, follow-ups and different kinds of 
issues to be decided, see Figure 5. The process builds on knowledge and experiences 
from literature, lessons learned and also interviews with employees within the 
organisation.  
 
 
 
Figure 5. 
Implementation process of a requirement management system  
 
The process starts with a pre-study where some guidelines/tasks are also connected, see 
Table 1. Three important tasks regarding this part of the project are: 
 
1. To choose a strategy.  
2. To define the company's own situation.  
3. To specify requirements.  
 
There are three approaches proposed to consider for the selection of a strategy [Earl, 
1989] & [Brandt et al., 1998] & [Nilsson, 1991]. In the pre-study the change 
management project and supplier will co-operate. For a manger, the reasons for 
introducing a requirement and information management tool is to gain

The next step in the process implies two parallel phases; subprojects and pilot runs. In 
the pilot run phase, the selection of pilots and close co-operation between supplier and 
end user is very important. In the pilot, the system will be adjusted to the users and the 
level of customisation will be defined. Pilots can be run in two different ways; by 
gathering representatives from the whole organisation or by gathering representatives 
from only a small section. The members of the change management project decide the 
best scenario. The strategy determined in this process is a user and effect focus. During 
the pilot run, parallel projects (subprojects) will be in progress, so when the pilot is being 
structured these two parts will contact and provide a lot of feedback to each other. The 
different subprojects will handle different areas. The four subprojects recommended are: 
 
1. Training.  
2. Work methods.  
3. Requirements writing.  
4. Integration/streamlining/PLM thinking. 
 
The author sees these areas as very important tasks to handle during the implementation 
process. During the time when the pilots and subprojects are run, there will be an 
overlapping phase when working with the analysis of the actual situation. This is a part 
for the change management project. When the pilots have been run and all involved 
agree, they reach a point where they decide which system they will continue with and 
how. Decisions concern: 
 
• 
what the next step in the process is  
• 
if the system is ready for roll-out  
• 
the number of people that will be affected in the first roll-out  
• 
if the system needs refinements for other users. 
 
All these decisions will affect any further progress in the process.  
 
There are some specific guidelines/tasks that are essential for roll-out and the training 
programme, see Table 2.

6. Analysis and interpretations 
This chapter focuses on some specific analysis issues and also the implementation 
process of an RM system. Reasons are given for the selection of the guidelines connected 
to each phase of the system and they are discussed in chapter 6.4. 
6.1. Purpose 
In EE development, both managers and designers alike talk about the purpose of 
introducing an RM system. Similarly, there is a lot of literature on the subject and the 
importance of a common purpose. Carlsson [2006] writes about how to define the 
purpose and how it can be divided into three parts:  
 
1. Business effectiveness. 
2. Information effectiveness. 
3. IT effectiveness.  
 
The purpose of introducing an RM system can be further divided. Examples will follow.  
 
Business effectiveness for the introduction of an RM system includes  
 
• 
shorter time to market 
• 
lower costs 
• 
better quality  
• 
lower risks.  
 
This is exactly what mangers today are discussing at VCC.  
 
Information effectiveness includes  
 
• 
easier to find and get information needed, independent of source 
• 
better reuse of common product information between different products 
• 
improved product information sharing between all parties in the lifecycle 
• 
easier to update information.  
 
This is exactly what end users focus on and what comprises their purpose. A vital part to 
handle during the change management project is the different purposes regarding the 
change. This is one method for dealing with the different purposes; divide purpose into 
different levels. Within the overall purpose and vision, time and resources must be spent 
on purpose and effectiveness related to end users.  
6.2. Integration 
The vision of implementing an information management system within EE development 
at VCC is both from a top level manager’s perspective and from a theoretical perspective, 
very closely connected to the advantages offered by integrating the mechanical and 
electrical departments. Theories focus on integrated product development [Olsson, 1976] 
& [Andreasen, 1980] and managers raise the importance of an integrated-driven 
approach for the automotive industry. The automotive industry has a complex product 
development process, so the need for a more structured way to handle documents and 
requirements is vital. According to both designers and managers, EE development 
desperately needs mechanical documents, such as CAD data. According to the C3PNG 
project, the mechanical department desperately needs an RM system with version 
 
 
47 
management. Considering this, there is an all-round need for an integrated development 
process with a first-class support system.  
 
It is interesting to note that the EE development designers interviewed and designers in 
mechanical development never talk about integration. During their interviews, they 
talked about work processes but not integration. This is one reason why the proposed 
subproject should work with increasing knowledge and awareness of integration, 
streamlining and PLM thinking.  
6.3. Information and communication 
From the author’s point of view, information and communication is a very important 
factor contributing to success. Lessons learned from the C3PNG project and materials 
from interviews show that the vital part is communication. Designers talk about the 
importance of an oral information channel during the change process. Today, information 
sometimes stops in the organisation and does not reach the intended level. Managers 
discuss how information is circulated in the organisation but according to designers, 
information is unknown.  Information does not diffuse through the whole organisation. 
Employees at a low hierarchy level talk about poor communication within the 
organisation but they do not know how to handle it. According to Lundberg [2004], it is 
traditionally one of the biggest risks that can come in the way of the successful 
realisation of a change project. According to Ottosson [1999], another vital part when 
analysing communication within the organisation is to ensure that information is fully 
understood by the person who is going to distribute it to the organisation. Every step in 
the information channel needs to be quality-checked to see that the information really 
has been understood. If the visions are not properly understood, there will be an 
unwillingness to accept and use the new work methods.  
6.4. Process 
A Pre-study is very important according to information from both interviews and 
literature [Beskow, 2000]. A vital part of the pre-study is to take sufficient time for 
planning and early work. As one employee said:  
 
“See it as a car project, where all mentioned have equal goals and are working as a large 
team toward successes with the change management project.” 
[Employee at VCC, 2006] 
 
This means that during the whole change project there has to be user focus on 
employees at VCC. From that standpoint, the decision to choose a recommended 
strategy is relative easy. From experience gained from lessons learned in the MBEED and 
eFDVS projects, from an employee perspective and also from recommendations from 
literature, I see the need for an implementation process suited to end users. If you focus 
on end users, it is the specific project who decides whether to work with a bottom-up, 
top-down or inside-out approach [Earl, 1989] & [Brandt et al. 1998] & [Nilsson, 1991]. 
The most important matter is to decide if the specific change project will focus on users 
and effects during the pre-study; the kind of strategy that is suited to the project. A 
conclusion is made within the area of strategy selection; the higher up in the hierarchy, 
the more discussions about standardising systems. Further discussions can be seen 
within Chapter 7.1.2. A very important reminder from Sutinen [2004] is when the PLM 
system itself takes on a central role during the project; it is worth remembering that it is 
only an application meant to facilitate real work. Similarly, Ottersten and Balic [2004] 
imply that it is very usual in projects that the project starts to dominate and focus on the 
effects of change is lost. They think the system will solve the whole problem. Many 
 
 
48 
employees also see this problem and they often see these tendencies in different 
projects. 
 
The pre-study deals with a couple of tasks and all are vital for the success of the project. 
The guidelines connected to each phase of the implementation process are based on an 
adjustment between all three inputs to this thesis; literature, interviews and lessons 
learned. The specific guidelines will be analysed and justified below.   
 
According to managers within the organisation, there are many lessons learned that can 
provide information from other projects from previous years at VCC. It is vital to handle 
this knowledge and experience and really take them into account during the project. 
Following this as a guideline can aid the PLM road map. The goals during the project have 
to be clear, concrete, realistic and shared [Ritzén; Beskow, 2000]. For the MBEED 
project, this was also highlighted as essential when choosing a supplier.  
 
The following guideline is to define the company’s own situation. As recommended by 
Beskow [2000], the project must have at least one pilot run during the change project. 
According to interviews, this is also the only way of involving users during the process. 
The company’s own situation also handles tasks, such as finding PLM maturity, 
alignment, end users' motivation and willingness to change. According to mangers, it 
ought to be satisfactory and beneficial to find out the users' individual motivation and 
attitudes toward the change. This could possibly be done through a questionnaire.  
 
Involving top level management is also a vital part during the change project. Experience 
from the MBEED project at VCC shows this kind of importance [Malvius; Redell; Ritzén, 
2006]. According to interviews, this is also an important task because if employees are at 
too low a level in the organisation they are not heard and seen sufficiently to be able to 
change the process or work method.  
 
The selection of suppliers has to be done during the first phase in the project. This is an 
important choice according to Saaksvuori and Immonen [2003] and lessons learned from 
the MBEED project. Co-operation between company and supplier will last for many years 
and careful selection is most valuable. The supplier is highly influential during the pilot 
runs and it is important when choosing strategy and level of customisation. According to 
Saaksvuori and Immonen [2003], the company must remain ready to react quickly to 
change in the world around it and that involves the supplier to the highest degree. 
According to the MBEED project, a factor leading to success is the choice of supplier and 
the common goal during the process.  
 
According to Balic and Ottersten [2004], they recommend appointing one person or one 
project as responsible for different areas during the project. In a PLM project there ought 
to be responsible projects or key people within the following areas. 
 
Effect focus  
 
The change project has to focus on the effect aspect during the whole process according 
to both theory and interviews [Ottersten; Balic, 2004]. It is easy to forget during the 
mean time so it is good to have a responsible project/person for the task. Within this 
area there are tasks, such as controlling the connection between vision and reality, what 
the new system will compensate and what the common effects are. The person or project 
responsible for the effects during the project will fall into a reminder of never loses the 
outcomes. According to employees, companies have to get better at reducing systems 
from developers' daily work situation: Take this case for example; you have to decide 
which systems will be eliminated when introducing a PLM system. Perhaps just as 
Saaksvuori and Immonen [2003] state: “The value is increased by the new properties 
and possibilities brought by PLM, which allows many old manual processes to be 
converted into electronic processes.” Perhaps, this does not eliminate any systems that 
 
 
49 
the employees want; so an important task for the change project could be to distribute 
information about this.  
 
Promotion  
 
This area consists of information, communication and sales during the project. According 
to lessons learned from C3PNG, eFDVS and literature, this part is difficult and often 
forgotten during the project. It is an essential part for the success of the project and it is 
worth reflecting upon and planning. According to Lundberg [2004], one of the biggest 
risks in the successful realisation of the project has traditionally been the bad 
involvement of the organisation and poor communication arrangement in carrying 
through the change processes. This point has also been argued by employees within the 
organisation and many talk about information as the most important issue during the 
change process. An article in NyTeknik [www.nyteknik.se/art/47303 2004-10-06] states: 
“Establish the information in the whole organisation, everyone has to see the overall 
view, be willing to change and modify their work situation”. According to interviews, the 
information has to be oral, presented early and be well prepared. Employees mention the 
risk of information overflow, so it is necessary for the project/person responsible to be 
careful and clear. Like Saaksvuori and Immonen [2003] says: “Allocate resources” and as 
managers say; “Allocate time, money and resources”. 
 
Pilot runs - A successful feasibility study should contain of at least one pilot project 
according to literature, interviews and the authors point of view. They should include 
verification of the solution, realisation, feed-back from the rest of the organisation and 
realistic schedules for a full-scale implementation. There are some specific tasks that 
have to be taken into account when preparing and accomplishing a pilot project. The 
selection of pilots is essential, according to employees. There are two different ways of 
doing this; either by choosing representatives from the whole organisation or by 
choosing representatives from a smaller area within the organisation [Beskow, 2000] & 
[www.ryman.se, 2006]. This will influence future work for the number of pilots to be 
continued. People involved in the pilot have to be willing to influence, be enthusiastic 
about and truly desire the need for a change in their working process. According to 
interviews, the pilots have to be iterative and use short change and communication links 
with the supplier. A close connection to the requirement specification is necessary during 
the pilot phase as is focusing on the effects. According to employees, collaboration with 
the supplier is essential during pilot runs. Good contact and common goals are vital and 
rapid loops when adjusting the system are important. These rapid loops lead to an 
effective change management process and the end users do not get tired or bored. Many 
employees mention the short time frame within which it is necessary to rapidly and 
efficiently change the work method. During the change project pilot phase it is vital that 
the subproject works in parallel with the pilot.  
 
The implementation process contains subprojects and there will be a close collaboration 
between the two phases; subprojects and pilot run. If things happen unexpectedly during 
the process, the RM project will be there to manage them. Literature on this subject 
recommends having subprojects in parallel to the ongoing pilot. An important task for the 
project is the overall view and the further connection between the pieces of puzzle in its 
vision towards PLM. According to literature about integrated product development and 
arguments from interviews, there ought to be pilots or workshops when running a pilot 
for a requirement system for the mechanical department. There may be some pilot 
refinements (pilot set 1, pilot set 2), see Figure 5. This means that other areas, users or 
departments can be examined for refinement.  After running another set of pilots where 
the system can be refined, two decisions can be made; run three pilots or an additional 
roll-out. Lessons learned from the MBEED project show that new areas within EE 
development using new information or functionality have to have a new pilot process, 
which could benefit from being shorter.  
 
 
 
50 
Subprojects - These are run in parallel to the pilot phase. There ought to be several 
specific subprojects during the project [Saaksvuori; Immonen, 2003]. Subprojects, as 
recommended from material analysed, are for 
 
• 
training 
• 
requirement writing  
• 
work methods 
• 
increasing the knowledge of integration/streamlining/PLM thinking.  
 
A comprehensive progress plan ought to be carried out as literature states [Saaksvuori; 
Immonen, 2003], where a schedule is drawn up for all separate projects and their 
contents. These four projects will be mentioned and analysed below. 
 
Training  
 
According to literature [Saaksvuori; Immonen, 2003] and lessons learned from the 
C3PNG project, training is vital. All potential users should have some education and 
deployment in the project has to be well prepared and discussed. According to literature 
[Ibid], for the majority of cases, the need for training is badly underestimated. Training 
should support individual learning and commitment to work. According to employees, the 
training programme should be focused on practical work with several examples taken 
from ongoing business in the company. A project that deals with training is necessary 
according to C3PNG and as came out of that project, courses ought to be suited to each 
role/responsibility and also specific work methods. Further information on this can be 
viewed in the chapter on work methods. The section covering roll-out will illustrate just 
what should be included in training.  
 
Requirement writing  
 
In association with the training programme, a course in requirements writing should be 
run. According to designers, requirements today are often very badly written and they 
should be drafted in a more appropriate and clear manner. At present, there is confusion 
about  
 
• 
what level the requirement ought to be 
• 
options to verify 
• 
unclear information connected to the requirements 
• 
why and from where the requirement comes  
• 
which requirements are correct and updated.  
 
During a course which focuses on requirement writing, there should be elements focusing 
on the iterative processes regarding requirement management.  
 
Work methods (interactive models)  
 
If the information chain and the work process for each role in the organisation are found, 
it should be possible to establish a subproject that works out methods for these 
processes. This type of process will manage the link between work processes and tools. A 
great need of working methods have been identified during the interviewees and finding 
a defined work process for each role should be a success according to the author’s point 
of view. An interactive model could be used, just as the C3PNG project implemented for 
their end users, see Figure 6. This is one way of defining that process. For instance, that 
will make it easier for new employees in EE development at VCC. According to interviews, 
there are great needs for better documentation and to understand other designers' work 
methods. Many designers want to understand how other designers carry out their work in 
an efficient way and hopefully documented work processes will help to achieve that. A 
 
 
51 
systematic work method will make it much easier for users to do their job in an efficient 
and structured way.  
 
 
Figure 6.  
Work methods developed in the C3PNG project 
 
Literature [Carlsson, 2006] & [Saaksvuori; Immonen, 2003] discusses the same issue 
(undefined working processes) as the employees at VCC; often at companies there is a 
lack of guidance and documentation for employees, a lack of instructions on how to use 
IT systems and there are alternative ways of performing tasks. According to interviews 
those are the precise problems within EE development at VCC. Employees say that 
everyone works differently and we need instructions on how the system ought to be 
used.  
 
Integration/streamlining/PLM thinking  
 
From the author's viewpoint, which is based on knowledge from theory about integrated 
product 
development, 
having 
a 
group 
who 
focuses 
on 
these 
areas 
(Integration/streamlining/PLM thinking) is essential. This theory states that the benefits 
of a new system or process can only come true on a planned scale if people and 
organisations realise the significance of the project and change their way of thinking and 
operating in accordance with the new models.  Mangers within the organisation at EE 
development view the needs for increasing knowledge about integration, lean and PLM 
gains. From lessons learned from the C3PNG project, designers see the PLM system as a 
hindrance and not as an aid for reusing and integrating information. This can be 
perceived as a sign of poor knowledge and information about the purpose and benefits of 
the system. To increase knowledge in this area, information, workshops or courses which 
focus on the subjects have to be provided. Perhaps this information can be connected to 
the training phase during the implementation process of an RM tool. Employees in EE 
development indicate the dominating mechanical focus within VCC. Integration is 
necessary for the future according to literature about integrated product development 
and the EE development has to be involved earlier in the product development process 
(GPDS). That means more of an integration-driven product development process, just as 
one manger mentioned. Lean thinking is another important issue. Some people know a 
lot about it and some do not. As one employee mentioned, the lean thinking mindset has 
to be adopted in the process to minimise waste.  
 
Analysis - This means involving discussions about additional functionality or other areas 
within the organisation. Analysis of discussions between project members, suppliers and 
willing end users is carried out.  
 
Decisions - These have to be made. Some specific issues (What the next step in the 
process is/If the system is ready for roll-out/The number of people that will be affected in 
the first roll-out/If the system needs refinements for other users) were created and the 
 
 
52 
author recommends discussing those areas for discussion with in the change 
management project.  
 
Roll-out - The next step in the process is roll-out. From an employee perspective, it is 
important that a specific course can be adapted to individuals. This adjustment is 
important in many aspects; the C3PNG project indicates that their adjustment to 
individuals when using work methods, suitable courses and the longer existence of 
groupings contributed to their good results in terms of effectiveness. According to 
interviews, learning the system' order is one of the important matters. Firstly, all the 
users want the material and system. Secondly, users want to test the system by 
themselves as a first step before taking a course connected to the system. Thirdly, an 
important issue during the training period is to work with real work from their ongoing 
cases. It was pointed out during the interviews that mangers want to sit next to end 
users during training. Manager’s view learning the system together with users is a very 
positive thing. The training programme is developed from an end user approach and 
tasks connected to the training programme are identified. The roll-out also focuses on 
the management role during implementation. According to interviews, there are many 
aspects to this part. The specific role that managers should have, from the developers' 
viewpoint, is mentioned in chapter 4.1.4. A final matter within roll-out is how to inform 
designers and managers about the training programme and courses. Success can be 
reached depending on how the change project provides information about it. By 
promoting the course on how to handle requirements in a more efficient way instead of 
calling and ordering designers to participate in courses you should gain a more positive 
and willing attitude from designers concerned to learn the new system. 
 
Follow-up/support - It will be much easier if the project group, already at the 
beginning of the process, considers how to carry out the follow-up. According to theory 
[Horkeby; Areblad, 1998], special attention must be paid to ensure that old habits are 
not retained by new users. It is all to the better if the old system can simply be switched 
off. Parallel approaches cause confusion and slow down the process of getting used to the 
new system. A vital part is to introduce follow-up meetings. These meetings should be at 
every level in the organisation. In the C3PNG project there were no other work methods 
than the methods permitted by the project group responsible. Employees also pointed 
out that a good way of learning was from each other; this can be done through a 
workshop with users.  
 
Additional PLM functionality - This process has been developed to implement an RM 
tool within EE development at VCC. I believe that the process can perhaps be used when 
adding additional functionality towards a more extensive PLM system. At VCC, the first 
step towards PLM is the requirement management system and according to interviews, 
there are great needs for an integrated information system, so perhaps that is the next 
step.

7.  Discussion 
The following section will consist of a discussion about some specific criteria that the 
author perceives to be vital for succeeding with both an RM system implementation and 
with additional functionality towards a PLM system. Perhaps a requirement management 
change ought to have been done earlier at VCC but regardless, it is still very important 
that such a system is successful. There is a long way to go to reach the overall vision 
with PLM but taking it gradually (starting with RM) and focusing on the effects is to be 
recommended [Ottersten; Balic, 2004]. Developers truly need such systems.   
7.1. Purpose  
Analyses done will bring to light many different kinds of purposes to support the 
introduction of an information management system. Carlsson [2006] divided purpose into 
three parts; business effectiveness, information effectiveness and IT effectiveness. Some 
discussions concerning purpose when introducing a new IT system follows. The chapter 
cover the balance between visions, the present work situation and tools. Furthermore, 
the end user's purpose is a large part of the overall purpose and the integration aspect of 
the systems is essential.  
7.1.1. 
Balance between visions, present work situation and 
tools 
An essential part during a change management project is the balance between the three 
areas; visions, present work situation and tools. From my point of view, I see the 
importance of support, as shown in Figure 7, between the present work situation and the 
tool. If these two areas are really connected and examined, reaching the vision will be 
much easier. In the case of an RM system for EE development, the overall goal ought to 
be a satisfied end user, see Figure 8. An end user wants a more efficient way of working 
when dealing with information and requirement management. The end user wants to 
reuse material, get better control and structure, be able to work at a faster speed and 
gain higher quality with no duplicated work. I see this pyramid as a good visual aid to 
explain my idea to reach the vision. If present work situation and tools are well prepared 
and thoroughly examined, the way to achieve the vision desired is within reach. 
According to employees, it is very important to get a balance between vision and reality 
and if the change project focuses on the two supporting sections, reality will always be a 
part of the change project. The vision of a happy end user is vital to be able to succeed 
with the change management project.

There are different purposes within a change management project, such as PLM projects. 
One purpose within EE development when changing the work method for designers looks 
like the object illustrated in Figure 8, which shows a happy end user. This purpose is a 
vital part of the overall vision of the change.  
 
The overall vision within a PLM system is, e.g., higher efficiency, lower costs and better 
quality. One overall vision can also be the integration aspect, see Figure 9. From my 
point of view, it is really important that the overall vision and the vision connected to the 
end users goes hand-in-hand. In the figure bellow the triangle is a part of the overall 
purpose. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 8. 
Close connection between overall purpose and end user purpose  
 
When we discuss the overall vision for the whole R&D unit we can begin to consider 
system integration, choice of supplier and interfaces. If the vision for the R&D 
department is integration-driven development, that will influence the PLM project during 
the whole process from the start when introducing an RM system. The system integration 
of a PLM system can be done in many different ways but it is worth considering early in 
the PLM project because of decisions, such as supplier and interfaces. Within VCC today 
there are two different projects in the R&D department that work in the same area but 
are very isolated from each other; C3PNG and VSEM. The two projects are aiming for a 
vertical integration in specific departments. As an overall vision, I see system integration 
within the R&D department. This is a competitive solution for VCC in the future, see 
Figure 12. Systems could be linked to a PLM system, such as  
 
• 
CAD-tools 
• 
FEM-tools 
• 
simulation tools  
• 
software development tools.

55 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 9. 
PLM vision of integration  
 
The vision is vital, as is the choice of supplier and interface capability. As one MBEED 
project member said: 
 
“It is essential to find a supplier with the same vision and goal setting as the company 
because they will co-operate for many years.” 
[Project member, 2006] 
 
The vision of a future PLM system from a designer’s perspective is to get a complete tool 
chain. One that makes demands on a PLM system that integrates horizontally. A first step 
in that process ought to be a carry-over of the RM system, see Figure 10. That could be 
one alternative way to start horizontal integration in the real world. Employees both 
within the EE and mechanical development are in great need of such system. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 10. 
Carry-over between the systems 
 
One way to carry this out is to start with requirement management system integration. 
The mechanical department is in great needs of a requirement system, version handling 
with functional requirements which are also the basis for the integration. EE development 
also needs CAD documents from mechanical development. During the first pilot phase 
there should be a workshop to connect EE development with mechanical development. 
The development process aims for an operational integration development, according to 
interviews, and the need for the new GPDS to run in parallel with the new systems is 
essential. If GPDS' vision is to integrate disciplines, the systems have to be suited for 
that way of thinking. To transform this to PLM thinking and integration, we need to coach 
people to thinking in a PLM and integration way. Today, the company structure is not 
suitable for this mindset and there we have a long way to go to adapt it to the whole 
organisation. According to literature [Olsson, 1976] & [Andreasen, 1980], it is important

56 
to start guiding the departments to a more efficient way of working. At present at VCC, 
there is a lack of conformity within the R&D department. This has been ascertained from 
interviews: where two disciplines are active and a strong mechanical focus within the 
organisation is very apparent.  
 
 “Coming together is a beginning – Keeping together is progress – Working together is a 
success.”  
[Henry Ford] 
 
"Break down barriers between departments; abolish competition and build a win-win 
system of cooperation."  
[Mary Poppendieck] 
7.1.2. 
Notice the different purposes 
On reflection, there are differences in diverse purposes. The designers’ purpose focuses 
on their daily work situation. This is in contrast to the purpose expressed from a 
manager’s perspective. Management indicates purpose on a much more general level. 
Purpose, as expressed from a managerial perspective is to attain better quality, become 
more efficient and improve integration.  
 
I see the importance of distributing purpose and information at the right level. If the 
needs of a requirement management tool are apparent at the second level (purpose 2, 
see Figure 11) vision and information ought to be suited just for them. If purpose 2 is 
fulfilled, I believe that purpose 1 will indeed become true. But a very important matter is 
that both purposes 1 and 2 have to be understood. If purpose 2 is the general purpose 
for the whole project it is vital that end users will be involved during the process. In this 
case, when implementing an RM/PLM system in EE development, the system is really 
created for the designers and vision and information should be suited to them.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 11. 
Purposes 
7.2. Standardisation or customisation 
It is vital to discuss whether to customise or not to customise. According to project 
members from C3PNG and managers in EE development, such discussions are too 
expensive, time-consuming and resource-draining. However, subjectively speaking, it is 
worth considering, because the selected system will be in use for a long time and the 
world can change significantly in a three-year period. According to literature [Saaksvuori; 
Immonen, 2003] extensive customisation of existing software can make new version 
upgrades very laborious. This risk is particularly evident in large scale customisation, for 
 
 
57 
instance, when modifying data models. But if the system is adjusted to the end users 
work methods, it will be easier to learn and adapt the new system solution. As interviews 
indicate, it is very important to have a well-prepared information model when introducing 
an RM/PLM tool. The information model has to be well adapted to the real work situation 
at the company; vision and reality have to be properly linked. If the project has this 
information model, it will be quite acceptable to have 80% standardised system and 20% 
customised. I see this as an important task to discuss with the parties concerned, such 
as supplier and end users. 20% customisation can include simple things but the system 
has to be adjusted. A project member from C3PNG called it tailoring when no additional 
programming was involved. Customisation can lead to expensive upgrades but it can 
make work easier for end users.  
7.3. Implementation suited to end users  
Subjectively speaking, strategy is; focusing on the end users and its effects. If that 
permeates the whole implementation process of a new information management system 
(PLM system) I believe it is excellent. Focusing on end users its effects are not connected 
to expensive, time-consuming and so on according to my point of view. In other words, 
these two parts ought to be the focus during the whole project. The needs of an RM 
system began at that specific level and purpose ought to be addressed for designers. An 
RM tool is specifically for the designers and that should imply that the process is suited to 
them. 
 
There ought to be a roll-out adjusted to each role and responsibility. According to Hallin, 
Zimmerman and Malmqvist [2004], it is very important to identify to what degree users 
are receptive to the introduction of a new tool based on a top management decision. It is 
very important to identify the designers' motivation and willingness to change [Ibid], 
when introducing a PLM system. According to C3PNG, there was a mental changeover 
from the two work methods that had to be handled in an orderly way. Support for 
different kinds of people was noted as being important too. A specific workshop for 
non-motivated users is perhaps one way of dealing with this. It is very important in this 
kind of situation to adjust courses and information as users only want to hear information 
connected to their individual work situation. Getting an overview of the situation and 
architecture is also important according to interviews. As stated in literature; when 
planning for a project, there is no cost when taking into account employees' ability to 
adapt to the new idea. The fact is that it is always easier to stay in a familiar 
environment than starting something new that you do not know so much about. 
According to Rogers [1995], the more complex an innovation seems, the more time it will 
take for an individual to adapt to the new idea. He also points out that the faster the 
results of an innovation can be seen, the faster the individual will adapt to it. It is 
important that the innovation will be experienced as something that is much more 
preferable than the old ways [Rogers, 1995]. Extra resources must be made available to 
take care of the more psychological aspects, employees tend to resist change.  
 
 
 
58 
 
8. Conclusions and recommendations 
It is a complex task to change a designer's way of working when handling information 
and requirements. But there are great needs for the transition from textual and manual 
work to a computerised environment. Co-operation between the brands within FMC 
requires strategic projects to be better synchronised, as they involve more people from 
different backgrounds and nationalities to communicate requirements and other product 
information within the organisation to one another. The development of more efficient IT 
systems supporting information and requirement management is essential for the future 
for VCC and Ford. Consequently, this indicates the importance of succeeding with an 
introduction of an information management system within the organisation. The first step 
at VCC is the requirement management system that will be introduced where it is 
important to involve and absorb the system end users.  
 
There are several important issues to handle during the change project. According to the 
three information channels and the author’s conclusions, the end user and effect focus 
are vital during the whole change process. Lessons learned from earlier projects within 
the organisation show the significance of involving end users early in the process. 
Similarly, during the project there is a great need for information to involve the parties 
concerned. Information and communication are the most critical points when considering 
an IT system introduction.  
 
An introduction suited to the needs of the individual is also important for motivating new 
users. Suitable system training can be done through many different ways; courses 
adjusted to roles and responsibilities and pilot projects, etc. It is important to define 
areas of responsibility within the change management project, just as it is for effects and 
information. Subprojects that are recommended  
 
• 
training adjusted to individuals 
• 
work methods 
• 
courses in requirement writing  
• 
a group working with increasing the awareness and knowledge of PLM and 
streamlining 
• 
integration mindset.   
 
An integration mindset is vital early in the change process, within the common purpose 
of the project. The integration aspects influence the selection of supplier and the 
standardisation or customisation level of the system. An information management 
system can be a good reason to gain better integration between departments within VCC.  
 
The following recommendations information management system implementations have 
been identified in this research: 
 
• 
inform and involve end users 
• 
training adjusted to individuals 
• 
end user and effect focus during the whole change project 
• 
pilots with close co-operation between supplier and end user 
• 
interactive work methods 
• 
the change must have strong support among all concerned.
