Sammanfattning 
Mängden idéer hos innovativa företag brukar vanligen överskrida de tillgängliga resurserna. Detta gäller 
även idéer för att utveckla nya produkter. Eftersom företagen inte kan välja att utveckla alla idéer så 
måste de kunna välja emellan dessa. Detta innebär att kunna ta beslut gällande start och stop av ett 
projekt samt att kunna prioritera mellan pågående och framtida projekt.    
Projektportföljshantering (PPM) är en organisatorisk process med syfte att systematiskt organisera och 
driva verksamhet som syftar till att utvärdera, välja och prioritera idéer och projekt för att utveckla nya 
produkter. PPM inkluderar fyra viktiga mål som skall uppfyllas; maximera värdet av portföljen, att 
uppnå en balanserad portfölj, uppnå en strategisk riktning och driva rätt antal projekt.  
Syftet med examensarbetet var att utveckla en mer visuell och formell PPM process för tidiga skeden i 
produktutvecklingen, detta på en specifik avdelning på St Jude Medical AB, Sverige.  
Examensarbetet har utförts genom att följa en metodik vid namn Process Modules. Metodiken är ett 
förhållningssätt för att utveckla en PPM process som passar ett specifikt företag. Metoden är inte en 
fastställd arbetsordning för beslutsfattande, utan en systematisk metod för att utveckla en.  
Examensarbetet har utförts i nära samarbete med en definierad arbetsgrupp bestående av sex 
beslutsfattare på St Jude Medical AB, Sverige. I ett tidigt stadie lyckades författarna kartlägga den 
nuvarande beslutsprocessen hos den specifika avdelning. Processen visade sig vara rätt så informell och 
bestod inte av nårgra formella kriterier. Under en workshop, identifierades och definierades en mängd 
formella beslutskriterier, tillsammans med arbetsgruppen. Slutligen har den nya PPM processen 
definierats och visualiserats av författarna.  
Ett antal övergripande och viktiga reflektioner togs av författarna efter att ha utfört detta examensarbete. 
Den viktigaste reflektionen är det faktumet att varje PPM process är och bör vara företagsspecifik. Då 
en PPM process utvecklas bör de faktiskt beslutsfattarna vara involverade i denna utveckling. Detta för 
att öka förståelsen för den slutgiltiva processen.

Abstract 
The number of ideas at innovative companies usually exceeds the amount of available human or 
material recourses, this include ideas for development of new products. Since they are not able to do 
everything they want to do they have to choose between ideas to develop new products. This includes 
the decision on when to start, stop or kill a project as well as the thought process of prioritizing between 
ongoing and potential projects. 
Project Portfolio Management (PPM) is an organizational process, with the purpose of systematically 
organizing and running the activities that aim to evaluate, select and prioritize ideas and projects for 
developing new products. PPM include four major goals to be fulfilled; Maximizing Value of the 
Portfolio, Achieving a Balanced Portfolio, Achieving a Strategic Alignment and Running the Right 
Number of Projects.  
The purpose of the thesis was to develop a more visual and formal PPM process for the early stages in 
product development in one department at St Jude Medical AB, Sweden.  
The thesis was conducted by following a methodology known as Process Modules. The methodology is 
an approach for developing a PPM process that fits a specific company. The methodology is not a 
defined work procedure for decision making but rather a systematic method for developing one.  
The thesis was conducted by working closely with a defined Work Group consisting of six decision 
makers at St Jude Medical AB, Sweden. Initially, the authors managed to map the current PPM process 
at the department in focus which showed to be rather informal and not using formal criteria. Together 
with the Work Group, the process was formalized and visualized. During a workshop, a set of selection 
criteria were identified and defined, and so was a set of balance criteria. Finally, the new PPM process 
was defined and visualized by the authors.  
A number of overall important reflections were concluded by the authors after conducting this master 
thesis. The main reflection is the fact that every PPM process is, and needs to be, company specific. 
Further on, when developing a PPM process it is of great importance to involve management and 
involved staff in the actual procedure, in order to increase the understanding of the final process.

1. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE 
This chapter aims at giving the reader a brief introduction to this master thesis. 
Project Portfolio Management as a subject will be presented in section 1.2 followed 
by a description of the actual problem in section 1.3. The purpose of the thesis (1.4) 
and its delimitations (1.5) will also be presented. Finally, the chapter ends with an 
outline section (1.6) which gives the reader an understanding of the structure of this 
report.  
1.1. Introduction 
The number of ideas at innovative companies usually exceeds the amount of available 
recourses. Since companies are not able to initiate all projects, decisions are needed to 
be taken in order to know which project to start. This decision also includes whether 
or not to stop/kill projects and how to prioritize between ongoing and potential 
projects.  Developing new products is often a long process lasting for several months 
or years. The ideas are also often vaguely described. The difficulty is how to select 
winners and successful products for the future. This decision has to be taken today. 
Success in new product development will make the corporation an innovative leader 
while a failure will make the corporation disappear or be acquired by the winners 
(Cooper, Edgett & Kleinschmidt, 1998). 
There are a number of difficulties that re-occur concerning the quality and selection of 
product development in R&D projects and these difficulties are perfect reasons to 
implement and adapt a Product Portfolio Management process. Some of the 
difficulties experienced include the lack of formal criteria when evaluating ideas, the 
weak link between strategy and project selection, the reluctance to kill projects and 
that many organizations suffer from too many ongoing projects in relation to 
resources.  
1.2. Project Portfolio Management  
To become a winner there is one question that needs an answer: How should 
corporations most effectively invest their R&D and new product resources? Portfolio 
management concern: resource allocation to achieve corporate new product 
objectives. The managers who want to optimize their R&D investment need to make 
sure to define the right new product strategy, select the winning new product projects, 
and achieve the ideal balance of projects to win in the long run (Cooper et al, 1998). 
Project portfolio management (PPM) is the organizational process that aims to 
systematically organizing and running the activities that aim to evaluate, select and 
prioritize ideas and projects for developing new products. This is intended for aligning 
development investments with company’s strategic goals, reducing the risk caused by 
uncertainty, accepting and making trade-offs between alternatives, and monitoring 
2 
 
portfolio performance. An efficient PPM would have a positive impact in 
organizations by improving communication, allowing efficient resource allocation and 
terminating projects (Gutiérrez et al, 2008).  
A good way of summarizing the above is by presenting the four goals of project 
portfolio management (Cooper, Edgett & Kleinschmidt, 1998) which will be further 
explained in Chapter 4.  
 Maximization of value 
 Balance 
 Strategic direction  
 Right number of projects 
1.3. Problem Discussion 
The master thesis has been conducted at St Jude Medical AB, Sweden (SJM) at 
Veddesta, a company that develops medical technology and services with the aim of 
increasing control for those who treat cardiac, neurological and chronic pain 
worldwide.  
St Jude Medical has its head quarter based  in St Paul, Minnesota, US and consists of 
several divisions and has approximately 14000 employees worldwide. The largest 
division is the Cardiac Rhythm Management division (CRMD) and the primary 
business of this division is R&D and manufacturing of systems for pacemaker, 
implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization (CRT) 
therapy. St Jude Medical AB, Sweden is part of the CRMD division and the site has 
about 700 employees and is based in Veddesta, northwest of Stockholm. 
Since the difficulties mentioned above are common across many organizations these 
are also at some extent experienced by SJM. Additionally, the department in focus for 
the thesis needed to develop a more visual and formal PPM process for its early stage 
in the product development. The thesis aims at, together with the decision makers at 
the companies, refine and develop the current PPM process. The importance of PPM, 
and its link to the overall business strategy, is vital when striving at keeping or 
becoming the market leader since PPM provides a balanced and a structured portfolio.  
1.4. Purpose of Thesis 
The purpose of the thesis was to develop a formal Project Portfolio Management 
process with the help of a methodology known as Process Modules (PM). The result 
will not only be presented in a technical report but will also to some extent be 
visualized to ease the usage, the communication and implementation at the company.

1.4.1. Goal of Master Thesis 
The major goal of the master thesis is the following; 
With the help of Process Modules, manage to map, analyze and refine 
the current decision making process at the department in focus at St. 
Jude Medical AB, Sweden, together with the company staff. 
Emphasizing on new tools to be presented by the Master Thesis team 
and practised and adapted to the current decision environment and its 
demands.  
1.5. Delimitations 
Delimitations have been established in order to suit the scope of the thesis and are the 
following:  
 The thesis will focus on the earlier stages of the product development process, 
at a specific department at SJM, known as Leads, see Figure 1. The focus will 
stretch from idea generation to the Conceptualization Process (COP).  
 
Figure 1 - The thesis will focus on early stages of product development 
 The thesis work will not take the resource allocation into consideration. The 
meetings, staff and decision making processes regarding recourse allocation 
will not be mapped or analyzed. The final result will not include any 
suggestions regarding the resource allocation when it comes to the Project 
Portfolio Management Process. 
1.5.1. Constrains 
 A great deal of the results has been developed together with staff at SJM by 
holding a number of meetings and workshops. The time constrain have limited 
Idea Generation
Conceptualization
Technology 
Development
Productification

the number of conducted meetings and workshops, hence it limits the staff 
input and leave more development to the master thesis team. This could in turn 
decrease the company’s influence of the results.  
1.6. Outline 
Figure 2 below presents the outline of the master thesis. Following this chapter the 
methodology used during the master thesis is presented in chapter 2. The method 
conducted at SJM as well as sources of information outside the company is presented. 
This gives the reader the necessary information to fully comprehend the methodology. 
To give the reader a comprehensive understanding of the environment and context at 
SJM, chapter 3 presents the background of the company and the current environment. 
This includes the product development process, the organization, and the current idea 
management situation.   
 
Figure 2 - The outline of the master thesis 
Additionally, the theoretical chapter aims at giving the reader a thorough 
understanding of Project Portfolio Management. Chapter 4 includes motivation and 
background, definition, the different tools and methods and how these are 
implemented, and some recommendations from literature when implementing a PPM 
process.  
Following chapters are results and analyses of the performed research. Chapter 5 
presents the results from two different learning stages, the results from the interview 
analysis and the results from the discussion meeting and the conducted workshop. 
Chapter 6 presents the final PPM process developed by the authors from the 
learning’s and findings presented in the earlier chapters.

with additional process support methods to be used in the developed PPM process.  
Chapter 8 ends the thesis with recommendations that are given by the authors that 
should be taken into consideration in order to achieve a successful implementation of 
the PPM process.

2. METHODOLOGY  
The aim of this chapter is to give the reader a comprehensive understanding of the 
methodology used during the master thesis research. The first section (2.1) explains 
the feasibility and the literature study. The second section (2.2) describes the 
practical process deployed at the specific department at SJM and how primary and 
secondary data was collected. This gives the reader the necessary information to fully 
comprehend the methodology. The final section (2.3) discusses the criticisms of the 
sources when collecting data.  
2.1. Feasibility & Literature Study 
An extensive study has been conducted to achieve comprehension of the current 
decision making process at the department in focus at SJM.  
Literature and research studies have been revised regarding Project Portfolio 
Management in general, decision-making tools and implementation of these. 
2.2. Customized PM Process 
Since PPM is highly complex process and involves many different areas it is difficult 
to design a general process that would suit every company. The PM methodology 
(Guitiérrez, 2009) is an approach for developing a PPM process that fits a specific 
company. In other words, the methodology is not a defined work procedure for 
decision making but rather a systematic method for developing one. The PM approach 
has been adapted by the authors during this thesis in order to achieve the stated goals.  
Further on, the PM methodology has been reconfigured by the authors to suit the 
timeframe of the master thesis, the department in focus and their working procedure 
as well as other constrains. It is the customized process that will be presented in this 
chapter.  
The methodology used has been divided into different phases, see Figure 3. By 
working through the different phases during the research, the authors were able to 
map and together with the Work Group refine the current decision making process 
and its included parts.

Figure 3 – The different modules of the methodology 
2.2.1. Preparation 
In order to succeed with the development and introduction of a new work procedure it 
is important to obtain the necessary support of company management, to assure that 
necessary resources and the required priority are given to the project work.  
Together with the supervisors, the authors defined the Work Group and the Focus 
Group, two highly necessary groups for the research. 
The Work Group 
It was together with the Work Group that the authors designed the PPM process 
including its key factors, such as decision criteria and balance criteria. It was 
important for the research that the Work Group consisted of cross-functional members 
and included people involved in the decision-making and also the ones affected by 
them.  
The Work Group consisted of five members including the two supervisors for the 
master thesis. Table 1 gives an overview of the participants and their role in the 
organization.

The Focus Group 
The Focus Group was a larger group who played a significant role during the data 
collection and the interview phase. They included all the members from the Work 
Group with cross-functional competence. Further on, the group consisted of members 
from different hierarchical levels. This was to get a broad overview of the current 
situation. While management positions give projects high status and priority, low 
hierarchies assure that things are done. The different hierarchical levels also helped 
the team to understand how the flow of information looks between different 
hierarchical levels.  
Before the data collection started, the authors informed the involved participants, the 
Focus Group, that they would take part in interviews. Additionally, the purpose of the 
thesis was described and also the reason for conducting it.  
Weekly Meetings 
In order to ensure progress of the research and verify ongoing results the authors 
continually conducted meetings with the supervisors in a weekly basis. During these 
meetings, topics such as results and upcoming work were handled.   
Timeframe 
At an early stage of the thesis, the authors constructed a Gantt schedule; see 
Appendix 1, in order to get an overview of the research. Important stages and 
deliverables were identified in the schedule but there was also room left for flexibility 
and changes. The schedule was introduced to the SJM supervisors and adapted to the 
quarterly planning of the SJM Leads department.     
2.2.2. Data Collection 
The purpose of the data collection module was for the authors to collect as much data 
as possible regarding the current PPM process at department in focus at SJM. Since 
the concept of PPM may be new for many people, information was found by further 
investigating the more general processes that usually surrounds PPM, such as idea 
handling, evaluation and selection of ideas and projects and strategies for product 
development. The following chapter describes how this data collection was 
conducted.  
Interviews 
The interview respondents were members from the previously defined Focus Group. 
They were ten people who in some way are involved and affected by decisions that 
are taken regarding evaluation and selection of ideas and projects. The respondents 
included, amongst others, project managers, project members, specialist, process 
developers etc. 
9 
 
An already existing interview guide from the PM research was further developed and 
used in this phase which can be found in Appendix 2. The interview session focused 
on five main aspects:  
 Description of how PPM is currently run 
 Requirements that different actors and groups state on a PPM process 
 Problems in the current work procedure 
 Opportunities for improvement 
 How information is communicated throughout the organization 
Internal Documents 
Another important part of the data collection phase was the collecting of internal 
documents. Documents regarding decisions for evaluation and selecting ideas and 
projects were taken into consideration. The types of documents collected included 
amongst others process maps, previously defined criteria and written procedures and 
manuals describing how ideas should be managed.  
2.2.3. Data Analysis 
The goal of the conducted interviews was to achieve a description about how 
decisions were taken in the current situation, what the staff thought about the situation 
and the decisions, and to identify problems and opportunities for improvement. By 
following the PM methodology the interviews were at a later stage analyzed. When 
analyzing the data both formal decision-making and informal decision-making was 
taken into consideration. Informal decision-making data was found by carefully 
analyzing the data in order to identify situations where people achieved a common 
agreement and reached consensus that something needs to be done. The analyzing 
stage of the research came to be an iterative procedure where the results were 
continually verified in the weekly meetings. The result of the analysis was essentially 
a process map describing how an idea evolves to a project and a list of improvement 
areas and solutions.  
2.2.4. Discussion Meeting 
Since the previously described analysis was based upon interpretation of data a 
discussion was later on conducted with the Work Group in order to validate the 
results. The authors presented the mapped process, the identified problem areas and a 
deeper look at the PPM-theory connected to the SJM situation. The purpose of the 
discussion was for the Work Group to verify the findings and to decide what the 
authors would focus on in the further development of the PPM-process.  
2.2.5. Workshop 
An important part of the research was a whole-day workshop that was conducted 
together with the Work Group and led by the authors. The workshop was divided into 
10 
 
two parts, one regarding selection criteria and the other one regarding balance criteria. 
The following chapter describes how this workshop was carried out.  
The authors were the moderators of the workshop, using previously designed PM 
instructions as a guide. 
Selection Criteria 
The purpose of the Selection Criteria part of the workshop was to identify and define 
criteria for selecting and prioritizing projects. For a detailed description of the 
workshop and its including steps, see Appendix 3. 
The workshop was conducted together with the Work Group and the idea was that the 
participating group would be the ones identifying and defining criteria, whilst the 
authors only had roles as moderators. The authors gave input and suggestions to the 
group when needed.  
Balance Criteria  
The purpose of the Balance Criteria part of the workshop was to identify and define 
criteria for balancing a portfolio of projects. For a detailed description of the 
workshop, see Appendix 4. This workshop was also conducted with the workgroup. 
The task was to construct diagrams and define its axles in order to visualize ongoing 
projects in different ways.  
2.2.6. Development 
The last module of the methodology used was the Development phase. During this 
stage the authors analyzed all collected results from the interviews, the discussion and 
the workshop in order to compose the final PPM process and including 
recommendations for successful implementation.    
2.3. Criticism of the Sources 
In any form of research, it is important to be critical to the sources used, in order for 
the study to become as honest as possible. The authors have in the thesis both been 
using primary and secondary data. Primary data include the conducted interviews, the 
discussion meeting and the workshop, whilst the secondary data include the literature 
study. The primary data should be seen as reliable but it is important to consider that 
all respondents are employees of SJM and may not want to be too critical. 
The secondary data is also seen as reliable since the authors of the literature are well 
known researchers that have dedicated years in the field of Project Portfolio 
Management. On the other hand, this does not necessarily mean that the authors of the 
literature have not been subjective in their theories and conclusions, and that this 
subjectivity may reflect itself in this thesis.

3. THE CONTEXT: THE CURRENT 
ENVIRONMENT 
The following sections briefly describe the background of St. Jude Medical AB, 
Sweden, and the current environment. The product development process and its 
different phases will be presented in order to give the reader a better organizational 
understanding. Important meeting forums that take place at the organization will be 
described as well as how ideas are managed and processed at SJM. Information 
comprising the chapter was gathered from SJM’s corporate documentation and 
interviews.  
3.1. The Company: St. Jude Medical AB, Sweden 
St Jude Medical has its head quarter based in St Paul, Minnesota, US and consists of 
several divisions and has approximately 14000 employees worldwide. The largest 
division is the Cardiac Rhythm Management division (CRMD) and the primary 
business of this division is R&D and manufacturing of systems for pacemaker, 
implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) and cardiac resynchronization (CRT) 
therapy. St Jude Medical AB, Sweden is part of the CRMD division and the site has 
about 700 employees and is based in Veddesta, northwest of Stockholm. 
3.1.1. Company Vision 
St Jude Medical develops medical technology and services with the aim of increasing 
control for those who treat cardiac, neurological and chronic pain worldwide.  
3.2. The Functional Organization 
The Leads Department is an organization consisting of functional groups 
working with the product development. The department is cross-functionally 
organized and have a process oriented working methodology.  
3.3. The Product Development Process  
Product development at The company AB is mainly conducted in development 
projects using cross-functional teams and a process with defined stages and gates 
from research or conceptualization phase to the transfer of the product to the market. 
The product development process in the Veddesta Leads department at SJM is divided 
into three main stages with their different processes. Theses stages start with the COP 
process, 
proceeds 
to 
Technology 
Development 
process 
and 
ends 
with 
Productification, see Figure 4.  
12 
 
 
Figure 4 - Overview of the product development process  
In the COP process, ideas in their earliest stages are evaluated and knowledge about 
their feasibility is created. The COP projects are typically small in terms of resources 
and time. The Technology process also evaluates ideas in early stages but the projects 
are larger in terms of resources and time compared to the COP projects. The 
productification process is the process connected to the product launch. 
3.4. Meeting forums 
The formal meeting forums, at the Leads department at SJM, concerning the decision 
making process for COP projects will be explained briefly. The explanation will 
mostly focus on the importance to the COP Decision Making Process. The meeting 
forums of interest for the Master Thesis are the Tactics forum, the Strategy forum, the 
Technology Mapping Forum and the COP board. Even though the Tactics and the 
Strategy meetings are two separate forums they are seen as one in this thesis, known 
as the ST forum. The reason for this is since, in the matter of PPM, both forums 
basically brings up the same topics but only in different time intervals. However, the 
two different forums will be explained in the following text. 
3.4.1.  The Strategy forum 
The Strategy forum concerns long-term questions regarding the strategy for the Leads 
department at SJM in Veddesta.  
3.4.2. The Tactics forum 
The Tactics forum discusses questions regarding the tactics of the Leads department. 
One main difference is that this is a more operational meeting and takes greater 
concern to which projects to run in comparison to the Strategy meeting. Decisions 
Conceptualization
(COP)
Technology 
Development
Productification
13 
 
regarding which COP project to start and which to put in the COP Inbox, a list of 
COP projects waiting to be started, are taken in this meeting.  
3.4.3. The Technology Mapping Forum 
The Technology Mapping Forum (TMF) is seen as an idea management forum. It 
involves members of a group of people who constantly scans different horizons for 
new ideas. One of the main purposes of the forum is to map all the ideas that are 
potential COP projects. The mapping is done by identification and evaluation of the 
collected ideas.  
3.4.4. The COP Board 
The COP Board is the most operational meeting since it makes detailed levelled 
decisions about the ongoing projects. The meeting involves the project managers who 
present their procedures to the board. The meeting executes the decisions taken at the 
ST Forum.  
3.5. Idea Management at St. Jude Medical AB, Sweden 
Ideas emerge from a multitude of different areas and persons i.e. engineers at the field 
with close customer contact, group members working in a development project among 
others etc. There is also an eminent difference between individual ideas, covering 
everything from small changes in the work area to major product changes. There are 
also several different ways for ideas to become a project. However, the ideas need to 
be collected and formalized. SJM uses several different IT-solutions to collect ideas.

4. PROJECT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT 
This theoretical chapters aims to give the reader a thorough understanding of Project 
Portfolio Management. The chapter presents the motivation and background (4.1) of 
PPM, definition and PPM in general (4.2). The following sections present the 
different tools and methods in a PPM process (4.3) and how these are implemented 
(4.4). The final section presents some recommendations from literature (4.5) when 
implementing a PPM process.  
4.1. Motivation and Background to PPM 
In a former conducted research, some Swedish companies argued that they had 
difficulties when creating new products and ideas (Gutiérrez, 2008). What the 
research later on revealed was that the companies had numerous ideas for new 
products, technologies and markets. The actual problem was decision-making and 
how to choose among all the already existing ideas.  
Many organizations today experience difficulties regarding the selection of R&D 
projects and ideas. A great number of companies do not use any selection criteria to 
separate the weak projects from the potentially successful ones, which in the end leads 
to a poor portfolio (Elonen & Artto, 2002). Resources are basically too limited to be 
allocated to weak projects (Wheelwright & Clark, 1992). As a result, organizations 
need to define priorities and allocate their resources to the right ideas in order to have 
a high return of value for the resources put in (Archer & Ghamsamzadeh, 1996). A 
continually occurred problem is that many companies face difficulties in this choice 
and the result is too many ongoing projects in relation to available resources (Centre 
for Business Practices, 2003).  
When analyzing the costs of choosing the wrong idea, the importance of choosing the 
right one becomes very clear. The costs of such a failure include two types; the 
resources put spent on the wrong project and the opportunity cost of potential projects 
that might have succeeded if resources were to be allocated to them. The decision to 
allocate resources to the right projects is a crucial decision when managing R&D 
project portfolios (Martino, 1995).  
One important area in project portfolio management is strategic alignment. The 
literature shows that successful development needs to have a strong connection with 
the company’s overall strategies (Castellion, 2005).  
Another important area that needs to be taken into consideration by managerial roles 
in R&D operations is the balancing of projects and resources in terms of a number of 
parameters (Cooper et al, 1998). Decision makers tend to select short-term and “easy” 
projects, which lowers the organizations competitive advantage (Elonen & Artto, 
2002). According to Cooper it is for example important to have a portfolio including a 
15 
 
number of long-term projects versus short-term projects, high-risk versus low-risk, 
different product types, across various markets etc. 
4.1.1. Goals of Project Portfolio Management 
There are constantly four goals that re-occur in portfolio management literature. By 
fulfilling these goals, companies are on the right way of preventing the difficulties 
presented in the previous chapter. Figure 5 illustrates and summarizes the goals of 
project portfolio management. 
 
Figure 5 - The four overall goals of Project Portfolio Management 
Maximization of Value includes selecting the right projects and allocating resources to 
them in order to maximize the value of the portfolio. Achieving a Balanced Portfolio 
refers to what also was said in the previous chapter, it is important to have the ability 
to select the right mix of projects today in order to be successful in tomorrows market 
(Cooper et al, 2001a). Strategic Alignment takes into account the importance that all 
projects reflect the overall company strategy. Right Number of Projects involves the 
importance to be able to kill projects and not initiating more projects than the 
available resources (Cooper et al, 1998). 
4.1.2. Criticism Against Project Portfolio Management 
Even though project portfolio management is seen as an important approach for 
decision-making and managing R&D operations, some criticism exist and therefore it 
is important to mention these in this thesis. An often occurring criticism is that an 
implemented portfolio management process often does not work as it is intended to do 
in the literature (Spradlin & Kutoloski, 1999).  
Another interesting critique to bring up is that it is only possible to manage a portfolio 
of projects only to some extent. Regardless of rules and a systematic process, there

16 
 
will always be some specific projects running without the knowledge of management 
(Blichfeldt & Eskerod, 2005). A good example of this critique is personnel working 
with R&D that may not want to accept the decision to kill a specific project or a group 
of persons that carry out a project on a hidden agenda because of their interest for that 
specific project.  
4.2. Portfolio Management in General 
The following sections give the reader a definition of Project Portfolio Management, a 
complex decision process. The sections also discuss PPM in relation to new product 
development and innovation management.  
4.2.1. Definition of Project Portfolio Management 
Few formal definitions of PPM exist since the area is rather recently established if one 
looks at it from a broader view. The following definition of PPM is on the other hand 
one that re-occurs in literature:  
Project portfolio management is a dynamic process wherein the list of 
active projects is constantly revised. In this process, new projects are 
evaluated, selected and prioritized; existing projects may be 
accelerated, killed or deprioritized, and resources are allocated and 
reallocated among the projects in the portfolio. The portfolio decision 
process is characterized by uncertain and changing information, 
dynamic opportunities, multiple goals and strategic considerations, 
interdependence among projects, and multiple decision-makers and 
locations (Cooper & Edgett, 2001b). 
4.2.2. PPM – A Complex Decision Process 
There are many tools and techniques available to help organizations implement a 
portfolio process but since PPM is a complex managerial task there is almost no 
integrated framework that considers all different aspects when determining a project 
portfolio for a specific organization (Archer & Ghasamzadeh, 1996). According to 
Archer & Ghasamzadeh, some of the complicating aspects involved when implement 
a PPM process is: 
 The overall goals and objectives of PPM often conflict with each other 
 Projects at different maturity stages are compared 
 Several individuals and decision makers with different perceptions are 
involved 
4.2.3. PPM in Relation to the New Product Development Process 
For a successful portfolio management it is essential to make sure that the new 
product process will work well with the PPM process, especially the gating system 
(Cooper et al, 1998). The purpose of the gating system is to kill or filter out the weak 
17 
 
projects in order to achieve a better portfolio. This is often a re-occurring issue at 
many organizations and an ineffective gate criteria leads to a situation where many 
projects are getting their own life. At each gate there should be clear and formal 
Go/Kill and prioritization criteria to prevent the mentioned problem. 
4.2.4. PPM in Relation to Innovation Management 
One of the factors for a successful implementation of innovation is flexibility and 
speed in decision making (Mikkola, 2001). The project portfolio approach of dealing 
with several R&D projects forces managers from different functions to reach 
consensus between R&D in regard to innovation management. To get new 
technological competencies through R&D also gives the company as whole, new 
technological competences.  
The complexity of innovation management encourages subjective evaluations of R&D 
projects from strategic managers of different functions to reach consensus by allowing 
flexibility in setting, often broad, specifications and goals. The details of the projects 
such as product specifications, marketing strategies, logistics targets, production 
technologies, etc. are often set after consensus has been reached. Subjectivity is a 
necessary condition for analyzing a portfolio of R&D projects, precisely because the 
requirements of R&D are quite different. 
4.3. Supporting Tools and Methods for PPM 
There are a great number of tools and methods available today that can be used to 
evaluate, prioritize and select ideas and project. Even so, they are not that frequently 
used since most of them are basically too complex and/or require a great amount of 
input data that many time does not exist at a certain stage of development (Archer & 
Ghasamzadeh, 1999). Before describing these tools and methods the following 
chapter will briefly discuss the different ways of categorizing and classifying these 
techniques.  
4.3.1. Classification of Tools and Methods 
It can easily be seen in the literature that different authors classify the methods in 
different ways in order to support their research. One example of such a classification 
is to divide the different tools in two groups (Linton et al, 2000): 
Multiple-Criteria Decision-Making Methods: The tools found in this group rate the 
projects individually according to a number of criteria such as technical success, 
commercial success etc. Usually the result of such an evaluation is a rank-ordered list 
of projects in order of importance, not taking the whole project portfolio into 
consideration. 
Subjective Decision-Making Methods: The tools that are found in the subjective group 
give the managers an overall picture of the project composition. They are supposed to 
guide the managers in their decision and are not an actual decision method per se.  
18 
 
However, the most appropriate way to classify these tools for this thesis is when they 
are related to the overall goals of project portfolio management. This classification is 
also the most frequently found in the literature and can be seen in Figure 6. The 
following chapter will to some extent describe the different tools that can be found in 
each area. An important note is that there are a great number of tools existing today in 
these areas. However, the ones that most frequently are used and are most relevant for 
this thesis are brought up.  
 
 
Figure 6 - Different tools and methods for support project portfolio 
management (developed from Cooper & Edgett, 2001b) 
4.3.2. Maximizing Value of Portfolio 
These methods evaluate individual projects and are mostly financial tools. In theory 
the projects with the highest financial values are the ones that give the portfolio 
maximum value (Cooper, 2002). Such financial tools are Net Present Value (NPV) 
and Economic Commercial Value (ECV). These tools are actually the most frequently 
used ones (Cooper, 2002) but they should be used with some care (Cooper et al, 1998) 
since estimates concerning financial values usually are difficult to make and have a 
low reliability. These estimations involve much uncertainty, especially during early 
phases of development. Further on, if unreliable input data is used the result of the 
calculations become even more uncertain (Cooper & Edgett, 2001b). Purely economic 
tools such as NPV and ECV will not be described in this thesis since the thesis scope 
includes COP projects at SJM which basically are early R&D projects. The needed 
data for these tools do not usually exist at such an early stage of the product

development process.  For further inquires regarding the financial tools see 
Appendix 5.  
Another type of tool that can be found reaching for this goal are Scoring Models. The 
model includes projects being evaluated and then scored based upon a set of defined 
criteria. The scorings are then summarized and the result is an overall value of a 
specific project (Cooper & Edgett, 2001b). Scoring models have demonstrated 
themselves to be useful at early stages of the product development process (Ullman, 
2004). They enable the use of a structured method even at the idea stage for the 
evaluation of future projects.  
4.3.3. Achieving a Balanced Portfolio 
Another group of tools are constructed to support the objective of reaching a balanced 
portfolio. The correct balanced portfolio is specific for each company and is highly 
dependant on the company’s business strategy (Power, 1986). The actual tools that are 
used are different types of visualization tools and they are not decision tools, instead 
they are used as a guide for discussion about which projects that should be selected 
(Dawidson, 2006). Different examples of these tools include pie charts, histograms, 
portfolio charts and bubble diagrams. These illustrations are constructed based upon a 
number of parameters such as risk versus revenues, technical difficulty to conduct 
versus importance, advantages versus costs etc (Cooper & Edgett, 2001b). According 
to EIRMA (2002), bubble diagrams are the most frequently used types of diagrams 
and an example of such an illustration is seen in Figure 7, which compares the 
projects probability of technical success versus the pay-off, in this case the NPV.  
20 
 
 
Figure 7 - Example of a Bubble Diagram (Developed from Cooper, 2002) 
The Pearls in the diagram are potential projects with a high probability of success and 
en expected high reward. Oysters are projects with a great expected pay-off by they 
are not likely to be technically realized. Simple short-term projects with a high 
probability of success but low reward are known as Bread and Butter and White 
Elephants are projects with low reward and low likelihood of success. These last 
mentioned projects do exist and are often hard to kill. These types of visualizations 
can also take into account an amount of fuzziness or uncertainty which illustrates by 
the circles stretching out, see Figure 8, (Cooper et al, 1998). 
 
 
21 
 
 
Figure 8 - Bubble diagram including parameters of uncertainty 
A criticism against these types of tools is that they have a tendency to produce 
information overload (Cooper & Edgett, 2001b). Many times diagrams consist of too 
many parameters, which make the illustration difficult to manage and hard to read. 
Further on, not only do visualizations such as bubble diagrams illustrate companies’ 
competitive position of projects. It also illustrates gaps and areas that need further 
improvement, e.g. illustrated by an empty area in the diagram.  
4.3.4. Ensuring Strategic Alignment 
The third set of tools that are presented here are the ones that support the strategic 
direction of the projects. Usually there are two different types of approaches; the Top-
Down Approach and the Bottom-Up Approach (Cooper, 2001b). 
The top-down approach is constructed to ensure that the money spent on projects 
reflects the overall business strategy. This approach relies on management decisions 
22 
 
which are many times experienced difficult. With constant new emerging markets it is 
hard to predict future products and know how to divide the money across different 
projects (Dawidson, 2006) 
On the contrary, a bottom-up approach begins with projects and selects the projects 
that are best aligned with the business strategy. This could for example be done by 
using scoring models and including a strategic criterion in the model.   
On the other hand, many organizations use the iterative approach a combination of the 
top-down and the bottom-up one. Further on, this approach is seen by the literature as 
the most appropriate one to use (Cooper, 2001b). 
4.3.5. Right Number of Projects 
Many companies today suffer from having too many ongoing projects relative to the 
limited available resources (Cooper et al, 1998). The result is what is known as a 
Pipeline Gridlock where projects are queued and they take too long to reach the 
market. Two different approaches to ensure a balance between resources required for 
projects and available resources are, according to Cooper, Resource Limits and 
Resource Capacity Analysis.  
The approach of the resource limits methods involves including a resource limitation 
in the scoring model when ranking projects. In that way one may rank the projects 
until out of resources. The same principle can be used in bubble diagrams where the 
sum of the area of each bubble represents the resources and adding one project to the 
diagrams requires the deletion of another. 
When using a resource capacity analysis the resource demands are determined and 
the projects are prioritized. Then the resources are determined that are required by the 
departments for ongoing projects. This enables an overview of the available resources 
per department and suggests a resource limit. Further on, the approach identifies 
which departments that have insufficient resources.  
4.4. Implementation of Supporting Tools and Methods 
This chapter focuses on the implementation of the supported tools and methods 
described earlier and how they are practiced in organizations according to the 
literature. 
4.4.1. Choice and Use of Tools and Methods 
Which methods and tools used to fulfil a project portfolio management process 
depends on the number of projects in the portfolio and the environment of the 
portfolio, hence it is company specific (Bridges, 1999). Further on, there is no single 
tool or method that will do better than others when attempting to fulfil PPM goals 
(Cooper, 1999). In contrary, the suggested approach is to use a combination of tools 
and not only rely on one (EIRMA, 2002). Studies have proven that the best-
performing companies use 2-3 tools on average (Centre for Business Practices, 2003). 
23 
 
4.4.2. Stakeholders 
Different people in the organization have different views upon PPM (Cooper et al, 
1998).  This depends on the different perspectives; the person who sets the strategy 
for the product development sees it as the development of a strategically aligned 
portfolio, the economist sees it as a way to allocate recourses in an effective and 
optimal way, the engineer sees PPM as a way of selecting the “right” projects, 
marketing hopes that it will lead to shorter time-to-market etc.  
4.4.3. Practices and Performances 
Over the past 30 years published literature has shown many different approaches and 
methods for portfolio management and project selection. Even so, there is little 
evidence if those approaches are widely practiced and if they have any positive results 
(Elonen & Artto, 2002). 
It is clear that financial approaches are the tools that are most widely used. 
Surprisingly it is as clear that the results that they produce are at an uncertain level. 
The major difficulties for these approaches are as previously mentioned the amount of 
data required. A lot of such financial information is not available at early stages and 
when it is its reliability is not high. According to Elonen & Artto, strategic methods 
combined with scoring models provide good results and the best portfolios. 
Recent studies shows that the average problem areas from management levels 
regarding PPM is (Elonen & Artto, 2002): 
 The portfolio method is not particularly efficient 
 It is not realistic in capturing key facets of the decision problem 
 The method is not particularly user friendly and easy to use 
 It is not well understood by senior management 
The same study analyzed what factors that differentiate the best performers from the 
weaker performing companies. Three significant aspects were found: 
 The best performing companies sees PPM as very important 
 They have an established and formal method for PPM and treat all projects 
together as a portfolio 
 They do not rely on one single method. They tend to use multiple portfolio 
methods, e.g. strategic approaches combined with bubble diagrams and scoring 
models 
 
 
 
24 
 
4.5. Recommendations from Literature 
The previous chapters have shown that product portfolio management is a vital part of 
the product development process. Some guidelines are given in the literatures that are 
to follow when it comes to the choice or composition of a PPM process. Not all 
propositions are stated here but the relevant ones for this thesis are (Archer & 
Ghasamzadeh, 1996) 
 The selected framework should be flexible so that the involved stakeholders 
can choose in advance which methods and tools they are comfortable in  
 The portfolio selection process should be organized into a number of stages 
enabling the involved decision makers to logically move toward progress and 
results 
 Involved users should not be overloaded with unnecessary data, but should be 
able to access information when in need 
 A screening process of the ideas should be used, based on carefully defined 
criteria. This enables weak ideas to be eliminated before actually undergoing 
the selection process        
 
 
25 
 
5. PPM PROCESS DEVELOPMENT 
The 
following 
sections 
will 
describe 
the 
results 
from 
two 
different 
learning/development stages. Section 5.1 presents the results from the interview 
analysis. The Focus Group participated and thereby contributed with the data. The 
data analysis and the process mapping were conducted by the authors. Section 5.2 
presents the results from the discussion meeting and the conducted workshop.  
5.1. Current Decision Process 
The chapter will present the general perspective of the decision environment rather 
than specific individual perspectives. The identification of the current decision 
environment was not purely linear hence some of the results were confirmed during 
the meetings with the supervisors and on the discussion meeting with the Work 
Group. The discussion was held after the interviews were completed.  
As previously mentioned, the conducted interviews with the Focus Group were used 
by the authors to map the current PPM process at SJM.  Figure 9 is a visualization of 
this process. 
26 
 
 
 
Figure 9 - Illustration of the current PPM process 
27 
 
The mapped process focuses on and follows the idea itself and its ways to become a 
potential COP project. The mapped process includes three major forums where the 
idea will flow through. These are the TMF, the ST forum and the COP Board 
meeting.  
5.1.1. Idea Input 
As it can be seen in the above figure the process starts with an idea cloud representing 
the different sources ideas may come from. The most frequently identified sources of 
ideas were; when an individual submits an idea to the TMF, when ideas are a result 
from customer feedback and when ideas are found in the different IT-solutions, 
mentioned in Chapter 3.5. 
The purpose of the TMF, which is previously explained, is to find these ideas from 
different areas throughout the organization and to collect them. The collected ideas at 
the TMF are described by a form either filled out by the submitter or by the members 
of the TMF.  
5.1.2. Evaluation 
During their meetings, the TMF conducts an evaluation of these ideas and decides 
which of these that should continue the process to the ST forum or should be further 
elaborated. When evaluating, there seem to be a lack of formal criteria. Many 
decisions are made informally and are based upon discussion and what seems right at 
the moment. The interviews showed that a set of formal criteria is asked for in order 
to increase the understanding of the decisions taken. The research also gave rise to the 
fact that that a group of formal criteria actually exist at the TMF but they are not 
frequently used. Further on, according to the interviews the lack of data and facts 
regarding ideas at an early stage makes it difficult to use support methods such as 
NPV and ECV when evaluating and selecting ideas.  
5.1.3. Prospect Inbox 
The ideas of potential COP projects that do pass the evaluation at the TMF are sent to 
the ST Forum. At this point the list of ideas is referred to as the Prospect Inbox. The 
list of ideas undergoes further evaluation through a discussion.  This time they are 
evaluated based upon broader questions, such as resource allocation, strategic 
alignment, comparison against ongoing and other potential projects etc. Nevertheless, 
this discussion is again conducted without the aid of any formal tools such as scoring 
models or balance diagrams. The discussion strives to reach consensus based upon the 
decision-makers knowledge and competence in the area.  
5.1.4. Decision Making 
The decision if an idea should be a COP project or not, is taken at the ST forum. 
When the decision is taken it is passed on to the COP Board, which basically executes 
the decision and starts the project.  
28 
 
The interviews showed that there are some members of the staff that reoccur at both 
the TMF, the ST and at the COP Board. This influences the flow of information and 
makes it possible to execute a decision before notification on a ST Forum. However, 
the list of projects that should be started is already set by the members of the ST 
Forum.  
5.1.5. Strategic Alignment 
During the discussion it was said that many COP projects do not have perfectly stated 
objectives. There was said to be a lack of a visible connection between the ongoing 
projects and both the strategy and the balance of the portfolio. 
There was a common understanding of the prioritized technical areas in which 
projects were conducted. Even if it was not specifically visually connected to the 
strategy of the department, the interviewees connected the questions regarding 
strategy to these technical areas. A fit with these areas were seen as a criterion for 
project initiation. 
5.1.6. Communication 
The interviews showed that the project members and the project managers ask for the 
motivation for each COP project and its objectives. Sometimes the reason for a 
project initiation is not clear which can result in a lack of motivation.  
The interviews also showed that the existence of the TMF forum, the procedures 
regarding idea evaluation and the project initiation decision was not enough 
communicated to many of the project members and project managers. 
The different actors, such as members of the different meeting forums, staff external 
to Leads, project members and project managers, generally lacked information 
regarding the different process steps they were not a part of. 
Further on, the master thesis team participated at a meeting involving the whole 
department. The different project statuses were briefly summarized during this 
meeting and the attendees could view visual facts about the project on a white board. 
This information was constantly updated and could be viewed by anyone whenever 
they wanted. However, there was no visual information about the strategy, balance, 
potential projects, motivation for projects or similar information that could be linked 
to a PPM-process. 
5.2. Endorsement and Development of the PPM Process 
The following chapters will describe how the mapped PPM process came to be 
developed with the Work Group, supported by the discussion meeting and the 
workshop.  
The process that was mapped by the authors was basically approved with some minor 
changes. The focus came to be on the different meeting forums in the process and 
29 
 
their procedures. The interview results had shown that decisions are mainly based 
upon discussions rather than formal methods and criteria. Consequently, the task was 
to develop tools and methods, together with the Work Group, that would support 
decisions regarding idea selection and prioritization.  
5.2.1. Selection Criteria 
Present Situation 
The interview results had previously shown that a set of formal criteria did exist but 
they were not frequently used by the TMF when evaluating ideas. The TMF had 
previously constructed close to 40 criteria that were to be used for the evaluation of 
ideas but the large number of criterion made it complicated to evaluate each idea. 
Instead these criteria were combined and the results were five more broad criteria. 
Moreover, these criteria were not either significantly used since it seemed to be 
challenging to use non-specific criteria to evaluate an idea at an early stage. 
Acceptance from Management  
The purpose of the workshop was to, together with the Work Group, identify and 
define criteria for selection and evaluation of ideas. By involving the decision-makers 
in this process and allowing them to define criteria, the possibility that criteria will be 
used will increase. The acceptance from the management is highly emphasized in the 
literature and in the PM methodology. Therefore the master thesis team aimed at 
making the selection and customization of these by leading a workshop with the Work 
Group as participants, a group that mainly consisted of management. 
Selection Criteria Workshop: Results 
Initially the Work Group was divided into two smaller groups, group 1 and 2, which 
were asked to rank six given ideas in order of importance. The six ideas that were 
used during the workshop were six existing and real ideas provided by SJM. These 
ideas will hereby be represented by the letters A to F. The ideas differed from each 
other in several ways such as level of maturity, technical area, etc. The ideas were 
also perceived in different ways by the Work Group members.  
Table 2 presents the results of the rankings. It is clearly seen that the two groups, both 
consisting of decision makers, ranked the ideas completely different, e.g. one group 
ranked idea F as number one whilst the other group ranked the same idea as the least 
important one.

The second part of the selection criteria workshop consisted of the group defining a 
number of selection criteria in order to finally agreeing on what came to be nine 
criteria. The initial list of criterion, after the deletion of similar ones, is presented in

Differentiation of Criteria by Addition of Weights 
During the last part of the workshop the workgroup assigned additional weights to the 
criteria depending of the varied importance they considered the criteria should 
receive. One of the sub-groups found it hard to work with weighted criteria, whilst the 
other group had no problem assigning additional weights.  The problem was mostly 
grounded in the discussion regarding the actual meaning of the specific criteria. 
Uncertainty in the Scoring Process 
A re-occurring theme during the workshop was the uncertainty and difficulty the 
participants were experiencing during the evaluation and scoring of the ideas. Some 
of the ideas were basically at such an early stage that it was difficult scoring them 
based upon the defined criteria. Instead, it was suggested by the workgroup that this 
uncertainty should in some way be included in the results when conducting an 
evaluation of ideas, instead of being ignored. Two ways of including uncertainty arose 
during the workshop.  
When a specific project does not fulfil a criterion or the uncertainty is too high, even 
though there exist interesting facts about the project in general or in regarding of a 
specific criteria; the letter “I” for Interesting with an explanation would create the 
possibility to add additional remarks into the discussion about the project, see Figure 
11.

During the evaluation it was clear that some of the ideas were much easier to set a 
score on than others, basically since the former ones included more facts and were 
more developed ideas. Comparing the overall scores of the two groups of ideas would 
lead to incorrect results. Instead one could start by categorizing the ideas into levels of 
certainty in order to compare the same kind of ideas to each other.   
Visualizing Results from the Decision Matrix 
The authors further suggested a way of visualizing the results of the decision matrix, 
which would present the results more effectively than the filled out matrix itself. The 
suggestion can be seen in Figure 12. 
 
Figure 12 - Illustration of results from the decision matrix 
The figure effectively illustrates on which criteria a specific idea needs to improve. 
The right side of the figure presents the total score of a specific idea, the same results 
that would have been shown if a decision matrix would be filled out. The illustration 
38 
 
takes into account that an idea does not necessarily need to be a great one just because 
it has a high total score. One needs to take in account all individual scores for each 
criteria and not only base decisions upon the total sum.  
5.2.2. Balance Criteria  
The second part of the whole day workshop included identifying and defining criteria 
used when balancing the portfolio. The same six ideas were used but this time they 
were seen as ongoing projects. The two separate groups got instructed to visualize 
these projects into any diagrams of their choice were the task itself included defining 
the dimensions of the axles, e.g. comparing two projects in the space created by two 
criteria.  
To give further inspiration, the moderators showed the Work Group some different 
types of diagrams found in the literature and constructed by the authors themselves. 
These can be found in Appendix 7.  
Balance Diagrams 
The developed balanced diagrams are presented and explained in the following text. 
The first matrix, Figure 13, contains nine squares where the projects can be mapped in 
consideration of the level of risk in comparison to which type of strategy it fulfils. The 
same project could be in several strategy squares as well as none. However, the level 
of risk could only be represented throughout no more than one row; see Project A in 
Figure 13. The best projects were the ones represented in every strategy field at the 
suitable level of risk.  
 
Figure 13 - Level of risk versus type of strategy 
39 
 
The second matrix, see Figure 14, is displaying the number of involved departments 
which was one criteria combined with the level of innovation. This data is taken 
directly from the decision criteria matrix. A project could only be represented by one 
square since the criteria are of a yes/no type. The decision regarding which project to 
launch depends on the level of innovation and the preferred number of involved 
departments. This specific matrix is fulfilling the fact that balance diagrams should 
only be seen as a decision-making support.  
 
 
Figure 14 - Number of Involved Departments versus Level of Innovation 
The third matrix, see Figure 15, see displayed the Costumer Value in relation to the 
Effect of each project. The projects could effect several costumers but only have one 
level of costumer value. This made it possible for a project to be in several rows but 
only in one column. 
 
40 
 
Figure 15 - Costumer Value versus Effect 
The second group created four diagrams of a different type. The first diagram, see 
Figure 16, contained the Strategic Alignment criteria on one axis and the Possibility to 
Verification on the other. The scores for each scale were taken directly from the 
decision-making matrix. The Work Group named the squares created by the axels 
depending on which conclusions they could draw from the combination of criteria. 
The conclusions concerned the possibility to get the support from the management to 
start a project. For example it is Easy to Start a project that has a high strategic 
alignment but insecurity regarding the validation method. It is Easy to Sell, e.g. 
convince the management to support the project, if there is both strategic alignment 
and a validation method. 
 
 
 
Figure 16 - Strategic Alignment versus Possibility to Validate 
The second diagram, see Figure 17, displayed the Costumer Value in relation to the 
Strategic Alignment. The diagram is used as a discussion material regarding the 
importance of the combination of values regarding these criteria. The preferred 
projects are the ones with a high strategic alignment and a high costumer value.  
 
41 
 
 
Figure 17 - Costumer Value versus Strategic Alignment 
The third diagram, see Figure 18, shows the Costumer Value in comparison to the 
Possibility to Verification the project. High scores on both of the axis represented 
High Customer Satisfaction and low scores represented No Costumer Satisfaction.  
 
42 
 
 
Figure 18 - Costumer Value versus Possibility to Verification 
The fourth diagram included two more dimensions, see Figure 19. The placement of 
the project was decided by the Time to Effect and the Customer Value criteria. 
Additional information was added regarding a low score on the Strategic Alignment 
and a high score on the Possibility to Validate criteria. By doing so, the group could 
see if there was a good strategic alignment of the projects giving high/low costumer 
value and a certain time to effect. Additionally, the diagram displayed the possibility 
to validate the projects.  
 
43 
 
 
Figure 19 - Time to Effect versus Costumer Value in combination with 
Strategic Alignment and Possibility to Validate 
The Work Group got instructed to “kill” two ongoing projects by using the diagrams 
just constructed. By using the diagrams in this way it enabled the group to initiate a 
discussion in order to agree on three types of diagrams that they found to be the most 
useful ones. These chosen diagrams were Figure 13, Figure 14 and Figure 19.

6. NEW PPM PROCESS 
The chapter presents the final PPM process developed by the authors. The different 
meeting forums and its actions are explained step by step. 
The actual process and its different stages previously mapped, see Figure 20, has not 
been changed. On the other hand, this chapter focuses on each meeting forum and 
describes the actions and the procedures recommended at each stage. 
6.1. Idea Cloud - Initial Input 
The ideas that exist in the company are represented by the Idea Cloud. There are 
several different idea management and idea collection systems that are included in the 
Idea Cloud. 
6.2. Idea Cloud and Technology Mapping Forum Interface 
The TMF has a form that is used when someone is submitting an idea to the forum. 
This is used to collect ideas from anyone in the staff. The members of the TMF also 
systematically search for ideas in different areas.  
6.3. Technology Mapping Forum 
The first forum the ideas have to face is the TMF. The ideas are collected by the 
participants of the TMF and stored in the database called Idea Inbox. The purpose of 
the TMF is to collect, evaluate and forward the ideas most suitable to become 
projects.  
45 
 
 
Figure 20 - New Developed PPM Process 
46 
 
6.3.1. Activities 
1. The ideas undergo an evaluation. This is done by filling out a decision matrix with 
pre-defined criteria, see Figure 10. 
2. Secondly, balance diagrams are designed from the criteria and idea data, see Figure 
13 to Figure 19.  
3. A discussion about the ideas is initiated with the purpose to select the ones that will 
continue to the following meeting. These ideas and the designed diagrams including 
these projects are then passed on to the ST Forum. The ones that do not pass will 
remain in the Idea Inbox. 
6.4. Strategic & Tactical Meeting 
All ideas that pass the evaluation of the TMF are placed in the Prospect Inbox. The 
Prospect Inbox is the second database. 
6.4.1. Activities 
1. The first activity in this meeting is to perform a balance review of the ideas. This is 
done by a discussion about the ideas with help from the previously designed balance 
diagrams, see Figure 13 to Figure 19. 
2. The next step is to identify eventual areas where there is a lack of ideas. This is 
again done with the support of the constructed diagrams. These diagrams are also 
reviewed in regard to ongoing projects, either by having the represented in the same 
diagram or in an additional set of diagrams. 
3. The identified gap may be filled, either by initiating an innovation process or by 
updating the TMF forum regarding the issue. There might be ideas in that area in the 
Idea Inbox or if such an idea arrives at the Inbox it will be sent forward. 
4. The ST forum will also review strategies in order to continually update the Strategic 
Alignment criteria, which is used at the TMF forum. This is a document containing 
the strategies in different strategy levels. This document was never constructed 
during the master thesis; hence it is seen as an important further recommendation.  
5. At this point, a discussion will be initiated regarding which ideas that should be 
future projects and forwarded to the COP Board. 
6.5. COP Board 
Finally, the selected ideas from the ST meeting are collected in the COP Inbox which 
basically is a list of projects that are to be initiated in a certain order.  
The board will also continually receive updates regarding ongoing projects. This 
information will in turn be communicated to the ST meeting which can, based on the 
information, kill ongoing projects in order to initiate others.  
47 
 
7. SUMMARY OF PROBLEMS, RESULTS AND 
SOLUTIONS 
This chapter summarizes the problems and its solutions also referring to the theory 
presented in chapter 4.  The problem sections consist of the present situation, 
reference to literature, the solution and its benefits and the rationale behind the 
solution. The problem areas of interest are absence of a formal PPM process (7.1), 
formal criteria implementation and adaption (7.2), balancing the portfolio (7.3), 
vague link between strategy and project selection (7.4) and right number of projects 
(7.5). The chapter conclude with additional process support methods (7.6) to be used 
in the developed PPM process.  
7.1. Absence of a Formal PPM Process 
7.1.1. Problem Background 
As previously stated, there is a lack of a formal PPM process at early stages of 
product development at the Leads department, SJM. However, an informal one does 
exist. The main issue is that an informal process is difficult to communicate. This was 
seen during the analysis of the interview data. The employees participating in one 
meeting forum lacked the knowledge of the procedures in meeting forums they did 
not participate in. The interviews also showed that the existence of the TMF, the 
procedures regarding idea evaluation and the project initiation decision was not 
communicated to many of the project members and project managers. They explicitly 
asked for a clarification of the actual decisions behind the ideas.  
The informal process was based on discussions in different meeting forums. There 
were a few decision makers who participated in all or several of these. This made it 
possible to have an informal process since the conclusions from one discussion could 
continue to the next. The informal process was highly dependant of these persons.  
7.1.2. Literature  
As emphasized throughout the thesis, the importance of a formal PPM process is a 
key factor for success. The literature also mentions that people from lower 
hierarchies, with great knowledge about the product, usually experience difficulties 
when giving input regarding their ideas. A formal process enables their input to be 
taken into consideration.    
7.1.3. Solutions & Benefits 
The main purpose of the thesis was fulfilled, i.e. developing a more visual and formal 
PPM process for the early stages of product development at the Leads department. 
The employees participated throughout the work procedure. The process has been 
visualized in the thesis. The process is also presented for the department at the final 
master thesis presentation. The authors have made it possible to further communicate 
48 
 
the formal PPM process. By doing this, all the employees are able to understand and 
improve the process and the decisions taken. A formal process is not fully dependant 
on certain individuals but rather simplifies the possibility to include new members in 
the process. 
7.1.4. Rationale 
A formal process is a fundamental part in PPM. An informal process, even though it 
is highly important, is often difficult to improve and communicate. Instead of 
neglecting it, the goal has been to formalize it by decision support tools and methods. 
Therefore, these methods should be seen as a way of supporting the already existing 
informal evaluations and not replacing them. By communicating and visualizing the 
process, all the employees are able to know which meeting forum or person he/she 
should turn to regarding decision making and even get help when submitting ideas. 
The need for the TMF as an idea management forum was supported by the interviews.  
7.2. Formal Criteria Implementation & Adaption 
7.2.1. Problem Background 
The primarily results from the interviews, and later verified by the discussion 
meeting, showed that the TMF do not use any formal criteria, even though a list of 
formal criteria do exist. The belief is that the existing criteria are too broad and it is 
too difficult to score early projects at an idea-stage. Instead, the ideas are discussed 
based upon the general competence and know-how of the participants.  
7.2.2. Literature 
According to the literature, scoring models have proven themselves to be a useful 
method when evaluating ideas at an early stage, since they offer a structured method 
instead of an informal decision process. Nevertheless, ideas at an early stage may be 
hard to score with the help of criteria, thus a scoring models should mainly be seen as 
decision support.  
The importance of designing a PPM process together with the actual decision makers 
is also mentioned in the literature. Since decision-makers are several individuals with 
different perceptions it is of great importance that these people are involved and in 
agreement when developing criteria. The importance lie in both getting the sufficient 
support from management and in the conclusion that the product portfolio process is 
company specific. The last point is depending on the environment of the portfolio as 
well as the number of projects. 
7.2.3. Solutions & Benefits 
The purpose of the conducted workshop was to, explicitly, together with the decision-
makers identify and define a number of usable criteria. Further on, each criterion was 
discussed and formalized in order to avoid any misinterpretations. This led to a set of 
criteria taking the most important aspects in consideration. The Work Group reached 
49 
 
consensus regarding the ease of implementation of these criteria. The purpose of the 
constructed criteria was for the TMF to implement these in a scoring model when 
evaluating the ideas. The “I” for Interesting was further defined, which was to be used 
when an individual found it hard to score a specific idea on a criteria.  
7.2.4. Rationale 
The members of the staff explicitly asked for tools involving selection criteria. The 
criteria based on financial estimates were not preferred as they included too much 
uncertainty in early stages.  
The literature emphasizes scoring models, as they are a structured way to evaluate 
ideas. The use of formal scoring models during the work shop gave verifying results. 
The ranking of the ideas became to be significantly more similar after using formal 
criteria.   
7.3. Vague Visual Link Between Strategy & Project Selection 
7.3.1. Problem Background 
The interviews and the discussion meeting showed that there are vague visual links 
between project selection and company strategies. Of course, the company strategy is 
an aspect every decision maker takes in to account. Nevertheless, it is highly 
important that this should be formalized, visualized and that the product strategy 
should continually be updated and revised. 
7.3.2. Literature 
In chapter 4, the importance of strategic alignment was constantly mentioned. In order 
for a company to be successful the right projects has to be pursued and they need to 
reflect the strategic priorities. A company’s strategy is a strategy when it is seen in the 
ongoing projects. 
7.3.3. Solutions & Benefits 
The solutions consist of three elements that enable a more formal and visual approach 
regarding strategic alignment. One element is reflecting a top-down approach, one 
reflecting a bottom-down approach and the third making it an iterative approach. The 
overall solution could therefore be described as a top-down-bottom-up approach.  
The ST evaluates the product portfolio balance. They get an understanding of the 
strategic alignment in the project portfolio and also the balance between the different 
areas. If there are gaps in certain strategic areas, these could be filled by initiating 
projects with that alignment. If such projects do not exist, initiatives could be taken to 
increase the number of ideas in that strategic alignment. Such an approach sees as a 
top-down one.  
The bottom-up approach was taken into consideration when the criteria “Strategic 
Alignment” was identified and defined. By defining such a criterion, each idea needs 
50 
 
to be scored and compared to the company’s strategies before continuing in the 
process of becoming a project. 
7.3.4. Rationale 
Strategy was seen as an important aspect for the Work Group. To ensure that the 
strategic alignment was fulfilled for the Leads department, the Work Group 
specifically requested a selection criterion including the strategic alignment. There 
was also a request to view the balance between different strategies and strategy 
groups.  
7.4. Balancing the Portfolio 
7.4.1. Problem Background 
The results showed that there was a need of a more formal consideration of the 
portfolio balance. The projects were not visualized in regard to for example the 
different strategic alignments or the risks. Further on, discussions regarding ongoing 
projects in relation to future ones are based upon subjective evaluations.   
7.4.2. Literature 
One of the goals with PPM is to achieve a balanced portfolio in terms of a number of 
parameters. It is important to have the ability to select the right mix of projects today 
in order to be successful in tomorrow’s market. An example of such a mix could be 
high risk versus lower risk projects.  
As the literature states, these types of visualizations also take into account an amount 
of uncertainty which makes these tools usable when evaluating projects at an early 
stage. 
7.4.3. Solutions & Benefits 
The balance diagrams are created by the TMF and are further used by the ST meeting 
to review the balance of the future and present project portfolio. Not only do these 
methods support the decision process, they also aid the Work Group in defining areas 
that are in need of improvement. As mentioned earlier, bubble diagrams may also 
identify strategic areas or gaps which are illustrated by an empty area in the diagram. 
During the workshop it was said that when eventual gaps are identified, an innovation 
team are set into action in order to generate ideas in that area. 
The ST meeting also discusses what ongoing projects that may need to be killed in 
order to leave room for future ones. Again, with the help of visualization tools such as 
bubble diagrams, this discussion will be much more supported and helpful.  
7.4.4. Rationale 
The literature and the authors emphasized the importance of a balanced portfolio. The 
portfolio balance methods that were presented for the Work Group was also aligned 
with the aim of visualising the project portfolio. Illustrations portray balance much 
51 
 
better than do numbers and lists, and so the techniques recommended by the authors 
are largely graphical in nature.  
In Chapter 4.2.4 it was said that the complexity of innovation management 
encourages subjective evaluations of R&D projects. Therefore, these recommended 
methods mentioned above should not only be used as a decision tool but also as 
decision support. They should highly support and strengthen subjective evaluations 
and the discussion in order to always leave room for reaching consensus.  
7.5. Right Number of Projects 
7.5.1. Problem Discussion 
Also mentioned in the literature is the importance of a gating system which makes 
sure that weak projects are culled out. This is also one of the main difficulties 
experienced today in several companies.  
7.5.2. Literature 
Many companies today suffer from having too many ongoing projects relative to the 
limited available resources. The result is what is known as a Pipeline Gridlock where 
projects are queued and they take too long to reach the market. If Pipeline Gridlock 
occurs, other goals such as the strategic alignment and the balancing of the portfolio 
will have a small impact on the overall success. By preventing pipeline gridlock, all 
the previous mentioned problem solutions have the possibility to be fulfilled. 
7.5.3. Solutions & Benefits 
At SJM, the problem has previously been taken into consideration by using a formal 
product development process with a gating system. 
7.6. Multiple Portfolio Methods 
An important note is that the new developed and suggested PPM process involves the 
use of several portfolio methods: e.g. approaches combined with bubble diagrams, 
scoring models and discussions. This is also highly supported by the literature and as 
it was mentioned earlier in Chapter 4, the best performing companies do not rely on 
one single method. 
 
 
52 
 
7.7. Additional Decision Process Support 
The interview study showed that motivation and clear objectives for each COP project 
is asked for. In order to support the decisions taken regarding which projects to start 
and to visualize the idea management process, the authors suggested the use of a 
visualization tool that will gradually be filled out as decision are taken, Figure 21.  
 
Figure 21 - The illustration communicates important facts and details 
regarding a certain project.  
The purpose of the illustration is to give the organization a good overview of the 
ongoing projects. This type of information should be available to everyone from 
53 
 
project participants to other employees of the organization in order to understand the 
decisions that have been taken and how the idea actually became a project.  
The poster should state and/or visualize: 
 The reason why the project has initiated 
 The objectives of the project 
 Which decisions and by whom were they made in order for the idea to develop 
into a COP project?  
 The portfolio and where the specific project is situated 
 Which business strategies the project is aligned with 
 Resource allocation 
 An overview of a time plan and mile stones

8. REQUIRED ACTIONS FOR SUCCESSFUL 
IMPLEMENTATION 
Following are recommendations that are given by the authors that should be taken 
into consideration in order to achieve a successful implementation of the PPM 
process. The recommendations are grouped according to the meeting forums.  
8.1. The Technology Mapping Forum 
 The authors recommend SJM to further develop the decision criteria. The 
definitions need to be more specified and also certain for everyone involved in 
the decision process. Further on they should be evaluated after implementation 
when the outcome from decisions is available.  
 The definition of each score needs to be more specified to make sure that the 
person that scores the project has the same preferences.   
8.2. The ST Forum 
 The criteria for the decision matrix and for the balance diagrams need to be 
further discussed. Different options should be considered during an additional 
workshop or by evaluation during the work at the TMF.  
 The projects that are sent to the ST for further evaluation should be aligned 
with the strategies and the specific areas decided by the ST. There is a criteria 
involving strategic alignment used at the TMF. However, the list of strategies 
as well as the definition of the strategies needs to be developed. 
 Since the time-constraint only made it possible to draw a few balance 
diagrams, it would be interesting to look at new ways of combining criteria. 
This proceeded work would aim at finding the preferred combination of 
criteria and diagrams. More work to define the names of column attributes is 
needed.  
 The communication regarding the updated strategy list between ST and the 
TMF need to be assured. This enables the TMF to deliver a preferable set of 
project proposals suitable to SJM. Another suggestion is that the ST forum 
reviews the list of criteria. 
8.3. Overall Recommendations 
 The authors suggest a meeting where the PPM-process is described and 
communicated visually. This is to make sure that everyone understands the 
decision making process, how ideas become projects, and which forum to turn 
to when one has an idea suggestion or needs help do develop an idea.  
 
 
55 
 
9. REFLECTIONS  
This chapter presents some overall reflections that have been concluded from the 
authors after conducting this master thesis. The reflections include different 
recommendations and conclusions regarding mapping and refining a decision making 
process at an organization.    
 Every company has their own needs and requirements; hence every PPM 
process is company specific. 
 When developing and implementing a new PPM process, it is crucial to 
involve the actual decision makers and other involved staff in the procedure, 
in order to make the PPM process well understood by management and staff. 
 Since PPM is a complex process with many involving factors, it is important 
to strive after a visual and user friendly process. The process should be 
organized into a number of stages, enabling a logically progress towards 
results.  
 Tools such as Scoring Models and Balance Diagrams should only be seen as 
decision support and not decision making tools. It is recommended to use 
these methods as a strong ground for discussions in order to reach decisions.  
 In order to develop a new PPM process, it is recommended to first map the 
current decision process at the organization, even if only an informal one 
exists. This will highly simplify the implementation of the new process at an 
already existing organization.

WORKSHOP 
1: 
SELECTION 
CRITERIA 
The following steps give the reader a good understanding of how the workshop was 
conducted.  
 
Action 
1 
The purpose of the workshop was explained and six different ideas were 
presented to the Work Group. The ideas were taken from an actual pros-
pect list in order to make sure that everyone recognized the material. 
2 
The moderators divided the Work Group into two smaller groups and in-
structed them to make a ranking of the projects in order of importance. 
They also had to motivate their rankings. 
3 
The rankings were presented to each other. 
4 
The groups were instructed to define a set of criteria that are considered 
important for evaluation potential projects. 
5 
The list of criteria was presented to each other and the moderators exem-
plified with additional criteria if the participants had ignored some areas. 
6 
The whole group was allowed to discuss the criteria in order to agree on 
one list of 5-10 criteria.  
7 
The Work Group got instructed to define a label for each criterion and 
define a description for each. Further on they had to define a scoring scale 
were each individual score was defined with a sentence.  
8 
Each group then got instructed to score the previous ideas individually by 
giving points to it, according to the previously defined criteria.  
9 
The new ranking of the projects were presented to each other and com-
pared to the previous ranking.  
10 
The Work Group was then allowed to assign additional weight to the cri-
teria if they considered that they should receive varied importance.   
11 
A final ranking was conducted using a decision matrix

Appendix 4 
WORSHOP 2: BALANCE 
The following steps give the reader a good understanding of how the workshop was 
conducted.  
 
Action 
1 
The purpose was explained and the same set of ideas was used. This time 
the ideas were seen as ongoing projects.  
2 
The two smaller groups got instructed to visualize the different projects in 
three diagrams. The task was to define the dimensions of the diagram ax-
les.  
3 
The diagrams were presented to each other 
4 
The moderators instructed the Work Group that due to some reasons the 
company must kill two ongoing projects. Each group were then allowed to 
discuss by using the diagrams which two projects to kill.  
5 
The groups then present which two projects they killed, how the diagrams 
were used and which three diagrams they found most useful 
6 
The entire Work Group then initiated a discussion with the goal of select-
ing the three most relevant diagrams.

Appendix 5 
FINANCIAL TOOLS 
Following is a brief description of the financial tools known as NPV and ECV, 
developed from Cooper, 2002. 
Net Present Value 
 
The net present value (
) takes in account the estimated foreseen cash flow in each 
period τ (Inflows 
 – Outflows
) caused by an investment, discounted to the day of 
the investment. This means that the expected interest of the money is being consid-
ered in the calculation. Neither the uncertainty of the estimations nor the risks are in-
cluded in this account. 
 
 
 
Respectively 
 
 
 
Expected Commercial Value 
 
The calculation of the ECV is based on a decision-tree-analysis and considers the fu-
ture stream of earnings from the project, the probability of both commercial and tech-
nical success, along with both commercialization costs and development costs. After 
having determined the ECV of each project, the scarce or limiting resource has to be 
defined. This could be the R&D people’s working hours for instance. The priority is 
set as follows: the ECV of each project is divided by its cost in the scarce resource 
“currency”. Then the projects are ranked according to this ECV/R&D cost ratio until 
the R&D budget limit is reached. The formula used to generate the ECV is   
 
 
 
 
ECV = expected commercial value of the project 
TS = probability of technical success 
CS = probability of commercial success 
D = development cost remaining in the project 
C = commercialization (launch) cost 
NPV = net present value of the project’s future cash flows discounted at the weighted 
average cost of capital (WACC)
