Sammanfattning 
 
Piezo injektorn är modellerad i ett examensarbete på Scania CV AB i Södertälje i GT-Fuel. 
GT-Fuel är ett simulering program och en del av GT-Suite från Gamma Technology. 
 
Simuleringen för piezo injektor modellen är uppdelade i hydromekaniska system och 
elektriska system (Piezoelectric element).  I början duplicerades den hydromekaniska 
modellen från en tidigare modell framtagen i simuleringsprogrammet ”Advance Continuous 
Simulation Language” (ACSL). Simuleringsresultat från GT-Fuel jämfördes med ACSL, detta 
gjordes för att verifiera det hydromekaniska systemet. Simuleringsresultatet från den 
elektriska modellen jämfördes med ett resultat som togs fram från en Simulink modell. Dessa 
jämförelser visar att simuleringsmodellen överensstämmer till viss del med tidigare gjorda 
modeller. 
 
Piezoelektrisk elementen i GT-Fuel är enkelt modellerad, som inte täcker alla strömkretsen i 
detta element. Begränsningen gav ett felaktigt värde på nållyft, det vill säga att modellen 
genererar ett större nållyft. De piezoelektriska elementen kan modelleras i GT-Fuel genom att 
använda andra funktioner för att modellera strömkretsen. Men detta skulle ta tid varvid 
avgränsningar gjordes.  En annan lösning var att koppla GT-Fuel modellen till Simulink 
modellen, men det var svårt att utföra.  
 
Studier och analys gjordes även kring några av de viktiga parametrar som har inverkan på 
injektorers prestanda (till exempel; injektorkroppens volym, mynnings diameter och 
passningsspel). Resultaten visade att ökning av passningsspel diameter påverkade nållyftet, 
som resulterar i att nålen stängs tidigare. En minskning av mynnings diameter resulteras i 
ändring av nållyft profilen. Med andra ord, nålstängningen är långsammare för att det tar tid 
för Control Chamber att återfyllas.   Ökning av injektorkroppens volym påverkade avsevärt 
injektorprestanda. Utan den fick man en bättre nållyftets kurva.

Abstract  
 
A piezoelectric injector was modeled, in this Master Thesis Project which was carried out at 
Scania CV AB in Södertälje, in GT-Fuel. GT-Fuel is simulation program from Gamma 
Technology.  
 
The simulation model for the piezo injector was divided into a hydro-mechanical system and 
an electrical system (Piezoelectric element). First the hydro-mechanic model was duplicated 
from Advance Continuous Simulation Language model (ACSL). The simulation results were 
then compared to the ACSL, to verify that the hydro-mechanical system was modeled 
correctly. The simulation results for the electrical model were also compared with a Simulink 
model. Comparison shows that the simulation results correspond with results from other 
simulations. 
 
The piezoelectric element in GT-Fuel is a relatively simple model, not all of the electrical 
circuits in the element are covered. This limitation gave an inaccurate value of needle 
displacement, that is to say it generates too large needle displacement.  The piezoelectric 
element can be modeled in GT-Fuel by using a couple of functions in order to model 
electrical circuit. This would take time so therefore some limitations have been made. Another 
solution would be to couple GT-Fuel to Simulink, but this was difficult to achieve.  
 
A study has been made around some significant parameters (for instance; Injector Body 
volume, orifice diameter and clearance diameter), which affect injector performance. The 
results shows that by increasing the clearance diameter affected the needle lift, which caused 
the needle to close earlier. Decreasing the orifice diameter resulted in changing the needle 
profile. In other words, the needle closes slower because it takes time to refill the Control 
Chamber. Increasing the Injector Body volume did not affect injector performance but it gave 
a better profile for the needle.

Introduction 
 
The demands of making the latest generation of diesel engine more clean and effective are 
met by using common rail injection systems and more recently piezoelectric injectors.  
 
The common rail injection system is known for it’s controllably. The system’s principle 
feature is that the injection pressure is independent of engine speed and injected fuel quantity. 
The system pressure is generated by a high pressure pump and regulated by a pressure control 
circuit, which is applied to the injector. The fuel is routed from the high pressure port via an 
inlet passage to the nozzle and via the inlet restrictor into the valve Control Chamber. The 
valve Control Chamber is connected by the outlet restrictor, which can be opened by a 
solenoid valve, to the fuel return [1].  
 
The piezoelectric stack/actuator operates on the injector needle motion via hydraulic link, 
which amplifies the motion to help complete the lift for large injections. It also generates fast 
opening and closing of the needle. This enables to inject the fuel to the combustion chamber 
faster (square injection rate profile). 
 
The main focus of this Master Thesis work was to model a piezoelectric injector in GT-Fuel. 
The mechanical and hydraulic systems were modeled. A study of the piezoelectric ceramic 
was made. Another challenge was to duplicate the Simulink model to GT-Fuel, if there was 
enough time left.       
 
Chapter one explains the hydro-mechanical model and piezoelectric element model in GT-
Fuel. Also this chapter explains how the mechanical and hydraulic systems are connected to 
the piezo element. 
 
Chapter two covers the study that has been made about the piezoelectric ceramic. This chapter 
deals with piezoelectric history, function, types and parameter constants.  
 
Chapter three is the verification of piezoelectric displacement.   
 
Finally the last chapter is about the Results and Conclusions, where the results from GT-Fuel 
were compared to the results from ACSL.

Modeling the Hydro-Mechanical System in GT-Fuel 
 
 
This capital covers topics related to modeling of the mechanical system, and the interaction 
between the mechanical and hydraulic systems. The methods of coupling fluid and 
mechanical systems are discussed.  
 
Mechanical components 
 
The most common used mechanical components are mass and ground in GT-Fuel. In order to 
connect masses and grounds to each other, connection components are used. Such as; springs, 
dampers and connection objects, which are explained below.  
 
 
Mass 
 
 
This object is used to model one-dimensional linear motion of a stiff mass acted upon by 
external forces. The forces that affect the mass/masses are modeled either by a lookup 
function object (a xy-table, time and force) or Force template. A reaction force from the 
ground object affects the mass. Masses in series are connected by springs, damper and contact 
objects [2]. 
 
The injector is divided into nine masses and some of theses masses are subdivided as well. 
The masses are; Actuator Retainer (neglected in the model), Stack Housing (neglected in the 
model), Bellow, Adapter Flange (subdivided into two masses), Upper Plunger (subdivided 
into two masses), Snubber Valve, Outer Plunger (subdivided into two masses), Refill Valve 
and Needle (subdivided into three masses).    
 
Sub-masses are connected by a spring and a damper. The spring and damper coefficients are 
different for different masses. In other words, the elastic modulus E is different. Major masses 
are connected to each other or to the ground by contact objects and to the hydraulic system by 
a mechanical flow connection object (based on their construction structure). 
 
Ground 
 
 
The Ground object is used to model a ground part with defined displacement (zero or finite 
value). The Ground, with zero value displacement, works as a stationary component. The 
Ground like the mass objects, can be connected to mechanical components by spring, damper 
or/and contact objects.  
 
The arrows linking this object with other mechanical objects, can pointed in two directions 
(toward the mass and away from the mass). The direction of the arrow decides the reaction 
forces (if the force is negative or positive), that act on the Ground. The reaction force is 
positive if the arrow pointed toward the Ground object [2].  
 
 
8
Four Ground objects are used in this model and they all work as stationary components. Two 
of these work as a start and end point for the injector. The other two work as motion 
absorbers, where the motion of other components according to the injector construction is 
diminished.  
 
Spring 
 
 
This object is used to apply a spring force that acts between two mechanical components. The 
spring force can be calculated:

Fs is spring force 
 
Fp is spring pretension 
 
k is spring rate

x2 is displacement of component 2 
 
Springs are used to define the material stiffness between the subdivided masses. The spring 
stiffness is calculated:

Where 
 
E is the Young’s Modules of the mass material 
 
A is the cross-sectional area of that part of the mass 
 
L is the length of that part of the mass 
 
The direction of the arrows represents the positive direction. The link arrow always couple 
object 1 to object 2. The positive force is applied to object 2 and reaction force to object 1. If 
the calculated force is positive then object 1 is pushing object 2, and if the force is negative 
then object 1 is pulling object 2.    
 
 
Damper  
 
 
Damper object is applied between two mechanical components (masses). The damping force 
can be calculated:

The direction of the link arrows between mechanical components represents component 
numbers and therefore the sign of the force.  
 
 
Contact 
 
 
Contact objects can be placed between two mechanical components. This object applies a 
force on the attached parts when the gap between these parts become less than zero, or greater 
than the maximum gap. This gap can be specified in object table. The force on parts will be of 
the opposite sign. The direction of the linking arrow will represent the force direction [2]. 
 
 
Mechanical system  
 
 
The mechanical system equation of movement can be solved by using the general ordinary 
differential equations (ODE) of motion as defined below. For free linear motion of a body, 
single degree of freedom, the equation can be written:

F  is the force action on the body

Hydraulic Components 
 
The most common components are; pipes, flowsplits, and end-environments. Flow 
connections are: orifice, valves, leakage and mechanical flow connections.  
 
Pipe 
 
 
The pipe object is used to model a round and straight pipe. This object models flow through 
tubes with either constant or tapered diameter.  
 
In the piezo model, three pipes are used; one of these is the high pressure line (HPL), which 
connects Rail pressure (End environment) with high pressure connections (HPC) pipes. The 
HPCs are linked to the Injector Body volume. 
 
The flow model involves solving the Navier-Stokes equations, namely the conservation of 
continuity, momentum and energy equations. These equations are solved in one dimension, 
which means that all quantities are averages across the flow direction [2].  
 
End Environment 
 
 
This object describes end environment boundary conditions of pressure, temperature and 
composition.  
 
There are three End Environment objects used in the injector model; Rail Pressure, Drain and 
Cylinder Pressure. These three objects have same boundary temperature and composition but 
the pressure is different for the drain, cylinder and Rail pressure.  
 
As mentioned previously, the End Environment for Rail pressure is connected to the pipes 
(HPL and HPC), which are attached to the Injector Body Volume. The End Environment for 
the Drain pressure is connected to the Drain Volume. The End Environment object for the 
Cylinder pressure is connected to the Sac Pressure Volume via Injection Nozzle Connection.  
 
 
 
 
 
11
Flow Split (Volume) 
 
 
This object is used to describe a volume connected to one or more flow components. When a 
finite volume has several openings (ports) it forms a flow-split. The solution of the flow-split 
is similar to the pipe. For the momentum solution, the flow-split geometry is characterized for 
each port by its expansion diameter, characteristic length and the port orientation [2]. 
 
Four Flow Split components are used to model the four volumes in the injector. These four 
volumes are connected to each other (depending on how the injector is designed), either by 
leak, valve or orifice connections. They are connected to the mechanical system by 
mechanical flow connections.  
 
The flow split general object can be used to describe any flow-split geometry. This type 
requires the most information to define the flow-split geometry, but it is also the most 
flexible. This object can have as many ports as needed to model the connections. The 
diameter, length and the direction angles of each port define the geometry of the flow-split. 
The direction angles are defined with respect to a coordinate system X, Y, Z. 
 
Therefore the four Volume ports can be explained below 
 
Drain Volume 
 
This object is used to describe the drain volume geometry and its connection to the other 
components. First the coordinate system is defined for the system (injector). The Drain 
Volume’s initial condition, inside the volume, is defined as low pressure.  
 
 
Table 1 shows the ports that are connected to the Drain Volume.

Port (2) represents the connection between Drain Volume and End Environment for Drain. 
Port (3) represents the connection between Drain Volume and the Upper Plunger (Top) mass 
via a Mechanical Flow Connection.

Injector Body Volume 
 
This object describes the Injector Body Volume geometry and its connections to the other 
components in the injector, see Table 2. The initial boundary condition for its pressure is 
defined as high pressure. The Injector Body volume extends from the needle tip to the Sleeve 
around all injector’s parts.

Port (1) connects to the Sac Volume via the nozzle seat valve. The direction of the arrow is 
important here, because this define the direction of the flow. 
Port (2) connects to the Hydraulic Volume via an annual leak connection. The link arrow 
defines the direction of the leakage, where the fluid leaks from the hydraulic volume to the 
Injector Body volume. 
 Port (3) connects to the Hydraulic Volume via an annual leak connection. The link arrow 
direction is defined as for port (2). 
Port (4) connects to the Drain Volume via an annual leak connection. The link arrow goes 
forwards the Drain volume.  
Port (5) connects to the Control Chamber Volume via an orifice connection. The orifice 
connection represents the orifice in the Snubber valve. The flow direction goes from this 
towards the Control Chamber Volume.  
Port (6) connects to the Rail pressure (end environment) via pipes (HPL and HPC) and orifice 
connections.  
Port (7) connects to the Snubber valve mass via a mechanical flow connection. The link arrow 
goes towards the Snubber valve mass.  
Port (8) connects to the Control Chamber Volume via the valve actuated lift area connection. 
The flow goes towards the Control Chamber Volume.  
Port (9) connects to the Hydraulic Chamber Volume via the valve actuated lift area 
connection. The flow goes towards the Injector Body volume.  
Port (10) connects to the Refill valve mass via a mechanical flow connection. The link arrow 
goes towards the Refill valve mass.  
Port (11) connects to the Upper Plunger mass (Bottom) via a mechanical flow connection. 
The link arrow goes towards the mass.    
 
 
13
The body volume has a big influence on injector operation. By increasing the Injector Body 
Volume, the needle lift and injection rate shapes will be improved.  
Sac Volume 
 
This Volume is modeled by a Flow-split general object. The object describes the Sac 
geometry and the ports that connect the other components, see Table 3. The initial pressure 
boundary is set to the rate pressure.  
 
Table 3 shows the ports and their respective angel, which are connected to the other 
components in the Injector Body. The angles are described according to the coordinate 
system.

Port (1) connects to the Injector Body Volume via the valve actuated lift area connection 
(Nozzle seat). The flow goes from the Injector Body volume to the sac volume.  
Port (2) connects to the Cylinder Pressure (End Environment) via the injection nozzle 
connection.  
 
Leakage 
 
 
The leakage can be defined as the lost liquid/gas from one volume to another due to the 
construction of the structure and pressure differences between these volumes. 
  
It can be classified into two types; laminar flow and turbulent flow. Laminar flow occurs 
when a fluid flows in parallel layers with no disruption between the layers and is 
characterized by high momentum diffusion, low momentum convection and pressure and 
velocity is independent of time. The turbulent flow has the opposite characteristics.  
 
Since the flow in the injector leakage is considered to be slow, it is treated as a laminar flow. 
This object models the laminar leakage flow past a cylindrical mass in a guide, sleeve or 
barrel where the clearance is a fraction of micron. The model takes into account the pressure 
differential across the element and the effect of the relative motion of the rod with respect to 
the guide. 
 
 
14
Reynolds number (Re) is an important factor in the equations that describe whether flow 
conditions lead to laminar or turbulent flow. If Re is less than 500, the flow is considered to 
be laminar. There are two types of laminar flow; non-viscous and viscous. 
  
The leakage annual radius is created by two cylindrical bodies assembled into each other. 
These cylindrical bodies are assumed to be centered, when the annual leakage is modeled.    
Leakage volumetric leak rate is calculated using a Poiseuille/Couette flow solution for flow 
between parallel plates, and is valid when δ<<D [2].

Leakage between Injector Body volume and drain volume 
 
The leakage between the Injector Body volume and drain volume is due to the pressure 
differences in the volumes.  
 
In order to calculate the volume flow rate through the annular passage, some parameters in 
that area are defined/ calculated. These parameters/values are inserted to equation (7). Then 
the values have been calculated according the injector structure.  
 
The relative velocity of the fluid is assumed to be zero because the wall (sleeve and adapter 
flange) does not move. The velocity is set to zero for all the leakage objects.  
 
 
Leakage between Injector Body volume and Hydraulic Chamber volume 
 
There are two leakages between these volumes; one between the needle and the Refill valve, 
the other between the Outer Plunger (inside) and the Outer Plunger (outside). 
 
The parameters for the leakage between the needle and the Refill valve, as in the previous 
section, can be calculated from equation (7).  
 
The relative velocity of the fluid is assumed to be zero because the wall of the Refill valve is 
assumed to be fixed.  
 
 
The parameters for the leakage between the Outer Plunger (inside) and Outer Plunger 
(outside), as before can be calculated. 
The relative velocity of the fluid is assumed to be zero because the wall of the Outer Plunger 
(outside) is fixed.  
 
Leakage between Control Chamber volume and Hydraulic Chamber volume 
 
The leakage between volumes is due to the pressure differences. As before the parameters can 
be calculated from equation (7) 
 
It is worth mentioning that the annular clearness radius is one of the important parameters. 
This parameter has been studied more closely by making it a variable. This will be a good 
help for running many cases in GT-Fuel and comparing each cases to the original value. 
These results can be seen in the chapter Results and Discussions.

Orifice 
 
 
 
The orifice in the Snubber valve has several functions: 
 
-To damp the needle velocity. 
-To increase the line pressure. 
-To decrease the flow through a line. 
-To increase the fluid velocity in a line.  
 
This object is placed between two flow components (volumes). As a fluid passes through the 
orifice there is a pressure drop from one side to the other (upstream-downstream). The 
pressure drop can be used to calculate the flow rate of the fluid through the orifice, if the 
coefficient of contraction and orifice area are known.  
 
With the momentum equation the flow rate through the orifice can be calculated. Newton 
second law can be written “The Rate of change of momentum of a body is equal to the 
resultant force acting on the body and takes place in the direction of the force.”

All these calculations are made in GT-Fuel. There are some parameters that must be added, 
for example; diameters, forward discharge coefficient, reverse discharge coefficient and 
 
17
thickness. If the diameter and thickness are known and one of the axis parameters are known, 
the other parameter can be calculated from Figure 4.

D is the diameter and L is the thickness [2].  
 
 
 
 
Valve 
 
 
This object is used to model the flow area of a valve, it connects two flow components. The 
valve is defined when high pressure is placed to the valve inlet (determined by the direction of 
the links/arrows), this causes the valve to open. On the other hand the valve will close because 
the valve reacts on the mass motion. From the force balance on the valve, its lift can be 
calculated. This object takes in to consideration the motion of the valve mass and the 
discharge coefficients are specified as the function of the valve lift [2].  
 
Three valves are used in this model: 
 
 
Nozzle Seat  
  
The Nozzle seat is modeled by a valve object (ValveActuLiftAreaCon). This object is placed 
between Injector Body Volume and Sac Volume. It is also connected to needle mass (bottom 
part) by a sensor, gain and actuator (see Figure 5). The sensor connection will sense the 
motion of the needle and then transmit the motion via a gain to the actuator.

In order to calculate the effective flow area as function of the lift, the discharge coefficient is 
taken into account. CFD calculation was used to estimate the discharge coefficient and the 
effective area based on the nozzle seat geometry.  
 
Snubber Valve 
 
The Snubber valve is modeled in the same way as the nozzle seat. It is placed between 
Injector Body Volume on the valve inlet and Control Chamber on the valve outlet. It is 
connected to the Snubber valve mass as mentioned previously. The Snubber valve function is 
to damp the needle oscillation.

The mass flow from the Injector Body volume affects the valve area and causes valve lift. The 
area is zero when the valve displacement is zero and the area is a fraction of mm2 when the 
valve displacement is opened.  
 
Refill Valve 
 
The Refill valve is connected the Injector Body Volume and Hydraulic Chamber Volume. 
This object is connected to the valve mass via sensor, gain and actuator objects. The Refill 
valve function is to provide the Hydraulic Chamber with fuel that is lost during activation due 
to the leakage. This also reduces the wear between the Outer Plunger and the piezo stack.

The mass flow from the Injector Body volume affects the valve area and causes valve lift. 
When the valve displacement is zero the area is zero and when the valve is opened the area is 
a fraction of mm2. 
 
The mechanical flow connection between the volumes and masses 
 
  
The mechanical flow connection is a template which is used in GT-Fuel to connect 
mechanical and flow components. This models the interactions between dynamic mechanical 
systems and flow systems. This object communicates information between the flow and 
mechanical systems in the following way: The pressure applied into a mass creates a force 
and vice versa. For systems with the translational (linear) motion, as in the Piezo-injector, the 
force is applied to the connected mass. Displacement of the mass results in a change in the 
flow chamber volume [2].  
 
The force that will be applied to the mass can be calculated:

(11) 
Where 
F is the force [N] 
P is the pressure [Pa] 
Aeff is the effective area [m2] 
 
Effective area: the area which multiplies the pressure to calculate a force on the mechanical 
component. This area is used to compute a volume change in the attached flow component 
based on the displacement of the attached mechanical component. 
 
The Refill Valve 
 
There are two cases for the Refill Valve; closed and opened. 
 
a. The Refill Valve is closed 
 
When the Refill Valve is closed, see Figure 6, the effective area from the Hydraulic 
Chamber volume (the blue arrows) and Injector Body volume (the red arrows) onto the 
top respectively on the bottom of the valve can be calculated: 
 
I.  Effective area, the force/pressure from Hydraulic Chamber volume on the top of 
the valve (No.1 blue arrows) and a small part of the bottom valve, see Figure 6, 
where the bottom effective area is defined by the dashed black line (No.2).  
 
The effective area No.2 blue is neglected (the area that defined by the contact point x 
between the Refill valve and the Outer Plunger (inner)), see Figure 6. This is 
 
20
because the forces on the specified part of mass in different directions create a 
pressure force where the total force is zero.  
 
 
II. Effective area, the force/pressure from Injector Body volume on the bottom of the 
Refill valve (No.1 red arrows), see Figure 6, will try to move the Refill valve 
upwards, in order to refill the Hydraulic Chamber with fuel that have been lost 
during the compression of Hydraulic Chamber.

Figure 6. The area flow from the Injector-body volume (red arrows) and from the Hydraulic 
Chamber volume (blue arrows) on the Refill Valve when it is closed.  
 
 
 
 
b. The Refill Valve is opened 
 
The Refill valve’s job is to fill the Hydraulic Chamber with fuel because of lost fuel due to 
leakage. When the Refill valve is opened the pressure from the Hydraulic Chamber on the 
effective area of the top of the valve will be the same as the pressure/force from the 
Injector Body on the bottom of the valve.  
 
 
I. The pressure from the Hydraulic Chamber on the effective area of the top of the 
valve. As in the previous section (the valve is closed), the effective area No.1 
blue (blue arrows) can be calculated in the same way. Also area No.2 blue is 
neglected for the same reason as before.  
 
 
II. The pressure from the Injector Body on the bottom effective area of the valve 
will increase when the valve is opened, see Figure 7. This will happen because of 
InjBody

the pressure differences between the Hydraulic Chamber and the Injector Body. 
The pressure in Hydraulic Chamber will decrease when the needle closes (return 
to its initial position). This difference in pressure will help the valve to open and 
fill the Hydraulic Chamber with the fuel that has been lost through leakage.

The Snubber Valve 
 
There are two cases for the Snubber valve, closed and opened. 
 
a. The Snubber valve is closed 
 
When the Snubber valve is closed, see Figure 8, the pressure from the Injector Body affects 
on the top of the valve No.1 blue (blue arrows). The pressure from the Control Chamber 
affects on the corners/curves No.2 (red arrows) and also on the bottom of the valve No.1 (red 
arrows). 
 
I. Effective area, the pressure from the Injector Body onto the top of the Snubber 
valve, see Figure 8, area that market with No.1 blue (blue arrows). This pressure 
will try opening the valve to the maximum.  
 
II. Effective area, the pressure from the Control Chamber volume onto the bottom 
of the Snubber valve No.1 red (red arrows). The pressure on this area will try to 
keep the valve in touch with Upper-Plunger.  
 
The effective area; the area that is surrounded with the dashed rectangle No.2 red 
(red arrows) is neglected. This is because the area influenced by the same pressure 
(Control Chamber volume). The total summation of the pressure which affects this 
area is zero.

When the valve is open, see Figure 9, the pressure from the Injector Body on the top effective 
area of the valve No.1 blue (blue arrows) will increase from the previous case. Also the 
bottom effective area No.1 red (red arrows) which affects by the Control Chamber volume 
will increase. These two effective areas will be the same size/dimension.

Needle 
 
There are two volumes which affect the needle mass; Hydraulic Chamber and Control 
Chamber, see Figure 10.  
 
I. The force from Hydraulic Chamber acts on the needle effective area, see Figure 
10 (red arrows). This force attempts to lift the needle due to high pressure 
created by Outer-Plunger downward movement.  
 
 
 
II. The force from Control Chamber volume acts on the needle effective area, see 
Figure 10 (blue arrows). The force tries to close the needle, after the Upper-
Plunger returns to its initial position the pressure in both chambers drops 
therefore closing the needle.

It is worth mentioning that there is another force which lifts the needle. The force from the 
needle seat has been calculated from CFD simulations. These simulations depend on nozzle 
seat and needle-tip geometry. The discharge coefficients and the effective area are also 
calculated. 
 
The discharge coefficient can be defined as: “In a nozzle or other constriction, the ratio of the 
mass flow rate at the discharge end of the nozzle to that of an ideal nozzle which expands an 
identical working fluid from the same initial conditions to the same exit pressure” [3]. 
 
The discharge coefficient can be determined from the Bernoulli equation and the Continuity 
equation

From the discharge coefficient, effective area and Injector Body pressure the force can be 
calculated. 
 
There are two curves that describe the needle force as function of needle lift. These forces are 
for the low needle lift and high needle lift. The first one is for the low lift which indicates that 
the flow velocity is high and thus the pressure is low. This due to the Bernoulli and Continuity 
equations, the velocity of the fluid will be at its highest and the pressure at it’s lowest in “vena 
contracta”. After the vena contracta the velocity will drop. The pressure recovers to a pressure 
level lower than the pressure before the obstruction and adds a heat loss to the flow.  
 
Outer Plunger 
 
The Outer Plunger is a very important part of the injector, since it produces a pressure 
increase in the Hydraulic Chamber. The increasing pressure acts on the needle area that 
produces the needle opening.  The Outer Plunger is affected by the other forces from the other 
volumes. 
 
I. The force acts on the lower part of Outer Plunger from Hydraulic Chamber. This 
area increases the pressure in the Hydraulic Chamber because of the downward 
motion of the Outer Plunger (caused by Piezo stroke). This is the heart of the 
injector, because the mechanical force converts to a hydraulic pressure acting on 
the needle.  
 
 
II. The forces from the Injector Body and from the Control Chamber volumes act 
on the Outer Plunger are replaced by only one force. This is to simplify the 
model in GT-Fuel. In order to keep the system in balance, a force taken from the 
Injector Body volume acts on the Upper Plunger. This will be discussed in detail 
in the next section. 
 
It is worth mentioning that the effective area for the Outer Plunger from the 
Injector Body and Control Chamber can be calculated.

It was mentioned above that these forces were replaced by only one force, from the Injector 
Body, acting on the Outer Plunger.  
 
Upper Plunger 
 
The Upper Plunger is a link between the Piezo stack and the Outer Plunger. Its job is to 
transmit the Piezo force to the Outer Plunger. There are two volumes which forces the Outer 
Plunger to move upwards or downwards, see Figure 11. These forces are from drain volume 
(red arrows) and from Injector Body volume (blue arrows). Also it is assumed that the spring 
force which supports the Sleeve is too small. Therefore the force from the spring is neglected 
on the Upper Plunger.  
 
I. The force on the upper part effective area (red arrows) of the Upper Plunger 
from drain volume. 
 
 
 
II. The force (from the Injector Body volume) acts on the lower part of the Upper 
Plunger (blue arrows). The pressure (green arrows) applied onto the Upper 
Plunger before the contact point x is neglected. This is because the total force 
will be zero (sum of the forces in all direction on that part).  The remaining 
effective area can be calculated. 
 
As it was mentioned in previously the forces from the Injector Body on the Outer 
Plunger and Upper Plunger will be simplified and replaced as on force from the 
Injector Body onto the lower part of the Upper Plunger.

Piezoelectric Ceramic  
 
Definition and History 
 
 
Ceramic materials and single crystals showing ferroelectric behavior are being used in many 
applications in electronics and optics. A large number of applications of ferroelectric ceramics 
also exploit properties that are an indirect consequence of ferroelectricity, for example 
dielectric, piezoelectric, pyroelectric and electro-optic properties [4]. In the beginning the 
pyroelectric was discovered and by making this discovery, piezoelectricity and ferroelectricity 
(which is one of the piezoelectric characteristic) were discovered and used.    
 
In the mid-18th century the pyroelectric effect was studied by Carolus Linnaeus and Franz 
Aepinus. By pyroelectric effect means those materials that generate an electrical potential in 
response to temperature change. René Just Haüy and Antoine César Beccquerel suggested a 
relationship between electric charge and mechanical stress. 
 
Piezoelectricity was discovered by Pierre and Jacques Curie in 1880. Piezoelectricity is the 
ability of some materials to interact between the mechanical and electrical systems. In other 
words, electricity generated by mechanical pressure on certain crystals (such as quartz or 
Rochelle Salt); alternatively, electrostatic stress produces a change in the linear dimensions of 
the crystal. These materials are of certain crystalline structure including natural crystals of 
Quartz, Rochelle Salt, Tourmaline and manufactured ceramic such as Barium Titanate and 
Lead Zirconate Titanates (PZT) [5 and 6].  
 
The direct piezoelectric effect is when a force is applied to those materials which then 
produce a voltage proportional to the force. The opposite effect is when an electric field is 
applied to those materials. Then the crystals become strained and the change in shape of their 
structure will produce dimensional changes in the material [5 and 6].  
 
In 1921 Ferroelectricity phenomena was discovered. Ferroelectricity called Seignette 
electricity as Seignette or Rochelle Salt (RS) was the first material found to have ferroelectric 
properties. All ferroelectrics are piezoelectric and pyroelectric.  
 
The word Piezo is derived from the Greek piezein which means to squeeze or press. Also the 
word Pyro is derived from Greek which means fire.  
 
 
   
 
29
Piezo ceramics manufacturing and their characteristics  
 
 
Piezoelectric materials are widely used in many applications in both technology and science. 
These materials are ceramic materials and single crystals showing ferroelectric behavior. The 
piezoelectric injector is made of ceramic (Lead Zirconate Titanate (PZT)). The PZT belongs 
to the family of ceramics with perovskite crystal structure, which is made up of small 
tetravalent metal ions such as titanium or zirconium [5 and 6]. 
 
The Piezoelectric ceramic is prepared from a fine powder of component metal oxides (Pb, Zr, 
Ti…etc.) which are mixed in specific quantities and then heated to form a homogeneous 
powder. This powder is then mixed with an organic binder and formed into structural 
elements having the desired shape, for example a discs, plates etc. These elements are fired or 
heated according to a specific temperature and time program, and during this process the 
material obtains a dense crystalline structure [6].  
 
Ferroelectric ceramic (PZT) are represented by the formula ABO3, Perovskite crystalline 
structures where the “A” atom sits at cube corner positions (0, 0, 0) which denotes large 
divalent metal ion such as Pb. “B” atom sits at body center position (½, ½, ½) which denotes 
smaller tetravalent ion such as Ti or Zr, and the oxygen atoms sit at face centered positions 
(½, ½, 0), see Figure 12. 
  
 
Figure 12. Perovskite crystalline structure. 
  
In studying the physical properties of crystals, the orientations of the symmetry elements and 
their positions are important. The crystalline structure of materials can be classified into two 
types: noncentrosymmetric and centrosymmetric. A noncentrosymmetric structure has 
anisotropic characteristics, this means that the properties of the material differ according to 
the direction of the measurement. Piezoelectricity is anisotropic characteristic. Its structure 
provides a net electric dipole moment within the crystal unit cell [7].  
 
All ferroelectric materials have a transition temperature called the Curie point (TC). Above the 
critical temperature, the crystalline structure has a centrosymmetric and below that point has 
the non centrosymmetric.  
 
By applying a strong direct electric field to a poled piezoelectric material which is composed 
of many dipoles randomly oriented (material called isotropic and does not exhibit the 
 
30
piezoelectric effect). The material expands along the axis of the field and contracts 
perpendicular to that axis. The electric dipoles will align in the same direction or parallel to 
the electric field direction. After poling the material has a remnant polarization, see Figure 13.    
 
 
Figure 13. Polarizing a piezoelectric ceramic [6].  
 
Piezoelectric Voltage 
 
 
To identify direction in a piezoelectric element, three axes presented as 1, 2 and 3 or x, y and 
z respectively are used. Since the piezoelectric materials are anisotropic; their electrical, 
mechanical and electromechanical prosperities differ along different directions. Hence the 
three axes are used. The piezoelectric element is not piezoelectric before poling. The direction 
of the poling filed is determined by the 3 direction.  
 
The poling 3 axis is invariably taken along the direction of polarization within the ceramic, 
see Figure 14. The 1 and 2 axes may be randomly located but they must be perpendicular to 
each other.

Figure 14. Direction of poling axis 
 
 
31
The polarization vector P is represented by an arrow pointing from the positive to the negative 
poling electrode. Each constant has two subscripts that indicate the directions of the two 
related quantities, such as stress (force on the ceramic element/surface area of the element) 
and strain (change in the length of element/original length of element) for elasticity.  
 
The Piezoelectric element/stack changes its dimension depending on the direction of the 
polarization and the force that is applied to the piezoelectric which is mechanical 
compression/extension, tension or voltage: 
 
 
 
a) Voltage applied to the piezoelectric element 
 
After the poling process is complete, a voltage lower than the poling voltage will change 
the dimension of the piezoelectric element. A voltage with same polarity as the poling 
voltage extends the ceramic along the poling axis, see Figure 15. This results in changing 
the piezoelectric element dimensions. The element becomes then longer and thinner.   
 
It is worth mentioning that if a voltage with opposite polarity as the poling voltage extends 
the ceramic perpendicular to the poling axis.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 15.  Expansion of the piezoelectric element:  Voltage of the same polarity along 
the axis. 
 
 
By applying a voltage with opposite polarity of the poling axis contracts the ceramic along 
the poling axis, see Figure 16. The element becomes shorter and wider.  
 
Also a voltage with same polarity as the poling voltage contracts the ceramic 
perpendicular to the poling axis.

Figure 16. Contraction of the piezoelectric element: Voltage of the opposite polarity 
along the axis. 
 
 
It is worth mentioning that there is no change of volume during the expansion and 
contraction of the piezoelectric element. The expansion of the length of a plate is 
compensated by an equal contraction of the width or thickness and vise versa. By applying 
voltage to the piezoelectric element this generates a force on a mechanical component.    
 
 
b) Mechanical force applied to a piezoelectric element 
 
After the poling process is complete, a tensile force applied to a piezoelectric element 
along the poling axis will generate expansion of the length and contraction of the width of 
the element, see Figure 17. This generates a voltage with opposite polarity as for the 
poling voltage.  
 
Also if a mechanical expansion (force) applied to piezoelectric element perpendicular to 
the poling axis generates expansion of the length and contraction of the width of the 
element.

A mechanical compression force applied to a piezoelectric ceramic generates a voltage 
with the same polarity as the poling voltage. A mechanical compression parallel to poling 
axis shortens the piezoelectric element, and generates a voltage with same polarity as the 
poling voltage, see Figure 18.  
 
Also, applying a tensile force perpendicular to the poling axis generates a voltage as the

Type of piezoelectric element 
Type of piezoelectric element 
 
 
The rate of piezoelectric element voltage, action and force is quite small. A single element can 
extend to a fraction of a micron. Hence it requires amplification which can be achieved by the 
use of different piezoelectric ceramics, such as Unimorph, Bimorph and Stacks.

Unimorph 
Unimorph 
 
A Unimorph consists of two layers; an active layer and non active layer. The active layer is 
made of piezoelectric element and it bonds to non active layer which is usually made of a non 
piezoelectric material. With this bond the piezo ceramic will deform the entire structure, see 
Figure 19.

Bimorphs 
Bimorphs 
 
A Bimorphs consists of two active layers locked together, so that when a voltage is applied 
these elements deform in opposite direction. If there is a temperature change, one of the layers 
extend, and the other contract. If they are activated electrically, the electric field causes one 
layer to extend and the other one to contract. The displacement per voltage of the Bimorphs is 
greater than for one single disc/plate, typically 10
A Bimorphs consists of two active layers locked together, so that when a voltage is applied 
these elements deform in opposite direction. If there is a temperature change, one of the layers 
extend, and the other contract. If they are activated electrically, the electric field causes one 
layer to extend and the other one to contract. The displacement per voltage of the Bimorphs is 
greater than for one single disc/plate, typically 10 μ  per volt. The Bimorphs are build-in to 
generate large displacement than force, compared to the single plate, see Figure 20. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 20. Voltage applied to Bimorphs piezoelectric.

Actuator Stacks 
 
Stacks are made of several piezoelectric elements mechanically connected to each other in 
series and electrically in parallel. The benefit of this coupling is that it generates a large 
displacement. Each element executes a displacement which adds to the total displacement. In 
other words, the displacement of the whole stack is equal to the sum of individual 
displacements. The displacement of the stack is typically between 5 to 180μm.  
 
Voltages applied to the Stack relative the polarity axis and poling voltage, force the element 
either to expand or contract. The stack is consists of several ceramic elements connected to 
each other electrically in parallel. That means each individual will get the same voltage and 
generate same displacement, see Figure 21.

Sandwich Transducers  
 
The sandwich transducer consists of metal-ceramic-metal. By doing this, it will be able to 
manage resonance below 100 KHz. It is a suitable way of achieving a low ultrasonic 
frequency (20-80 KHz). Ceramic is known to be robust and easy to design. By using metal on 
both sides of the ceramic, cooling is achieved when the ceramic is operated at high power 
levels (see Figure 22).

Limitation of piezoelectric element 
 
The piezoelectric element has some limitations where its characteristic changes from 
polarization to partial or total depolarization. This is because the piezoelectric element 
exceeds the limit for the temperature, voltage or stress.  
 
Temperature limitations 
 
By exposing the piezoelectric ceramic to high temperature, the piezoelectric performance of 
the material decreases, until the permanent depolarization occurs above the Curie temperature. 
Each element has its own Curie point; when the element is heated above that point the 
element lose, its characteristics, see Figure 23. 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 23. Crystal structure of piezo-ceramic [3].  
 
At high temperature, the ageing process accelerates, piezoelectric performance decreases and 
the maximum safe stress level is reduced. 
Voltage Limitations 
 
By applying a strong voltage with the opposite polarity to the original poling voltage to the 
ceramic, it can be depolarized. 
 
 The degree of depolarization is depending on type of the material, the exposure time, 
temperature and other factors. The typical operating limit is between 500-1000 V/mm.  
 
It is worth mentioning that all signal crystals and poled ceramics which show ferroelectric 
behavior are pyroelectric. Pyroelectric ceramics show a spontaneous polarization Ps in a 
certain temperature range. “The spontaneous polarization is given by the value of the dipole 
moment per unit volume or by the value of the charge per unit area on the surface 
perpendicular to the axis of spontaneous polarization, which is usually along a given ceramic 
axis” [4].    
Mechanical stress limitations 
 
The piezoelectric ceramic depolarize by applying a high mechanical stress on the element. 
The limit of the applied stress is dependent on the type of ceramic material and duration of the 
applied stress. 
 
37
Important constant for piezoelectric element 
 
The piezoelectric element for an actuator from the electrical side is much faster than the 
dynamics from the mechanical side. In other words the generated force F is a static function 
of voltage V (ideal conversion from electrical to mechanical energy) minus the spring-damper 
forces k-c. This is the force acting on the piezo mass [2]. 
 
The force can be calculated either by using the physical properties and design geometrical 
details of the piezo element, or by using the test data. Therefore it is good to introduce some 
constants that have a major effect on piezoelectric element, especially by converting the test 
data to the data that will be used in GT-Fuel (This will be introducing in another chapter).

Piezoelectric Element in GT-Fuel 
 
 
 
In this chapter the piezoelectric element will be modeled and coupled to the hydro-mechanic 
system. The components that involve modeling the piezoelectric element are; Force Piezo 
Electric and Signal Generator objects.  
 
Force Piezo Electric 
 
This object is used to convert an electrical energy into a force or to generate an electrical 
voltage when force or displacement is applied. The conversion from mechanical to electrical 
and vice versa is achieved by piezoelectric effect of the material.  
 
In this model, it is assumed that the actuator is composed of stack of a number individual 
layers. Each of these layers has a thickness t. It is assumed that the dynamics of the piezo 
actuator from the electrical side is much faster than the dynamics from the mechanical side. 
That is to say, the generated force is static function of voltage minus the spring-damper force. 
This is the force acting on piezo mass [2].

Signal Generator  
 
 
This template generates an output signal. This may be a constant, parameter or time 
dependent. This object can be used to produce a signal of the current time, angle or cycle at 
each time step.  
 
This template is used to generate volt as a function of time. This function is created in a 
profile transient object. The X values are assumed to be time in milliseconds. Y values are 
assumed to be voltage in Volt. 
 
This template is connected to the piezoelectric force object via an actuator. The actuator is 
usually used to link a multi physic (i.e. flow, mechanical, electrical and etc.).

Verification the Piezoelectric displacement in GT-Fuel with 
Simulink 
 
The piezoelectric element displacement in GT-Fuel is validated with piezoelectric element 
from Simulink. The model is simplified in GT-Fuel. 
 
It is noticeable that the injector model is modified with piezoelectric, Bellow and adapter 
flange. This is because the model in Simulink models only the piezoelectric element, see 
Figure 24. It is worth mentioning that a mass component which represents the piezo mass is 
added to the model. This mass is coupled to the bellow mass via a rigid connection. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 24. Model for piezoelectric injector in Simulink (courtesy of Cummins). 
 
The results from both models are plotted and compared, see Figure 25 and 26. Figure 25 
shows the piezo voltage as a function of time for both programs. The voltage value as an input 
signal for the piezoelectric element is copied from the Simulink data.  
 
 
43
 
Figure 25. Piezo Voltage as function of time for GT-Fuel (blue) Vs. Simulink (red).  
 
After sending the voltage as an input signal to the piezoelectric element in both programs, the 
input parameters for the piezoelectric element, which described in the previous chapter, are 
interpolated. The parameters; such as piezoelectric discharge coefficient, d33, and 
piezoelectric modulus of elasticity, E, are interpolated. This is to get a better output signal 
from the piezoelectric element. Piezo displacement matches the Simulink results. 
 
From the parameters above the results from the GT-Fuel were compared to the Simulink 
results, the comparison was acceptable, see Figure 26.

Results and Discussions  
 
 
Comparing the hydro-mechanical system in GT-Fuel with ACSL  
 
After modeling the hydro-mechanical injection system in GT-Fuel, the simulations were 
compared to the simulations from the Advance Continuous Simulation Language (ACSL) 
program. Both models were modeled without a piezoelectric element. The alternative solution 
for the piezoelectric element was to introduce a displacement. This function is defined as 
piezoelectric displacement (displacement as function of time), see Figure 27.

Figure 27. The input signal, Piezo displacement as function of time, in GT-Fuel, which the 
values are taken from ACSL simulation.  
 
This comparison was made to see if the hydro-mechanical system in GT-Fuel corresponds to 
the simulation from ACSL. 
 
From Figure 28, it is obvious that the correspondence from both simulation programs is good 
for the needle lift. But it seems that the simulation from GT-fuel is faster. Also it is obvious 
that the needle starts to lift and close earlier for the GT-Fuel than ACSL. This also can be seen 
in Hydraulic Chamber pressure, Figure 28 on the right, where the pressure in the first peak 
increases because of piezo stroke. Then the pressure decrease before the ACSL, this is due to 
the needle opening, which attempts to lift the need earlier. Then the needle partially attempts 
to close, this is due to the pressure oscillations in the Injector Body. This also can be seen in 
Hydraulic Chamber pressure, which follows the Injector Body pressure behavior, the peak in 
the middle. The needle partially closing generates volume decreases in the Hydraulic 
Chamber which causes a pressure rise in the Hydraulic Chamber. The needle goes up again 
due to the pressure rise in Hydraulic Chamber. The final moment the needle is closing which 
is caused by Injector Body pressure.

Figure 29 shows the simulation results for injection rate and sac pressure from ACSL (red 
line) and GT-Fuel (blue line). The injection rate curve from the GT-Fuel simulation is higher; 
this due to the injector holes’ diameter. In GT-Fuel the values were taken from the XPI 
injector. XPI injector holes’ diameter differs from the piezo injector.  The oscillation in the 
injection rate depend on the sac pressure, this is obvious from Figure 29, the figure on the 
right side, where the sac pressure shows the same oscillation. This oscillation may be due to 
the numerical solver in the program.

(blue line) and ACSL (red line). 
 
Figure 30 shows the Upper Plunger motion. The simulation results from GT-Fuel and ACSL 
have roughly the same profile shape. The GT-Fuel simulation (blue lines) results generate 
displacement, which is the same as for the piezoelectric motion. As it mentioned in a previous 
chapter the Upper Plunger mass is divided into two masses (Top and Bottom masses).  
 
Figure 30 shows the deflection between the top and bottom mass for the Upper Plunger in 
GT-Fuel in comparison with the ACSL. Also it is noticeable that the Upper Plunger top for 
GT-Fuel and ACSL do not overlap the same as for the bottom part. This is due to the stiffness 
and damper coefficients that are used between these parts. According to the stiffness 
 
46
coefficient k equation (2) can be concluded that the stiffness coefficient for each mass 
depends on the mass elastics modulus, the mass area and the length of the mass element.  
 
 
 
Figure 30. Upper Plunger displacement from ACSL (red lines) and GT-Fuel (blue lines).  
 
 
This can be clarified in greater detail. In ACSL the injector parts, such as Upper Plunger, 
Outer Plunger are not divided to sub-masses. In ACSL for instance the Upper Plunger mass 
was connected from both sides with spring and damper, see Figure 31.

The same behavior can be seen in the Outer Plunger motion, see Figure 32. The results from 
ACSL (red lines, for Outer Plunger top and Outer Plunger bottom) do not exactly correspond 
to the results from GT-Fuel. The deflection between the Outer Plunger top and bottom mass 
in GT-Fuel are not corresponding in the same as in ACSL. As mentioned previously, this is 
due to the differences in damper and stiffness coefficients in both systems.

Figure 32. Outer Plunger displacement from ACSL (red lines) and GT-Fuel (blue lines). 
 
 
Figure 33 shows the simulation results from simulation programs, GT-Fuel (blue line) and 
ACSL (red line), for the Hydraulic Chamber pressure. The hydraulic pressure takes time to 
reach the initial value in GT-Fuel. This is due partially to the stabilizing time for the hydro-
mechanical system to reach its equilibrium position and partially because of the systems 
damper and stiffness coefficients.  
 
 The Outer Plunger downward movement increases with the pressure in the Hydraulic 
Chamber, which is represented in the first peak (see Figure 33). At the highest point on the 
first peak the needle attempts to lift. As explained previously the needle lift occurs earlier in 
GT-Fuel. Then the pressure drops in Hydraulic Chamber due to the upward needle movement, 
which causes an increasing in Hydraulic Chamber volume. The second peak is due to the 
needle attempting to close due to the pressure oscillation in the Control Chamber which 
follows the Injector Body pressure behavior. The hydraulic pressure rises quickly. The 
pressure drops and causes the needle to close.    
 
From Figure 33, it can be seen that the result from ACSL simulation has a peak at the end of 
the trace. This is because at that moment the Refill valve opens and causes an increase in 
pressure.

Figure 33. Simulation results for Hydraulic Chamber pressure on the left and Hydraulic 
Chamber volume on the right from GT-Fuel (blue line) and ACSL (red line).   
 
The correspondence of the simulation results for the Control Chamber pressure is quite 
acceptable, see Figure 34. The GT-Fuel pressure results are greater than the ACSL pressure 
results. This is maybe due to the damper and stiffness coefficients that are used in GT-Fuel.   
 
As the needle lifts up the Control Chamber decreases in volume, this causes a pressure rise in 
the Control Chamber. Pressure increases in the Control Chamber attempt to close the needle, 
see Figure 34, middle peak on the Control Chamber pressure. This is due to the Control 
Chamber pressure following the Injector Body pressure. The last dip on the pressure curve is 
due to the needle closing. The Control Chamber volume increase to the initial value, see 
Figure 34 to the right. The last dip for the GT-Fuel simulation are greater than for the ACSL, 
this may due to the Refill valve opening for the ACSL.

simulation results were satisfactory.

Figure 35. Simulation results for Injector Body pressure from GT-Fuel (blue line) and ACSL 
(red line). 
 
A test was made to insure that these differences in the simulations were due to the dampers 
and stiffness coefficients values, which were not modified in the same way in these systems. 
In other words, the differences in vertical and longitudinal displacements between the 
simulations are due to the stiffness and damper. Therefore some adjustment to the stiffness 
and damping coefficients were made, the results can be seen in Figure 36. It is obvious, that 
the needle starts to lift in GT-Fuel at the same time as for the ACSL. Also it is worth 
mentioning that the Refill valve opens in GT-Fuel too. This concludes that model in GT-Fuel 
is modeled correctly but the values of stiffness and dampers coefficients are not correct.

Conclusion 
 
 
The simulation model of the hydro-mechanical system, in GT-Fuel corresponds well to the 
simulation model from ACSL. Also the simulation model, piezoelectric stack, in GT-Fuel 
corresponds to the Simulink simulation, with regards to the piezoelectric stack displacement, 
force and voltage.  
 
The difficulties lied in modeling the forces that acted on the needle and attempts to lift it up 
from the sac with different Injector Body pressures. The force values around the cup and

The piezoelectric element in GT-Fuel is simple and does not cover all the areas, such as 
capacitance, resistor voltage source...etc. Therefore the needle displacement was higher than it 
should be. The electrical circuits of the piezoelectric element are not solved in the best way in 
piezoelectric element template in GT-Fuel. There are some functions that could be used in 
GT-Fuel such as input signals of voltage, resistor…etc. in order to model the piezoelectric 
element. Due to the lack of the time, this was not modeled.

It is worth mentioning that some efforts have been made to connect the Simulink model to the 
GT-Fuel model. The Simulink model modeled the piezoelectric stack. This was omitted, 
because it will take time to understand the function and the model in Simulink.

The simulation results for GT-Fuel and ACSL corresponded roughly to each other. The 
results show that there are differences in longitudinal and vertical deformations. This can due 
to the how the injector models are modeled in these simulation programs, which can due to 
incorrect input values of stiffness and damper coefficients in GT-Fuel. The solution for this 
problem is to remodel the injector in GT-Fuel as in ACSL. This means, that the stiffness 
coefficients will be recalculated (in series) as the values for the dampers.

To clarify the differences we can take the figure that was introduced previously in Chapter 
Results and Discussions, see Figure 37. As we see, the figure on the left side, ACSL model, 
the mass is able to move with out any restriction depending on the stored force in the springs 
and dampers. Where in the right figure, GT-Fuel model, the bottom mass displacement 
depends on the top mass, spring and dampers. In other word, the out deformation (deflection), 
uout, in GT-Fuel is affected by the deflection that occurs in the first mass and the stored force 
in spring and damper.

As it mentioned earlier, the damping coefficients were not modified in the same way for both 
systems. In order to correlate this difference, the damping coefficient can be calculated 
according to the following equation: 
 
 
 
m
k
c
⋅
⋅
⋅
=
ξ

Where 
 
c is the damping coefficient [Ns/m] 
 
ξ is the critical damping ratio 
 
k is the stiffness coefficient [N/m] 
 
m is the mass [kg] 
 
Finally, conversion of some parameters to variables had a major influence on the injector 
performance. Increasing the clearance diameter had a major influence on the needle lift, 
which causes the needle to close earlier. Decreasing the Orifice diameter affects needle 
profile. In other words the needle closes slower than previous cases, this was due to the mass 
flow through orifice connection, where it takes time to refill the Control Chamber. Increasing 
the Injector Body volume did not have that much influence on the needle displacement, but 
resulted in a square needle lift profile.
