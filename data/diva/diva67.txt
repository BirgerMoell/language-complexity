Premature failure of buildings due to moisture is an issue of both public and 
commercial dimensions. Most of today's building damages can be linked to moisture. 
Moisture also plays a significant role in health problems related to indoor climate. 
Building physics is despite this rarely discussed seriously during the building design 
phase. Possible reasons include unclear responsibilities; short-term economic focus; a 
fragmentized building process; and lack of proper training and competence. This 
report describes a method for managing moisture issues in the early stages of the 
building process. The method aims to provide the client and other key stakeholders 
with knowledge of the physical performance of various technical solutions prior to 
making strategic decisions. A case study demonstrates that a focus on risk-driven 
scenarios can deliver several positive results. Other conclusions are that the design 
phase generally has to be extended and that building physics should play a major role 
in the design phase. The number of experts responsible for different parts of the 
design should, however, be kept to a minimum.
