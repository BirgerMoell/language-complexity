Sammanfattning 
Den senaste finanskrisen har visat att det finns ett behov av ökad övervakning av aktörerna på den 
finansiella marknaden. Ett sätt att förbättra övervakningen är genom att öka förståelsen för 
företagens affärsmodeller. Syftet med detta examensarbete är att hitta likheter i affärsmodellerna hos 
svenska kreditinstitut och hos svenska filialer av utländska banker. Mer specifikt syftar denna studie 
till att hitta grupper av företag, i denna rapport kallat kluster, med liknande affärsmodell och till att 
identifiera existerande affärsmodeller på den svenska bankmarknaden. Informationen som användes 
i studien är från årsredovisningar som rapporterades till Finansinspektionen för åren 2000, 2005, 
2010 och 2013. 
 
För att möjliggöra en jämförelse mellan olika aktörers data har kvoter skapats utifrån deras balans- 
och resultaträkningar. För att reducera mängden data och för att få ett fåtal okorrelerade variabler 
användes principalkomponentanalys. Metoden som användes för att hitta klustren är en hierarkisk 
agglomerativ metod kallad Wards metod. Antalet kluster bestämdes genom att använda Calinski-
Harabasz-index. Bootstrapping användes för att testa stabiliteten hos de identifierade klustren. 
  
Denna studie visar att mönster existerar på den svenska bankmarknaden och att det är möjligt att 
hitta kluster av företag med liknande affärsmodell. Svenska filialer av utländska banker och svenska 
kreditinstitut har studerats separat. För svenska kreditinstitut hittades sex kluster och för att beskriva 
affärsmodellerna kallas de: Universalbanker, Sparbanker, Leasingföretag, Icke inlåningsfinansierade 
kreditinstitut, Servicefokuserade kreditinstitut och Övriga kreditinstitut. De mest stabila klustren, det vill säga 
de med högst likhet, är Sparbanker och Leasingföretag. Klustret med lägst likhet är Universalbanker och 
detta bör ses som ett mönster i använd data snarare än ett kluster. För de svenska filialerna av 
utländska banker hittades tre kluster och dessa kallas: Banker, Servicefokuserade kreditinstitut och Övriga 
kreditinstitut. Dessa kluster är stabila.

Abstract 
The recent financial crisis has emphasized the need for improved supervision of the actors on the 
financial market. One way to improve supervision is through better understanding of business 
models. The aim with this thesis is to find similarities in business models for Swedish credit 
institutions and for Swedish branches of foreign banks. More specific this study aims to find groups 
of companies, in this paper called clusters, with similar business models and identify existing 
business models in the banking market. The data used in this study are financial statements reported 
to the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority for the years 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2013.  
 
In order to compare the companies’ data, ratios from the income statements and balance sheets 
have been created. To reduce the amount of data and arrive at a smaller set of uncorrelated 
variables, principal component analysis was used. The method used for finding the clusters was a 
hierarchical agglomerative clustering method called Ward’s method. The number of clusters was 
determined using Calinski-Harabasz index. Bootstrapping was used in order to test cluster stability. 
  
This study shows that patterns in the Swedish banking sector exist and that it is possible to find 
clusters of companies with similar business models. Swedish branches of foreign banks have been 
treated separately from Swedish credit institutions. For Swedish credit institutions a division into six 
clusters was found to be most suitable and in order to describe the business model the clusters are 
named: Universal banks, Savings banks, Leasing companies, Non-deposit funded credit institutions, Service-focused 
credit institutions and Other credit institutions. The most stable clusters, that are the clusters with highest 
similarity, are Savings banks and Leasing companies. The cluster with lowest stability is Universal banks 
and it could be considered as a pattern in the data rather than a cluster. For Swedish branches of 
foreign banks, three clusters were found to be most suitable and the clusters are named: Banks, 
Service-focused credit institutions and Other credit institutions. These clusters are stable.

 Introduction
This section gives an introduction to the topic and provides an understanding of the problem 
addressed in the thesis. The purpose is then described, research questions are given, the delimitation 
and academic contribution is presented and finally the disposition of the thesis is given. 1.1
 Background
The companies in the financial sector offer services which are important for economic growth and 
for a working economy. Difficulties for financial companies can affect the whole economy and this 
can lead to difficulties for non-financial companies to get access to credit and thereby limit their 
possibility to invest and expand (Sveriges Riksbank, 2015). A great financial crisis occurred 2007-
2008 and in order to prevent future financial crises, monitoring of credit institutions has been 
intensified and requirements have been raised. Credit institutions are companies that have the right 
to accept deposits from the public and offer transfer of payments. Credit institutions consist of 
banks and credit market companies. Credit institutions in Sweden are supervised by 
Finansinspektionen, which is the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA). The role of the 
Swedish FSA is to supervise financial markets and make sure that companies on this market follow 
appropriate rules, in order to ensure financial stability. At the moment the Swedish FSA supervises 
more than 200 Swedish credit institutions (Finansinspektionen, 2016a). 
Why banks exist can be explained by the economic functions they perform. One economic function 
offered by banks is to connect borrowers and lenders. Another economic function of banks is 
financial asset transformation, which means that individual lenders may offer different asset 
quantities than the borrowers require. Banks also perform the function of screening potential 
borrowers and monitoring borrowers over the period they borrow. Another important function is 
offering efficient ways of transferring funds (Cavelaars & Passenier, 2012). Banks may become 
bankrupt due to the nature of the business offered and there are two main reasons for this to 
happen: insolvency and/or liquidity crisis. Both are often caused by counterparty risks. If asset 
values decline sharply the capital of a bank can rapidly be reduced or even be wiped out. Even the 
risk of this happening can reduce counterparties’ willingness to lend, which is very problematic in 
situations where banks need cash or liquid assets to meet their commitments. In situations where 
banks have bad assets, for example non-performing loans on their balance sheet, it takes time to 
discover the true value of them and they may take many years to mature. Asset values that have 
declined below previously reported values are written down and can therefore lead to insolvency 
(Blundell-Wignall, et al., 2014).

A central part of bank supervision is to reduce financial system vulnerability and limit the 
companies’ risk taking. In order to prevent bank failures, regulatory frameworks and requirements 
are put in place. To ensure that financial activities are handled with proper care and good risk 
management, the Swedish FSA has put up minimum requirements. Credit institutions need to have 
sufficient capital to cover both known risks and risks that are not fully known. Sufficient liquidity is 
needed in order to cover short-term payment commitments (Finansinspektionen, 2016b). 
Between 2013 and 2019 a new type of regulatory framework called Basel III is gradually 
implemented. It was designed to improve the ability of banks to absorb losses and decrease the 
probability for new crises. The European Union has decided to implement Basel III regulations in 
its member states and the rules should govern all banks and credit market companies (European 
Union, 2013). 
The European Banking Authority has prepared guidelines in order to achieve common procedures 
and methodologies for supervision of banks. The framework for Supervisory Review and Evaluation 
Process is based on four pillars and one is business model analysis (European Banking Authority, 
2014). The Swedish FSA also points out that there is a need to understand companies’ business 
models in order to prioritize the supervision (Finansinspektionen, 2016b). Analyzing bank business 
models is the focus of this thesis and more specifically it investigates whether it is possible to divide 
Swedish credit institutions into clusters with similar business models. 1.2
 Problem Definition
Currently there are more than 200 credit institutions in Sweden and it is time consuming for the 
Swedish FSA to monitor them individually. For the Swedish FSA, it is relevant to examine whether 
companies have similar business models. If they do it opens up a possibility to simplify the 
supervision, since it might be possible to supervise them in clusters rather than individually. By 
studying groups of companies, characteristics over time can be found. If a company deviates from 
previous year’s group characteristics it can act as an indication for the Swedish FSA to investigate 
whether there has been significant changes in the operations of the company. 1.3
 Purpose
 
The purpose of this study is to find similarities in business models for Swedish credit institutions 
and for Swedish branches of foreign bank. This study aims at finding clusters of companies with 
similar business models and to identify the existing business models for credit institutions. It also 
aims at investigating whether companies belong to the same category over time or if they move 
between clusters.

 ResearchQuestions
This thesis aims at answering two main questions where one of them can be divided into two sub-
questions. The research questions are: 
 How should Swedish credit institutions be categorized? 
 
This question can be divided into the following sub-questions: 
o How many categories are suitable? 
o Which are the distinct features for each category, in terms of how companies in each 
category generate their income and how their balance sheets are built up? 
 
 Do Swedish credit institutions change categories over time? 1.5
 Delimitations
This study classifies Swedish credit institutions and Swedish branches of foreign banks. Foreign 
branches of Swedish banks are not studied separately, since they are included in the Swedish banking 
groups. Only active companies were considered for this study, in other words, companies with 
discontinued operations were not included. This study uses data for the years 2000, 2005, 2010 and 
2013. 1.6
 Academic Contribution
As opposed to earlier studies, this study includes credit market companies and all small banks, while 
earlier studies have mainly focused on large banks. The inclusion of credit market companies 
differentiates this study from earlier studies, although it is important to bear in mind that some of 
these companies could have been classified as banks in other jurisdictions. No previous study has, to 
our knowledge, categorized Swedish credit institutions and Swedish branches of foreign banks, 
which our study aims to do. In previous studies the authors have selected ratios they found useful 
for characterizing business models. Our ambition is to use another method where ratios do not need 
to be selected manually. 1.7
 Disposition
The report is structured as follows. Chapter 2 describes the institutional background. Chapter 3 
describes a literature review within this area and how this study differs from previous studies. 
Chapter 4 describes the methodology. Chapter 5 presents the data and describes it by using 
boxplots. Chapter 6 presents the identified clusters both for Swedish credit institutions and for 
Swedish branches of foreign banks. Chapter 7 answers the research questions and discusses the 
results. Chapter 8 concludes the study and presents suggestions for future research.

 Institutional Background
This section describes the institutional background of this study. Initially, the Swedish credit 
institution market is described and afterwards an introduction to supervision of Swedish credit 
institutions is given. 2.1
 Swedish Banks
At the moment the Swedish FSA supervise 165 Swedish banks and 520 foreign banks with 
operation in Sweden (Finansinspektionen, 2016a). These banks can be divided into groups according 
to the laws the companies are obliged to follow and the groups are described below. 2.1.1 Commercial Banks
At the moment there are 39 banking companies (limited liability companies) (Finansinspektionen, 
2016a). Below follows a description of the three types these companies can be divided into. The FourLargest Banks
The Swedish bank market is dominated by four large banks and these are: Skandinaviska Enskilda 
Banken AB, Nordea Bank AB, Swedbank AB and Svenska Handelsbanken AB. These banks offer a 
wide range of services and can be considered as universal banks (Svenska Bankföreningen, 2016). In 
Sweden, these four banks had 74 % of total bank assets in 2014. Among the four large banks, 
Nordea can be differentiated by having a larger share of lending to foreign public, approximately ¾ 
of their public lending is to foreign public (Sveriges Riksbank, 2015). 
The parent companies for the four large banks own several companies where different segments of 
the business are conducted. For example the mortgage operation of Svenska Handelsbanken AB is 
in the company Stadshypotek AB and the leasing business is in Handelsbanken Finans AB. Svenska 
Handelsbanken AB also has separate companies for insurance and mutual funds. Stadshypotek AB 
and Handelsbanken Finans AB are credit market companies, which mean that they are supervised 
separately. Former Savings Banks
Due to the financial crisis in Sweden in the early 1990s, it became possible to restructure savings 
banks into banking companies. In 1992, 11 restructured savings banks merged and formed 
Sparbanken Sverige, which was listed on the Swedish stock exchange in 1995. In 1997 Sparbanken 
Sverige merged with Föreningssparbanken and 2006 the name was changed to Swedbank AB. When 
a savings bank is restructured into a banking company, an ownership foundation is created 
 
5 
 
(Sparbanksakademin, 2016). A restructured savings bank can be partly or fully owned by the 
ownership foundation (Sparbankernas Riksförbund, 2013). At the moment there are 13 restructured 
savings banks, some of these are partly owned by Swedbank AB. Other Banks
Several banks specialized in different areas exist on the Swedish banking market. Many of these can 
be considered as niche banks, which mean that they are not offering all the services that are offered 
by some of the larger banks. These banks are mainly concentrated in the private customer market 
and they often do not operate with physical branch offices. Instead the services are offered online or 
by telephone (Svenska Bankföreningen, 2016). One example is Avanza, an online stock broker. 2.1.2 Savings Banks
At the moment there are 47 savings banks in Sweden (Finansinspektionen, 2016a). Savings banks 
operate in a local market and are in most cases small. A savings bank has no shareholders and 
therefore do not pay any dividends. Instead, the profit is kept in the bank (Sveriges Riksbank, 2015), 
but usually a part of the profit is donated to local associations, for example sports clubs 
(Sparbankernas Riksförbund, 2013). The number of savings banks has decreased over time, mostly 
due to mergers and conversion into banking companies. For example: Lönneberga sparbank merged 
with Lönneberga-Tuna-Vena sparbank in 2008 and Sparbanken Alingsås, Sparbanken Eken and 
Sparbanken Skaraborg converted to banking companies. 2.1.3 Members Banks
A members bank is an economic association offering bank services to its members. Only two 
companies are classified as members banks in Sweden: JAK Medlemsbank and Ekobanken 
medlemsbank (Finansinspektionen, 2016a). Members banks have a market share of less than 0.1 % 
in Sweden. 2.1.4 Foreign Branches of Swedish Chartered Banks
At the moment the Swedish FSA supervise 77 foreign branches of Swedish chartered banks 
(Finansinspektionen, 2016a). This group consists of foreign branches of Swedish banking 
companies, usually operating in European countries and especially in the Nordic countries. The 
majority of foreign branches of Swedish chartered banks belong to the four largest Swedish banks. 2.1.5 Foreign Banks with Operation in Sweden
The presence of foreign banks in Sweden is significant and foreign banks operate in Sweden as 
branches. A branch is not a separate legal entity; instead it is a part of the foreign company. 
Branches do not have any share capital, the assets and liabilities belong to the foreign company. 
However, a branch must have its own accounting, which is separated from the foreign company 
(Bolagsverket, 2015). At the moment, there are 28 foreign management companies (branches) 
(Finansinspektionen, 2016a). The largest one is Danske Bank, which is the fifth largest bank in 
 
6 
 
Sweden in terms of total assets (Sveriges Riksbank, 2015). Danske Bank has had a great presence in 
Sweden since its acquisition of the Swedish bank Östgöta Enskilda Bank in 1997. 2.1.6 Market Share of the Ten Largest Banks
The Swedish banking market is characterized by a few large banks and a large number of small 
banks. Table 1 shows total assets of the ten largest banks in 2014. The four largest banks, in terms 
of total assets are Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB, Nordea Bank AB, Swedbank AB and Svenska 
Handelsbanken AB. In addition to the four largest banks there are a number of other large banks: 
Danske Bank A/S, SBAB Bank AB, Länsförsäkringar Bank Aktiebolag, DNB Bank ASA, 
Landshypotek Bank Aktiebolag and Skandiabanken Aktiebolag (Sveriges Riksbank, 2015). Danske 
Bank A/S and DNB Bank ASA are foreign branches, while the others are banking companies 
(Finansinspektionen, 2016a).

Table 1 Total assets for the ten largest banks in 2014 (Sveriges Riksbank, 2015) 
 
The sum of total assets for the ten largest banks in Sweden in 2014 was 6,803 billion SEK and the 
sum of total assets for all banks in Sweden was 7,371 billion SEK (Sveriges Riksbank, 2015). This 
illustrates that the Swedish banking market is dominated by a few large banks and the majority of 
banks have very small market shares. 2.1.7 Number of Banks overTime
The number of banks supervised by the Swedish FSA has changed over time which can be seen in 
Table 2. The total number of Swedish banks has increased from 137 in 2000 to 165 in 2016. The 
number of banking companies has increased from 22 to 39 and the number of foreign branches of 
Swedish chartered banks has increased from 29 to 77. The number of members banks has been 
constant over the period and the number of savings banks has decreased from 84 to 47. During the 
same period the number of foreign management companies has increased from 19 to 28 
(Finansinspektionen, 2016a; Finansinspektionen, 2016c).

 Swedish Credit MarketCompanies
A credit market company is a limited liability company authorized to conduct financing (SFS 
2004:297). A credit market company can both engage in borrowing and lending. Historically, banks 
had a monopoly in deposits, but since July 2004 credit market companies are allowed to offer credit 
and receive deposits (Sveriges Riksbank, 2015). At the moment the Swedish FSA supervises 78 
credit market companies and 32 foreign credit market companies (Finansinspektionen, 2016a). 
These companies can be divided into groups according to the laws applicable to the companies. The 
groups are described below. 2.2.1 Credit Market Companies
At the moment the Swedish FSA supervises 36 credit market companies (Finansinspektionen, 
2016a). A wide range of services are offered by credit market companies and typically these 
companies are focused on offering credit in a particular area, for example mortgages. Sveriges 
Riksbank (2015) divides the credit market companies into two groups: mortgage institutions and 
other credit institutions. Mortgage institutions mainly finance home loans and at present there are 
six companies. The category other credit market companies consists of finance companies and 
corporate- and municipality-financing institutions. The majority of other credit market companies 
are finance companies and they usually focus on different types of funding, for example leasing or 
factoring (Sveriges Riksbank, 2015).2.2.2 Foreign Branches of Swedish Loan Companies
At present, 42 foreign branches of Swedish loan companies are supervised by the Swedish FSA 
(Finansinspektionen, 2016a). This group consists of foreign branches of credit market companies 
which usually operate in European countries and especially in the Nordic countries.2.2.3 Foreign Credit Market Companies
In order to do business in Sweden, foreign credit market companies need permission from the 
Swedish FSA. At the moment there are two Swedish branches of foreign credit market companies 
(Finansinspektionen, 2016a).

 2.2.4 The Largest Credit Market Companies
In 2014, total assets of all credit market companies was 3,598 billion SEK of which mortgage 
institutions accounted for 2,693 billion SEK. This can be compared to total assets for all banks, 
branches included, that was 7,371 billion SEK at the same time (Sveriges Riksbank, 2015). It is 
important to remember that most of the larger credit market companies are owned by banks. Table 
3 describes total assets of the Swedish mortgage institutions in 2014.

Table 3 and Table 4 show that the group of credit market companies is dominated by a few large 
companies and the largest companies are mortgage lenders. A large number of smaller credit market 
companies are also operating in the market.2.2.5 Number of Credit market Companies over Time
The number of credit market companies supervised by the Swedish FSA has changed over time 
which is shown in Table 5. The total number of Swedish credit market companies has decreased 
from 105 in 2000 to 78 in 2013. The number of foreign branches of Swedish loan companies has 
increased from 26 to 42 and the number of credit market companies has decreased from 79 to 36.

During 2005 and 2010 the Swedish FSA supervised one credit market association. During the same 
period the number of foreign credit market companies has increased from 0 to 2 
(Finansinspektionen, 2016a; Finansinspektionen, 2016c).

 How Banks Generate their Revenue
 
Nowadays banks offer more services than just lending and borrowing. As can be seen in Table 6, the 
main sources of income are interest income, commission income and dividends from group 
companies. Below the table are two main sources of income, net interest income and net 
commission income, explained further. Some examples of what is included in other operating 
income is presented afterwards.

Table 6 Income for Swedish banks 2015 (Statistiska Centralbyrån, 2016) 2.3.1 Net Interest Income
Net interest income is the difference between interest income and interest expense. Net interest 
income was the greatest source of income for Swedish banks in 2015. The main part of interest 
income is derived from loans to the public. One example of how interest income and expeneses are 
distributed for one of the largest banks can be found in Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB’s annual 
report for 2015 (Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, 2016). Approximately 70 % of interest income was 
                                                 
ii 2000-2013 as 1st January. 2016 as May 2016

derived from loans to the public with an average interest rate of 2.0 %. Approximately 25 % of the 
interest expense was paid to public depositors with an average interest rate of 0.4 %. Around ⅔ of 
the interest expense was paid on issued debt securities with an average interest rate of 1.6 %. For 
savings banks the great majority of interest income comes from loans to the public and almost the 
whole interest expense is paid to deposits from the public. One example can be found in the annual 
report for Sörmlands Sparbank in 2015, which is one of the largest savings banks in Sweden 
(Sörmlands Sparbank, 2016). In this case 97 % of the interest income was from loans to the public 
and 84 % of the interest expense was paid to deposits from the public. 2.3.2 Net Commission Income
Net commission income is the difference between income and expense for fee-based services. Banks 
offer a wide range of fee-based services. For a large bank, significant commission generating 
activities are for example asset management, credit cards, payment proccessing and brokerage. One 
example of how commission acitivities are classified by a large bank can be found in Nordea’s 
annual report for 2015. In this report commission activities are classified as either savings related 
commission, payment commission, lending related commission and other commission income 
(Nordea, 2016). Some companies also offer services such as insurance or corporate finance. 2.3.3 Other Operating Income
Acitvities that do not fit into the other categories are categorized as other operating income. 
Examples of what could be included in other operating income are divestment of shares, 
remunerations from group undertakings, IT services, profit from sale of properties and income from 
real estate operations. 2.4
 Supervision of Swedish Credit Institutions 
The Swedish FSA’s classification of banks is made according to the applicable laws. All Swedish 
banks and credit market companies are under the rule of law The Banking and Finance Business Act 
(SFS 2004:297). This law describes general conditions the companies have to follow. There are 
special laws for different types of banks. Savings banks have to follow the Savings Banks Act (SFS 
1987:619). Members banks have to follow the Members Banks Act (SFS 1995:1570). Foreign banks 
with Swedish branches have to follow the Foreign Branch Offices Act (SFS 1992:160). The Swedish 
FSA supervises approximately 2,000 financial companies and 900 foreign financial companies with 
operations in Sweden (Finansinspektionen, 2016a). 
The Swedish government has ordered the Swedish FSA to be responsible for supervision and 
licensing for financial markets and financial companies. In addition to the government’s decree 
regarding supervision, Swedish laws, for example The Banking and Finance Business Act (SFS 
2004:297) and Special Supervision of Credit Institutions and Investment Firms Act (SFS 2014:968), 
control the Swedish FSA’s operations. The special Supervision of Credit Institutions and Investment 
Firms Act states that the Swedish FSA is responsible for checking that companies follow prudential 
 
11 
 
regulation, which is a regulation stating that companies need to hold adequate capital 
(Finansinspektionen, 2016b). 
All companies, independent of their size, have to follow the basic requirements and the supervision 
is, in principle, the same. Supervised companies have to report financial data to the Swedish FSA 
which is used to analyze key performance indicators as well as risk indicators. In order to prioritize 
supervision an understanding of the business models is required. Knowledge about how risks 
emerge and how revenue is generated can be used to prioritize the supervision. The four largest 
banks are more supervised than other companies, not only because they are significantly larger than 
all other financial companies but also because they have a high interconnection with the Swedish 
financial system (Finansinspektionen, 2016b).

 Literature Review
This section first describes the business model concept in general and then how it can be applied on 
banks. A literature review regarding clustering of banks is then presented according to the purpose 
of the study. 3.1
 Business Models
 
 
Figure 1 Components of a business model (Shafer, et al., 2005) 
As can be seen from the previous chapter, there are significant differences between Swedish credit 
institutions. Both in terms of size and what they are specialized in. How a company conducts its 
business can be characterized by its business model. However, there is no generally accepted 
definition of what a business model is. One definition is that it is a representation of a company’s 
strategic choices and underlying core logic (Shafer, et al., 2005). Shafer et al. (2005) classify the 
components of a business model into four distinct categories: strategic choices, the value network, 
creating value and capturing value. The strategic choices consider for example which markets to 
target and which products to offer. Value network can be described as the context within which a 
firm competes and solve problems for customers (Christensen & Rosenbloom, 1995). Creating value 
and capturing value consider two important aspects of companies needs to be viable over a longer 
time period (Shafer, et al., 2005). The components are general and apply to all types of companies. 
When considering banks specifically, Cavelaars and Passenier (2012) argue that a description of a 
bank’s business model needs to, at least, describe what the bank offers (in terms of products and 
services), how it distributes what it offers, how it reaches its potential customers, how it generates 
profit and discuss if the profits are sustainable. 
 
13 
 
Mergaerts and Vander Vennet (2016) found the European banking sector to be characterized by a 
continuum rather than a discrete set of business models. In contrast, this thesis aims to find clusters 
that are as homogenous as possible, as done in earlier studies such as Ayadi et al. (2011), Ayadi and 
De Groen (2014) and Roengpitya et al. (2014). According to Mergaerts and Vander Vennet (2016) 
the business model of a bank could be described by a set of variables that captures the asset, liability, 
and capital and income structure. When considering other relevant variables such as distribution 
channels and type of products offered, the authors believe that this information should be reflected 
in the balance sheets and income statements for the companies. 3.2
 Strategic Groups
The concept of strategic groups, made popular by Porter (1980), has been applied on banks in order 
to determine strategic groups within the banking sector. Strategic groups are often defined as groups 
of companies within the same industry who makes similar decisions in key areas. The concept of 
strategic groups was created to explain intra-industry performance differences. In a study by Amel 
and Rhoades (1988) of 16 selected bank markets, it was found that approximately six different 
strategic groups exist in banking and the strategy choices were similar across the studied markets. 
The obtained results were stable over time. In contrast, José Más Ruíz (1999) studied the Spanish 
banking market and found significant changes in the number and strategies of the identified strategic 
groups over time. Koller (2001) applied the strategic group concept in a study of the Austrian 
banking market during 1995-2000. One finding from this study was that all banks do not belong to 
strategic groups. 3.3
 Business Models and Bank Stability
The purpose of some studies, for example Köhler (2015), is to analyze the impact of business 
models on bank stability. Banks from 15 EU countries were studied and a large number of unlisted 
banks were included. Most of the unlisted banks were savings and cooperative banks and ⅔ of the 
banks in the study belonged to these categories. Four different types of business models were 
identified: savings, cooperative, commercial and investment banks. One of the findings was that 
banks will be more profitable and stable if they increase their share of non-interest income. Halaj 
and Zochowski (2009) used cluster analysis to identify strategic groups in the Polish bank sector in 
order to see how they differ in performance. By doing so the authors attempted to get a better ex 
ante assessment of the loss absorption capabilities for banks, which is important in the analysis of 
bank sector stability. 3.4
 Business Models and Bank Risk
Altunbas et al. (2011) investigated the connection between bank risk variables and other variables 
characterizing banks. In this study the impact of business models on bank risk was also investigated 
and the authors found the relationship to be highly non-linear. Several relationships were found, for 
example, market funding increase the distress probability for the riskiest banks, but have no impact 
 
14 
 
on the less risky ones. The authors suggest that regulators should increase their understanding of 
bank business models and how business models are connected to incentives for risk taking. 
In a study by Ayadi et al. (2011) of 26 large European banks, three major business models were 
identified: retail banks, investment banks and wholesale banks. Retail banks can be characterized by 
the fact that customer deposits are the primary source of funding and that they offer loans to the 
customers. Investment banks are in this case banks that have considerable trading and derivatives 
activities. Wholesale banks are banks that have focus on domestic business and are active in the 
wholesale markets. The study also investigated how different business models relate to bank 
performance, risk characteristics and systemic stability. 
How bank business models affect performance and risk is examined by Mergaerts and Vander 
Vennet (2016) in a study of 505 European banks over a period from 1998 to 2013. One of the 
findings was that retail-oriented banks performed better when considering both stability and 
profitability. Another finding was that diversification is positively correlated to profitability. 3.5
 Better Understanding at a System Level
Ayadi and De Groen (2014) studied banking business models in Europe in order to get a better 
understanding at a system level of, for example, risk behavior. The study was focused on large and 
systemic banking groups, in other words, banks that might trigger a financial crisis if they go 
bankrupt. Four different business models were identified: investment, wholesale, diversified retail 
and focused retail. Diversified retail and focused retail can be distinguished by their reliance on debt 
markets and customer deposit respectively. 3.6
 Finding Groups with High Similarity
Some studies, for example Ferstl and Seres (2012), have an objective of finding sets of variables 
reflecting business models of the banks and to find groups of banks with high similarity. In this 
study five different clusters were identified. The authors use three different income sources, loan-to-
deposit ratio and loan-to-asset ratio to characterize the business models. Another study with a 
similar objective is Roengpitya et al. (2014), but this study also focused on tracking how banks have 
changed their business models over time. In the study by Roengpitya et al. (2014) three bank 
business models were identified using balance sheet characteristics. The three identified business 
models were: retail-funded commercial bank, wholesale-funded commercial bank and capital 
markets-oriented bank. The first two business models mainly differ in how the banks are funded, 
while the third differs by being more active in the interbank market. 
 
 
 
15 
 3.7
 Interaction betweenBanking Sector and the Real Sector 
In a study by Vagizova et al. (2014) of Russian credit institutions, the authors used cluster analysis 
for determining business models. The report focused on how credit institutions interact with the real 
economy, which is the part of the economy that produces goods and services. One important aspect 
in this case is the opportunity for long-term lending to the real sector with banking sector stability in 
mind. According to the authors, there is an asymmetry in the interaction between the banking sector 
and the real sector due to differences in profitability and the risks taken for generating investment 
income. A conflict of interest between the central bank and the credit institutions occurs when 
financial resources from the central bank, aimed for long-term support of the real sector, are used by 
the credit institutions for making short-term profits. 3.8
 Results in Earlier Studies
In Table 7 results from earlier studies are presented. Only studies that found distinct groups are 
included in the table. For example, Mergaerts and Vander Vennet (2016), who found the European 
banking sector to be characterized by a continuum rather than discrete groups is therefore not 
presented. In earlier studies, there are great differences between studied areas and number of studied 
banks. For example, Ayadi et al. (2011) studied 26 major European banks while Vagizova et al. 
(2014) studied 836 Russian credit institutions. Roengpitya et al. (2014) and Ayadi et al. (2011) 
focused on the largest banks and three general business models were identified: retail, wholesale and 
investment banks. In contrast, studies limited to a single country identified a larger number of 
business models, in the range of four to six business models. Some authors did not name the 
identified clusters, which makes it difficult to describe them and only the identified number of 
clusters for those studies are presented in Table 7.

 Methodology
 
This section describes the methodology used in this study. Clustering of data can be done in many 
different ways. The applied methods vary greatly depending on which type of data to be clustered 
and the purpose of the clustering. The main focus in this study is extracting the most significant 
patterns in the data set in order to capture differences between Swedish credit institutions. The 
purpose is not to classify every company into a specific category – the goal is to find which general 
business models that exist. Swedish credit institutions and Swedish branches of foreign banks are 
clustered separately, since branches are part of larger foreign companies. 
In earlier studies, the variables used for clustering are selected by the authors based on their own 
expert or analytical judgment. This selection is subjective by nature and the selected variables are 
different from study to study. With no consensus regarding variables selection and with the belief 
that we would not do a good selection that would characterize companies active in the Swedish 
banking market; a different method has been applied in order to avoid this subjectivity. Instead of 
selecting variables, the used method creates new variables from a large set of original variables that 
captures the most essential information in the data set. In our opinion, the greatest drawback with 
the used method is that the individual variables might have great variance. By selecting a few 
variables for clustering, the observations in a cluster are more likely to have homogenous values for 
the variables used for clustering. Another great difference from earlier studies is that this study 
analyses if the found clusters actually are real clusters by considering the cluster stability. 
The methodology can be described as follows. First variables are identified from the data set and 
then observations considered as outliers are removed. Afterwards, observations considered as 
outliers are removed and the number of variables in the data set are then reduced from a high 
number of correlated variables to a lower number of uncorrelated ones using principal component 
analysis. This step includes deciding a suitable number of variables. Then hierarchical clustering is 
done on the observations using the lower number of variables. A suitable number of clusters is then 
decided and checked for stability. These steps are described in detail in the following sections. All 
programming was done in the programming language R. 4.1
 Identificationof Variables
The data used in this study are the annual financial data reported by companies to the Swedish FSA. 
Both balance sheet and income statement information are included. Data are expressed in Swedish 
Krona (SEK) and in order to obtain comparability between companies of different size, variables are 
formed as ratios. The denominator is either expressed as total assets, total equity and liabilities or 
 
18 
 
total income depending on the numerator. The posts in the reported data with very low impact, in 
other words, very low values in the numerator compared to the denominator, are aggregated in 
order to remove variables that have very low impact on the results. For example, prepayments and 
accrued income are included in other income instead of having them as separate variables. The posts 
used for forming variables are the posts in the standard report, used by the Swedish FSA for 
reporting financial data; see Chapter 5 and Appendix A for definitions. 4.2
 Removal of Outliers
The results from agglomerative hierarchical clustering (which is the method used for clustering) 
could be spoiled by a single outlier (Hennig, 2007). One definition of an outlier is an observation 
which appears to be inconsistent with the remainder of the data set (Barnett & Lewis, 1994). 
Clusters consisting of a single or a few observations do not make up general business models and 
are therefore of very limited interest. The reason for companies to become extremely different from 
the others is in most cases because they are part of a larger corporate group. In this case outliers 
would also influence the dimensionality reduction since outliers increase variance and influence how 
the principal components are found. 
If the asset side does not equal the liability side or the income statement variables does not equal 
total income, the observation is classified as an outlier, also observations that have one or several of 
the income statement variables above 1.5 or below -0.5 are considered as outliers. A value of 1.5 
means that for example net interest income is 150 % of total income and therefore at least one other 
income variable must have a negative value in order for the sum to be 100 %. Approximately 1 % of 
the observations could be considered as outliers. If observations with extreme values in one or 
several variables would be included, they would most likely yield clusters with one or a few 
observations due to how hierarchical clustering algorithms are designed. The selected range is 
chosen manually but the observations that are considered as outliers have extreme values, for 
example 3 or 4. Extreme observations of this magnitude would most likely form a separate cluster. 4.3
 Number of Dimensions
The data set contains 19 variables formed as balance sheet and income statement variables. Every 
variable in the data set can be seen as a dimension, for example an observation could be described as 
a point in a 19-dimensional hyperspace if the number of variables is 19. A small number of 
dimensions are relevant in most cases. The dimensions that are irrelevant could produce noise and 
also mask the real clusters to be discovered (Dash, et al., 2010). In order to get a meaningful 
clustering analysis with the most relevant information, dimensions are reduced before clustering the 
data. 
Dimensionality reduction is a concept of transforming high-dimensional data into a meaningful 
representation with reduced dimensionality. One type of dimensionality reduction is feature 
reduction, which is about extracting features by projection of high-dimensional data into a lower-
 
19 
 
dimensional space by using algebraic transformation. By applying a concept called principal 
component analysis to the data set the number of dimensions is reduced. At the same time, 
correlated variables are transformed to a reduced set of uncorrelated ones (Dash, et al., 2010). 4.4
 Principal Component Analysis 
As mentioned in the previous section, a concept called principal component analysis (PCA) is 
applied in order to reduce the number of dimensions for a data set with a large number of variables 
that are correlated and at the same time keep as much as possible of the variation in the data set 
(Jolliffe, 2002). The idea behind PCA is that all observations are in a hyperspace with several 
dimensions, but all these dimensions are not equally relevant. PCA finds the dimensions that are 
most relevant (James, et al., 2013). These dimensions are called principal components (Dash, et al., 
2010). The directions of the first two principal components span the plane that minimizes the sum 
of squared distances from each point to the plane, in other words the plane can be seen as the one 
best fitting the data. 
 
Figure 2 The first two principal components span the plan that best fits the data (James, et al., 2013) 
PCA can be mathematically defined as the projection of a data matrix 𝑋 on an 𝐴-dimensional 
subspace by using a projection matrix 𝑃′ where object coordinates are given by a matrix 𝑇. The 
columns in matrix 𝑇 are called score vectors and the rows in 𝑃′ are called loading vectors which are 
the direction coefficients of the principal component plane (Wold, et al., 1987). In Figure 2 the 
loading vectors would span the illustrated plane. The score vectors can be seen as the projection of 
the observations on the plane spanned by the principal components. The score vectors and the 
loading vectors are orthogonal. The difference between the projections and original coordinates are 
called the residuals, which are in the matrix 𝐸. In Figure 2 the residual is the difference between the 
data points and their projections on the plane spanned by the two principal components. 𝑥 is the 
mean vector (Wold, et al., 1987). 
 
 
 
20 
 
PCA in matrix form is the least square model: 
 
 
𝑋= 𝑥+ 𝑇𝑃′ + 𝐸  
(1) 
 
A basic assumption when using PCA is that the score and loading vectors corresponding to the 
largest eigenvalues are containing the most useful information and that the remaining ones mainly 
consist of noise (Wold, et al., 1987). An eigenvalue is a scalar associated with an eigenvector, which 
is a non-zero vector that does not change direction when linearly transformed. A larger eigenvalue 
means that the principal component has greater variance, in other words it contains more 
information. The principal components are therefore often written in order of descending 
eigenvalues. For further explanation of PCA and mathematical derivations, see Jolliffe (2002). iii 4.5
 Number of Principal Components
In order to determine a suitable number of principal components, several rules and techniques exist. 
In this thesis, the rule called size of variances of principal components is used for determining a 
suitable number of principal components. This is a rule-of thumb, mainly justified by the fact that it 
works in practice and is intuitive (Jolliffe, 2002). The rule is described more in detail below. 
The rule used is size of variances of the principal components, also called Kaiser’s rule. It is based 
on the idea that if all variables of the data matrix are independent, the principal components are 
equal to the original variables and therefore have unit variances in the correlation matrix. Any 
principal component with variance less than 1 contains less information than one of the original 
variables and could therefore be discarded. If the data set has groups of variables with large within-
group correlations, but small correlations between the groups, then one principal component 
associated with the group has variance above 1 and the other principal components associated with 
the group have variances below 1. Therefore the rule will in general retain only one principal 
component associated with each group of this type. The calculated matrix, is in this case, the 
covariance matrix. In order to apply the rule on the covariance matrix, the cut-off is set to the 
average value of the eigenvalues of the covariance matrix (Jolliffe, 2002). 4.6
 Clustering
The objective of using clustering methods is to discover groups whose members are close to each 
other and are well separated from the other clusters (Halkidi, et al., 2001). The clustering of data is 
not an exact science as there is no single solution to how data should be clustered. Classification of 
the same data set done by different clustering algorithms can differ significantly from each other due 
to the use of different clustering criteria (Gordon, 1998). If the chosen algorithm is the most optimal 
                                                 
iii The function used in R for calculating principal components is prcomp which uses singular value decomposition for 
the calculations. 
 
21 
 
for the data set in question is very difficult to validate. For this study a statistical clustering algorithm 
called Ward’s method is used. Within the field of clustering banks into different business models, 
the algorithm has been used in earlier studies such as Halaj and Zochowski (2009) and Roengpitya et 
al. (2014). The selection of the clustering algorithm is done based on an assumption that the data set 
in this study is similar to the data used in the mentioned earlier studies and therefore Ward’s method 
would be suitable also in this case. The method proposed by Ward (1963) is an agglomerative 
hierarchical clustering procedure, which means that each observation starts on its own and is 
successively built into groups. First the number of groups is equal to the number of observations. In 
the following steps, two groups from the previous step that minimize the loss of information are 
merged. This means that two observations are merged if no other pair of observations can be found 
that are closer to each other. Distance is calculated using Euclidean distance. The loss of 
information for a group of observations can be calculated by for example using the error sum of 
squares (ESS), which is used in this study. 
It is calculated as: 
 
 
𝐸𝑆𝑆= ∑𝑥𝑖
2
𝑛
𝑖=1
−1
𝑛(∑𝑥𝑖)
𝑛
𝑖=1
2
 
(2) 
 
In this case, every observation is described by a set of principal component variables and all 
variables are assumed to have equal relevance. In other words, every observation is described by a 
set of points (score vectors) that are positions on the principal components. The algorithm does not 
have any stopping mechanism and the steps of merging groups can be repeated until all observations 
are in the same group. Therefore it is necessary to decide when the algorithm should stop, in other 
words how many clusters that are suitable and this will be considered in the next section. 4.7
 Determining the Number of Clusters
When clustering analysis is performed on a data set, a problem is to decide the optimal number of 
clusters. Clustering algorithms classify all observations into clusters even if no real clusters exist 
(Gordon, 1998). This means that some kind of validation has to be made in order to determine if 
the identified clusters actually are clusters. There is no given answer on how to validate the results 
and several techniques exist for cluster validation. Cluster validation can be defined as a technique 
used to find a set of clusters that best fits the natural partitions of the data (Rendón, et al., 2011). 
Visualization of the data is one way of verifying that the results are reasonable, however with large 
multidimensional data visualization becomes difficult. In this case, visualization is not a suitable 
choice, as clustering analysis is performed in more than three dimensions. 
In order to select the most suitable number of clusters, two important aspects need to be 
considered. Firstly, the compactness, which means how close the observations of each cluster are to 
each other and the closer the observations are the better. Secondly, the separation, which means 
how far the clusters are spread out from each other, the further away they are from each other the 
 
22 
 
better (Halkidi, et al., 2001). In other words, the aim is to find a solution where the clusters are as far 
away from each other as possible while the observations in each cluster are as close to each other as 
possible. In this thesis, a range between 2 to 10 clusters is investigated. To have a single cluster 
would not be meaningful, since all observations would be in the same cluster and therefore give 
meaningless results. More than 10 clusters would mean that some clusters do not represent general 
business models. 
The method used in this study for determining the number of clusters is the Calinski-Harabasz 
index. This index introduced by Caliński and Harabasz (1974) is calculated for each clustering 
solution, in other words it is calculated for every solution in the investigated range of 2 to 10 
clusters. The number of clusters with highest index value is selected. In a study by Milligan and 
Cooper (1985) of different indices for determining the number of clusters, the Calinski-Harabasz 
index was found to be the best performing of the studied indices. This index is used in combination 
with Ward’s method in some earlier studies, for example Roengpitya et al. (2014). 
The index is calculated as: 
 
 
𝐵𝐺𝑆𝑆/(𝑘−1)
𝑊𝐺𝑆𝑆/(𝑛−𝑘) 
(3) 
 
𝐵𝐺𝑆𝑆 is the sum of squares between the clusters, in other words the separation between the 
clusters. 𝑊𝐺𝑆𝑆 is the sum of squares within the clusters, which is the compactness of the clusters. 𝑛 
is the number of observations and 𝑘 is the number of clusters. The index increases when the 
observations within a cluster are more similar and the clusters are more dispersed (Caliński & 
Harabasz, 1974). 4.8
 Cluster Stability
The stability in cluster analysis is strongly dependent on how homogenous and well separated the 
clusters are. Within the same clustering, there may be differences in how stable the clusters are, with 
some that may be very stable and others extremely unstable. Stable clusters could be described as 
meaningful clusters that do not easily disappear when changing the data set in a non-essential way. 
However, a stable cluster is not a guarantee for a meaningful pattern and meaningless clusters may 
sometimes be stable. In order to measure the cluster stability, the data is resampled using 
bootstrapping and the Jaccard coefficient is computed between the original clusters and the most 
similar clusters in the resampled data. Even if an observation is drawn several times, it is only used 
once in the bootstrap samples. The Jaccard coefficient between two sets of data is the proportion of 
observations included in both sets divided by all observations included in at least one of the sets 
(Hennig, 2007). 
 
 
 
23 
 
The Jaccard coefficient is calculated as: 
 
 
𝛾(𝐶, 𝐷) =
|𝐶∩𝐷|
|𝐶∪𝐷| , 𝐶, 𝐷 ⊆ 𝑋𝑛 
(4) 
 
𝐶 and 𝐷 are subsets of 𝑋𝑛which is the data set. In other words the coefficient describes how many 
observations that are included in both subset 𝐶 and 𝐷 divided by all unique observations in subset 𝐶 
and 𝐷 together (Hennig, 2007). There is no absolute criterion defining cluster stability. The 
following rule-of-thumbs for cluster stability are described in the R package fpciv and are used as an 
indication. In order to be a highly stable cluster the mean Jaccard coefficient should be above 0.85. 
A stable cluster should have a mean above 0.75. A value lower than 0.75 and higher than 0.6 could 
be considered as an indication of a pattern in the data, but it is doubtful which observations should 
belong to a cluster with a value within this range. v 
                                                 
iv https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fpc/fpc.pdf 
v The function used for calculating cluster stability is clusterboot from the R package fpc. The settings used are: 1000 
resampling runs and all observations drawn more than once in the bootstrap are only used once in the bootstrap 
samples.

 The Data Set
This section describes the data used in this study. First are the selection of companies and the 
identified variables described. Afterwards are the distribution and the median for each variable 
described using boxplots. 5.1
 Identification of Variables
The data set used consists of annual balance sheet and income statement data reported to the 
Swedish FSA by companies under their supervision. This study includes Swedish credit institutions 
and Swedish branches of foreign banks. The years used are 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2013. Only 
companies that are active at present are included in this study. Companies that have been sold or 
merged with another active company are also included. If a company was active for example in 
2005, but not classified as a credit market company or a bank at that time, the observation is not 
included. For companies that are part of a company group, the consolidated statements are used, as 
the balance and income statements of a group company could be non-representative of the business 
model. The use of consolidated statements means that foreign branches and subsidiaries are 
included in the group data. 
From the raw data the following variables are identified: 
1.  Cash at central banks and treasury bills/Total assets (CASH) 
2.  Lending to credit institutions/Total assets (CRE_LEND) 
3.  Lending to the public/Total assets (PUB_LEND) 
4.  Bonds and other interest-bearing securities/Total assets (BONDS) 
5.  Equities and shares/Total assets (EQUITIES) 
6.  Shares in associated and group companies/Total assets (ASSOCIATED) 
7.  Tangible assets/Total assets (TANGIBLE) 
8.  Other assets/Total assets (OTH_ASSETS) 
9.  Liabilities to credit institutions/Total equity and liabilities (CRED_LIAB) 
10.  Deposits and borrowing from the public/Total equity and liabilities (PUB_DEP) 
11.  Issued securities/Total equity and liabilities (ISS_SEC) 
12.  Other liabilities/Total equity and liabilities (OTH_LIAB) 
13.  Equity including untaxed reserves/Total equity and liabilities (EQUITY) 
14.  Net interest income/Total income (NET_INT) 
15.  Leasing income/Total income (LEASING) 
16.  Dividends received/Total income (DIV_REC) 
17.  Net commission income/Total income (NET_COMM) 
18.  Net result of financial transactions/Total income (NR_FIN) 
19.  Other operating income/Total income (OTH_INC) 
 
25 
 5.2
 Boxplots forSwedish Credit Institutions
In the data set 420 observations were identified fulfilling the criteria of being classified as a bank or a 
credit market company, being a sold company or an active company and not being a part of a larger 
company group. Sold companies are those that were bought by another active company and are now 
part of an active company. Of these observations two were discarded due to being outliers with one 
having 442 % in NET_INT and one having an error in total income. This leaves us with 418 
observations for the clustering. 95 of the observations are for the year 2000, 107 for 2005, 108 for 
2010 and 108 for 2013. 
In the following boxplots, the variables are shown more in detail. In these figures it can be seen that 
there are significant differences in both the median of the variables and in their distribution. The 
median, which are the bold lines in the boxes, are for most of the variables below 10 %. The median 
for PUB_LEND and PUB_DEP are the highest, 73 % and 79 % respectively, which show that 
many credit institutions borrow money from the public and lend it to the public.

 Boxplots for Swedish Branches of Foreign Banks
In the data set 56 observations were identified fulfilling the criteria of being classified as a Swedish 
branch of a foreign bank and active at present. Of these observations three were discarded due to 
being outliers with one having 343 % in NET_INT, one having 185% in NET_INT and one having 
175% in NET_COMM. This leaves us with 53 observations for the clustering. 6 of the observations 
are for the year 2000, 10 for 2005, 17 for 2010 and 20 for 2013. 
In the following boxplots the variables are shown in more detail. In these figures it can be seen that 
there are significant differences in both the median of the variables and in their distribution. The 
median is below 10 % for most of the variables. Compared to the boxplots for Swedish credit 
institutions, there are several differences between the boxplots. For example, the medians for 
PUB_LEND and PUB_DEP are significant lower. The medians for CRE_LEND and 
CRED_LIAB are the highest, 18 % and 33 % respectively, which show that some branches of 
foreign banks tend to borrow money from banks and credit institutions and lend it to credit 
institutions.

 Result
This section presents the results of the study. First are the results from clustering of Swedish credit 
institutions given and then are the results from clustering of Swedish branches of foreign banks 
presented. 6.1
 Swedish Credit Institutions6.1.1 Number of Principal Components
To select the number of principal components to use, Kaiser’s rule was applied, which means that 
the cut-off is set to the average of the eigenvalues, which is 0.0224 in this case. As can be seen in 
Appendix B, the eigenvalue for principal component number 5 is 0.0337 and the eigenvalue for 
principal component number 6 is 0.0195. Therefore 5 principal components are retained. 84 % of 
the variation in data set can be explained by combining these principal components. 
Table 8 presents how the variables influence the principal components. Some variables have a great 
influence on the principal components, for example NET_INT has a great loading on the first and 
second principal component. In contrast, NET_COMM has a great loading on the third to the fifth 
principal component. Some variables have a minimum influence on the principal components, for 
example CASH and DIV_REC.

Six clusters have been identified in the data set and we have named them: Universal banks, Savings 
banks, Leasing companies, Non-deposit funded credit institutions, Service-focused credit institutions and Other credit 
institutions. The names aim to give an interpretation of the kind of companies in these clusters. Table

Figure 9 Average income statement for all clusters Universal Banks
This cluster is named Universal banks, since it consists of the four largest banks and a few other 
companies. On average they derive 57 % of their total income from NET_INT. The asset side 
consists on average of 75 % in PUB_LEND. The liability side consists on average of 33 % in 
PUB_DEP and on average of 24 % in CRED_LIAB, but all variables on the liability side are above 
10 % on average. This cluster consists of 43 observations, with 10 observations in 2000 and 10 
observations in 2013. 
Table 11 presents characteristics over time for this cluster and average values are presented year-

 Savings Banks
This cluster is named Savings banks, since it consists of all Swedish savings banks. It also contains all 
members banks and some other credit institutions. On average they derive 69 % of their total 
income from NET_INT and on average 23 % of their total income from NET_COMM. The asset 
side consists on average of 74 % in PUB_LEND. The liability side consists on average of 81 % in 
PUB_DEP. This cluster consists of 296 observations, with 74 observations in 2000 and 76 
observations in 2013.

This cluster is named Leasing companies, since companies in this cluster gain most of their income 
from leasing. On average they derive 93 % of their total income from LEASING. The asset side 
consists on average of 48 % in TANGIBLE, which may give a better picture of how dependent 
these companies are on leasing. On average, these companies have 41 % of their assets as 
PUB_LEND. The liability side consists on average of 39 % in PUB_DEP. This cluster consists of 
26 observations, with 6 observations in 2000 and 6 observations in 2013. 
Table 13 presents characteristics over time for this cluster and average values are presented year-
wise. Net interest margin is not a good indicator for this cluster, since these companies gain most of 
their income from leasing. The cost/income ratio is the highest over time when comparing with 
other clusters.

 Non-deposit Funded Credit Institutions
This cluster is named Non-deposit funded credit institutions, since companies in this cluster do not use 
deposits from the public as a key source for financing. On average they derive 92 % of their total 
income from NET_INT. The asset side consists on average of 70 % in PUB_LEND and on average 
of 20 % in BONDS. The liability side consists on average of 80 % in ISS_SEC. For example a local 
government funding agency and an export credit agency can be found in this cluster. Also the non-
deposit funded banks can be found in this cluster. This cluster consists of 19 observations, with 4 
observations in 2000 and 5 observations in 2013. 
Table 14 presents characteristics over time for this cluster and average values are presented year-
wise. Observations in this cluster have an average total income per year of approximately 1 % of 
total assets, which is low compared to other clusters. The low ratio compared to other clusters, is 
because these companies gain a very small amount of their income from activities outside the 
balance sheet, in other words they are focused on lending and borrowing.

Table 14 Characteristics over time for Non-deposit funded credit institutions Service-focused Credit Institutions
This cluster is named Service-focused credit institutions, since companies in this cluster gain most of their 
income from services classified as commission in the income statement. On average they derive 66 
% of their income from NET_COMM, however three observations gain the majority of the income 
from NR_FIN. The asset side consists on average of 45 % in PUB_LEND and on average of 26 % 
in CRE_LEND. The liability side consists on average of 60 % in PUB_DEP. This cluster consists 
of 23 observations with 0 in 2000 and 9 in 2013. Some of these companies were not banking or 
credit market companies during the earlier years. 
Table 15 presents characteristics over time for this cluster and average values are presented year-
wise. Since there were no observations for 2000 in this cluster, no average values can be created for 
this year. Net interest margin has increased over time. Total income/total assets and return on assets 
has decreased over time.

 Other Credit Institutions
This cluster is named Other credit institutions, since companies in this group gain almost all their 
income from other income. On average they derive 95 % of their total income from OTH_INC. 
The asset side consists on average of 53 % in PUB_LEND and on average of 23 % in 
OTH_ASSETS. The liability side consists on average of 37 % in PUB_DEP and on average of 35 % 
in EQUITY. This cluster is the smallest one with 11 observations which is 3 % of total 
observations. For 2000 this cluster has 1 observation and for 2013 it has 2 observations. It is 
difficult to interpret from the data what the companies in this cluster do. 
Table 16 presents characteristics over time for this cluster and average values are presented year-
wise. Due to the small amount of observations, the averages vary a lot. Since it is difficult to 
interpret what these companies do, it is also difficult to draw any general conclusions from Table 16.

Table 16 Characteristics over time for Other credit institutions 6.1.4 Cluster Stability
In order to determine whether the clusters are built up from random observations or from actual 
patterns in the data set, the cluster stability is checked using bootstrapping on resampled data and 
the Jaccard coefficient is calculated. By using Ward’s method for clustering, all observations are 
classified into clusters, which means that even if an observation do not naturally belong to any 
general cluster it is classified into one anyway. A high Jaccard coefficient indicates a high stability 
which means that the companies in the cluster have a high similarity.

Table 17 Jaccard coefficients for the six clusters 
 
In Table 17 it can be seen that the cluster called Savings banks can be considered as highly stable, this 
is also the case with Leasing companies and Service-focused credit institutions. Non-deposit funded credit 
institutions can be considered as a stable cluster. Other credit institutions should be seen as an indication 
of a pattern rather than a cluster. For Universal banks there is very weak support for forming a cluster 
 
35 
 
and it may be more appropriate to see it as a residual where those companies that do not fit into the 
other clusters end up. By looking at the observations in the cluster called Universal banks it can be 
seen that it consists of quite different types of companies, for example the four large banks can be 
found in this cluster and so are a few observations that have 0 % in PUB_DEP. A few of the 
observations also derive more than ⅓ of total income from OTH_INC. In other words, it can 
hardly be described as a homogenous cluster of companies. 6.1.5 Time Perspective
Table 18 shows the number of companies in each cluster for different years. The difference in the 
number of companies over the years mainly depends on sold companies and new companies. Also 
companies changing clusters affect the numbers, which is demonstrated in detail in Table 19. 
For all clusters, except the Service-focused credit institutions, the number of companies remains almost 
constant. Service-focused credit institutions did not exist in 2000, but in 2013 the cluster consisted of 9 
companies, which means that it is a new type of business model on the Swedish banking market.

Table 19 shows the number of companies changing to each cluster. 418 observations are used in this 
study and the absolute majority of the companies have remained in their cluster over time. A total of 
15 changes were found and most transfers were made to Savings banks. In many cases, it was caused 
by mergers or acquisitions, which has led to relatively sharp changes in the companies’ balance sheet 
and income statement. In many cases PUB_LEND and PUB_DEP have been the factors that have 
changed the most. Also changes in NET_INT and LEASING are common when a company 
changed clusters.

Below follows two examples of companies that have changed cluster. TF Bank AB has changed 
from Universal banks to Savings banks from 2005 to 2010. The reason for this change was that the 
company introduced savings accounts for their customers. Before 2005, the company had only 
engaged in personal loans and sales finance. Marginalen group has changed from Other credit 
institutions to Savings banks from 2010 to 2013. The company acquired several companies during this 
period which caused the change. 6.2
 Swedish Branches of Foreign Banks6.2.1 Number of Principal Components
To select the number of principal components to use, Kaiser’s rule was applied, which means that 
the cut-off is set to the average of the eigenvalues, which is 0.0712 in this case. As can be seen in 
Appendix C, the eigenvalue for principal component number 6 is 0.0711. Therefore 5 principal 
components are retained. 84 % of the variation in data set can be explained by combining these 
principal components. 
Table 20 presents how the variables influence the principal components. Some variables have a great 
influence on the principal components. For example, OTH_INC has a loading above 0.1 for all the 
5 principal components. In this case the variables ISS_SEC and ASSOCIATED have no influence 
on the principal components and some other variables have a minimum influence on the principal 
components.

 Banks
This cluster is named Banks, due to that the asset side mainly consists of lending to the public. On 
average they derive 42 % of their total income from NET_INT, 27 % from LEASING and 24 % of 
NET_COMM. The asset side consists on average of 66 % in PUB_LEND. The liability side 
consists on average of 63 % in CRED_LIAB and on average of 28 % in PUB_DEP. Included in 
this cluster is for example the fifth largest bank in Sweden in terms of total assets. This cluster 
consists of 25 observations, with 4 observations in 2000 and 10 observations in 2013. Service-focused Credit Institutions
This cluster is named Service-focused credit institutions, since branches in this cluster gain most of their 
income from services classified as commissions in the income statement. On average they derive 89 
% of their total income from NET_COMM. The asset side consists on average of 62 % in 
CRE_LEND and on average of 24 % in OTH_ASSETS. Three of the observations have a 
significant part of their asset side as EQUITIES, while the rest has 0 % in that post. The liability 
side consists on average of 60 % OTH_LIAB. The branches in this cluster are almost all branches 
of large foreign investment banks. This cluster consists of 14 observations, with 2 observations in 
2000 and 3 observations in 2013. Other Credit Institutions
This cluster is named Other credit institutions, since branches in this group generate almost all their 
income from other income. On average they derive 91 % of their total income from OTH_INC, 
which makes it difficult to interpret what kind of business they are engaged in in Sweden. The asset 
side consists on average of 47 % in CRE_LEND and on average of 39 % in OTH_ASSETS. The 
liability side consists on average of 57 % in OTH_LIAB and on average of 23 % in EQUITY. 
Several of the branches in this cluster could be considered as investment banks. For almost all 
observations, the total assets are in the range of 0-200 MSEK, with several in the lower part of the 
range. This cluster consists of 14 observations, with 0 observations in 2000 and 7 observations in 
2013. 6.2.4 Cluster Stability
As mentioned in Section 6.1.4, cluster stability is investigated to determine whether the clusters are 
built up from random observations or from actual patterns in the data set. In Table 23 are the 
Jaccard coefficients for the three clusters presented. 
 
Cluster

Banks 
0.97 
Service-focused credit institutions 
0.95 
Other credit institutions 
0.93 
Table 23 Jaccard coefficients for the three clusters 
 
40 
 
As can be seen in Table 23, the lowest value is 0.93. In order to be a highly stable cluster, the rule-
of-thumb is that the coefficient should be above 0.85. Therefore all three clusters can be considered 
as highly stable. 6.2.5 Time Perspective
Table 24 shows the number of branches in each cluster for different years. The difference in the 
number of branches over the years mainly depends on new branches. One branch changed cluster 
during the time period and it changed from a Service-focused credit institution to a Bank. 
The number of Swedish branches of foreign banks has increased from 2000 to 2013. The increase 
can mainly be seen in the clusters called Banks and Other credit institutions.

 Discussion
This section presents and discusses the answers to the two research questions. The reliability, 
validity, generalizability and sustainability of the study are then discussed. 
The first research question was how Swedish credit institutions should be categorized. This question 
was divided into two sub-questions and the first sub-question was how many categories are suitable. 
The Calinski-Harabasz index was used to find the most suitable number of clusters. For Swedish 
credit institutions six clusters were found and, in order to describe their businesses, they were named 
Universal banks, Savings banks, Leasing companies, Non-deposit funded credit institutions, Service-focused credit 
institutions and Other credit institutions. For Swedish branches of foreign banks three clusters were 
found and they were named Banks, Service-focused credit institutions and Other credit institutions. 
The second sub-question concerned distinct features for the categories. The business models for the 
six identified clusters among Swedish credit institutions are described below. The cluster called 
Universal banks has the most diversified liability side of the balance sheet; with a mix of equity, 
liabilities to credit institutions, issued securities, deposits and borrowings from the public and other 
liabilities. The cluster called Savings banks derives approximately ⅔ of their income from net interest 
income and approximately ¼ from net commission income. Leasing companies gain almost all their 
income from leasing and the asset side has a relative high share of tangible assets. Non-deposit funded 
credit institutes derives an absolute majority of their income from net interest income and finance 
themselves to a great extent by issuing securities. Service-focused credit institutions includes companies 
that gain almost all their income from either net commission income or net results of financial 
transactions. Other credit institutions derive an absolute majority of their income from other income 
and have on average a diversified asset and liability side. This cluster has the lowest number of 
observations. 
The business models for the three identified clusters for Swedish branches of foreign banks are 
described below. The cluster called Banks has the most diversified income and liability side. The 
asset side mainly consists of lending to the public. This cluster has the highest number of 
observations. Service-focused credit institutions derive the absolute majority of their income from net 
commission income. The branches in this cluster are to a great extent branches of large foreign 
investment banks. Other credit institutions derive almost all their income from other income. The 
liability side and the asset side have a relative high share of other liabilities and other assets 
respectively. 
 
42 
 
The second research question was whether Swedish credit institutions change categories over time. 
In total 418 year-end observations of Swedish credit institutions and 53 of Swedish branches of 
foreign banks were used in this study. In the investigated time period, 15 Swedish credit institutions 
and one Swedish branch of foreign banks have changed clusters. The main reasons for changing 
category between years are mergers or acquisitions. Since only a few companies changed clusters, the 
general answer is that most credit institutions do not change categories over time. 
In this study only companies active at present or companies that have been sold during the studied 
period were included. The data used were from the years 2000, 2005, 2010 and 2013. Another 
selection of companies and/or different years could alter the results, for example would small 
changes in the characteristics of the clusters occur if other years were used. No consensus exists 
regarding how business models should be studied using cluster analysis. This means that if another 
method was used, the results could have been different. The method in this study use principal 
components which mean that no variables are selected manually. Almost all earlier studies have 
manually selected variables for clustering and therefore we argue that this business model study has 
a relatively high reliability. Since there are many methods for clustering, other companies and other 
years can be used, it is however questionable to draw a general conclusion that there are six different 
business models for Swedish credit institutions and three different for Swedish branches of foreign 
banks. 
To put the results of this study in relation to other studies, the results found are similar to those 
found by Halaj and Zochowski (2009) when studying the Polish banking market. That study also 
identified six clusters and some of them are very similar to those found in this study. The cluster 
named Universal banks was found in both studies. Car finance banks are very similar to Leasing 
companies, since several of the companies in that group are specialized in financing vehicles. Mortgage 
banks is a bit similar to Non-deposit funded credit institutions, since these derive almost all income from 
net interest income. The similarities for the other groups are difficult to interpret. On the other hand 
the banking markets are different and the results cannot be expected to be equal. 
When considering the purpose of the study, this study is in line with Ferstl and Seres (2012) and 
Roengpitya et al. (2014) since these studies aim to find groups with high similarities and place less 
emphasis on the risk aspect. Roengpitya et al. (2014) found the main differences are dependent on 
how the banks are funded, while in this study the differences are mainly found in how they generate 
their income. Ferstl and Seres (2014) also use loan-to-deposit ratio in the clustering, which would 
have been difficult to use in this study, due to the fact that some companies do not use deposits to 
fund their operations. However, it might be suitable when considering large banks, as deposits is 
their main source of funding. 
One drawback with the method used when comparing with manual selection of variables for 
clustering is that for some individual variables, for example lending to the public, the intra-group 
difference is high. This can be seen in Appendix D and E. By selecting a few variables for cluster 
 
43 
 
analysis, the clusters will have less variance in the clustered variables. However when doing so, the 
clusters are formed based on the selected variables. 
There can be differences in how companies report their data to the Swedish FSA, which will affect 
the study’s validity. There is a risk that companies report their data in different ways even if the data 
is of the same type. In our study, it has been assumed that the items called other income, other 
assets and other liability can be used in clustering and that companies define them in the same way. 
However, there is no guarantee that the companies define them the same way and therefore there is 
a risk that differences appear in these categories. For the cluster called Other credit institutions the 
majority of the income is from other income and therefore is it doubtful if this cluster can be seen as 
a cluster. Another assumption that has been made is that the identified variables can be used to 
describe the business model. 
This study has a high generalizability since the method do not need a manual selection of variables 
and no individual assumptions has to be made to find the variables that are most important. This 
means that the method works both for companies of different sizes and with different activities. The 
method used in this study can, for example, be used for clustering of banks also in other countries. 
Studying bank business models can be related to sustainability. Stable banking and financial systems 
can limit the risk for new financial crisis similar to the one seen during 2007-2008. Understanding of 
how banks and other credit institutions do business is important for supervision aiming at a stable 
financial system. This study can help to improve the understanding of the Swedish credit institutions 
and be used as a basis for future developments within the area of linking risks to business models.

 Conclusion
This section describes the conclusions of the study and discusses topics for future research. 
The aim with this study was to investigate whether clusters in the Swedish banking sector exist in 
terms of business models, and to find clusters with similar business models. The study shows that 
clusters of companies with similar business models can be found. Swedish credit institutions and 
Swedish branches of foreign banks were studied separately. 
The most suitable number of clusters for Swedish credit institutions, when considering only 
companies active at present, was six. For illustrative purposes the clusters were named as follows: 
Universal banks, Savings banks, Leasing companies, Non-deposit funded credit institutions, Service-focused credit 
institutions and Other credit institutions. The most stable clusters were Savings banks and Leasing companies. 
The cluster with the lowest stability was Universal banks, which can be seen more as a pattern in the 
data rather than as a cluster. The four largest Swedish banks were included in this cluster. For 
Swedish branches of foreign banks, three clusters were found to be most suitable. To show the 
characteristics of the clusters, the clusters were named as follows: Banks, Service-focused credit institutions 
and Other credit institutions. All three clusters were found to be stable. 
With few exceptions companies stayed in the same cluster over time, which indicates that business 
models in almost all cases do not change drastically. If a company changed clusters between years, it 
was usually due to mergers or acquisitions. 8.1
 Future Studies
For future studies three aspects are recommended to focus on: find smaller clusters, investigate how 
the business models are connected to risk, and utilize more granular data. 
The conclusions regarding business models in this study are of general nature, since the method 
used cannot validate results with a further breakdown of the business models. From a supervision 
perspective it would be interesting to have more clusters with fewer companies, to get a more 
detailed overview of the banking sector. With more clusters, it would be interesting to examine how 
clusters relate to each other over time, for example, by examining whether two clusters become 
more or less similar over time. This kind of information can be useful to predict the future and to 
understand if one cluster is in need of more intense supervision, which for example could be the 
case if a cluster deviates from its previous pattern. With more clusters it is easier to find 
discrepancies, both at cluster level and at company level. To find more clusters and to validate the 
 
45 
 
results a different method than the one used in this study is required, since the used method 
indicates a relative low number of clusters. 
It would be interesting to investigate how the business models are connected to different types of 
risks. For example, how sensitive they are to significant changes in interest rates. Knowledge about 
which clusters are exposed to which risks can be used in order to understand which clusters will be 
affected by, for example, a macroeconomic event or regulatory changes. By having an understanding 
of which clusters are affected by certain events, an indication of which clusters may need further 
monitoring is obtained. 
The reported data to the Swedish FSA contains very specific details regarding for example 
distribution of lending to different categories such as Swedish municipalities, households and non-
financial companies. One suggestion for further studies is to use more granular data for clustering, 
which means a further breakdown of the variables used in this study into a more detailed level. By 
doing so, we believe that companies with different niches can be found, for example companies 
specializing in lending to Swedish municipalities.
