Abstract 
 
 
The Swedish company Thermia uses for its Air Conditioning and Heating 
Pumps systems scroll compressors from the American Manufacturer 
Copeland. Despite the substantial reduction of noise that these type of 
compressor present in comparison to the piston compressor they still have a 
sound pressure level of 56 dBA. This sound level is unacceptable for a 
domestic usage when placing the compressor in living areas like the kitchen. 
The company has great interest in reducing the sound levels of the 
equipment as a whole. 
This report presents a dynamical analysis of the possible causes of noise 
coming from the scroll compressor. It involves a deep study of the operation 
of the present model of scroll compressor and several proposals for 
improving the design. 
During the study, one of the main components of the system was 
discovered to be unbalanced. The so-called Oldham coupling oscillates with a 
double frequency the compressor rotates. The report presents a number of 
solutions based on the original design and minimizing the modifications on 
it. Mathematical explanation and rough designs are given for these 
suggestions.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
In December 2005 the Social the prime minister Göran Persson committed Sweden 
into one of the most ambitious challenges for a country: to be oil independent in 2020. The 
goal of Sweden now is to live on environmentally friendly power resources such as 
hydropower, wind, sun, biomass and ethanol. Sweden is one of the most advanced lands in 
eco-politics. It was in 1980 when the country acquired a policy of phasing out nuclear power 
by 2010. The nuclear power supports 40-50 % of the Swedish electrical consumption while 
renewable energies (mainly hydropower and biomass) are up to 26 %. The debate has been on 
in the commission that studied the determined measures to reach the goal of oil independence 
in 2020. Being independent of both nuclear power and petrol is due now by 2020. 
In 1979 the accident in the nuclear plant Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station 
(U S) started the polemics about nuclear power in Sweden. The referendum in 1980 about the 
future of nuclear power made the parliament decide not to build more power plants in Sweden 
and began a phase-out due in 2010. A few observers have condemned the referendum, as the 
three vote options were negative to nuclear power in different degrees.  
Several polls done in recent years have shown that public opinion about nuclear power 
has substantially changed. Swedish population fears that Sweden will lose its international 
competitiveness if switching off nuclear power. Most of them support maintaining or even 
increasing nuclear power in Sweden. 
There is also scepticism on the oil independence among the Swedish. In 2005 oil 
supplies provided up to 32% of the energy consumption in Sweden. The commission report in 
June 2006 suggested the following targets: 
 
- 
Reduction of road transport in 40-50 %. 
- 
Consumption of oil in industry to be cut off by 25-40 %. 
- 
Phase out the Heating systems supplied by oil. 
- 
Increase the efficiency of energy usage by 20%. 
 
These measurements crave large implications for the companies established in 
Sweden, the institutions and the citizens. The Swedish car industry, Scania, Volvo and Saab 
among others, has stepped up encouraging the measurements. Bifuel, Hybrid and small Bio-
diesel cars are being developed to fulfil the demands. The Housing stocks should be renewed 
in order to change direct electric heating systems by District Heating, Biomass or Heating 
Pumps. 
It is not difficult to imagine that both phasing out from oil and nuclear power are going 
to increase the price of the electricity in the country during the future years. The actual price 
of the kWh for the private user in Sweden is over the European average of 0.10 €, not only 
that but also the price of the natural gas is only inferior to the one in Denmark and Portugal. 
The average Swedish citizen is receptive to eco-policies but wants to be preparing for 
these events. The biggest fraction of the electrical consumption in a particular home is the 
Heating System or Air Conditioning. The private user is looking for options. Other resources 
are wood in pellets or solar panels. Wood gives a price of 0.01 €/ kWh, which is low, but 
there needs to be further research into increasing the efficiency of its burning in gasifiers, etc. 
Solar panels are a good co-option but cannot be the only power source of a single house, 40-
50 m2 of solar panels would be needed to provide energy supply to a 4-5 members family. 
Even with the panels sunny days are not secured. District Heating is a good option. Obviously

District Heating is not a personal option, but a decision for the constructors of the new 
housing areas or for the owners’ community to make. 
The other option is to reduce the electrical consumption by using a Heating Pump. An 
already owner of a single home should choose a Heating Pump while technology does not 
develop other systems. A Heating Pump uses electricity to extract energy from the 
environment and transforms it into heat.

2. HEATING PUMP 
 
A Heating Pump is a machine that moves heat from low temperature to high 
temperature. According to the second law of thermodynamics a low temperature environment 
cannot heat a warm environment without work being provided. The high temperature 
environment gets the thermal energy extracted from the low temperature source plus the work 
applied. 
 
Fig. 1. Schema of a Heating Pump. 
 
The transference is made by means of a low evaporation temperature fluid. This fluid 
is heated and evaporated in the low temperature source. The gas is compressed in the 
compressor and led to the warm area. In the warm environment the gas is expanded and 
liquidized. The previous mentioned processes release thermal energy that heats the room. 
Figure1above shows a simple schema for a Heating Pump. 
As a heating system for a housing stock the warm environment would be the exterior 
in this case. The sun heats the surface of the earth constantly so a heating pump is a device 
that transforms solar energy into heat.  
Depending on the emplacement of the house higher or lower temperatures are given 
during the winter months. A Heating Pump is characterised by the coefficient of performance 
defined as the coefficient of the Heat released into the warm environment and the work 
provided by the compressor. For a Carnot cycle; being QH, the heat released to the hot room; 
QC , the heat extracted from the cold source; TH and TC their respective temperatures in 
Kelvin; and W the work applied, the performance coefficient would be defined as:

This coefficient implies that the lower the difference between temperatures is, the 
higher the efficiency would be. In Sweden, winter temperatures can reach easily –20ºC or 
even -30ºC. The best option is to extract heat from the hottest temperature source near the 
house. The air temperature is very cold but ground and water store solar energy for longer 
time so their temperatures are much higher. A Heating pump can be installed to interchange 
heat with the air, the ground or a close lake (relatively common in Sweden).

In the figure below, the four available options for extracting heat from different cold 
mediums are shown. The first one shows most common type of Heating Pump in Spain, 
which is the Air Heating Pump. This Heating Pump exchanges heat with the exterior air. It is 
also the cheapest option as the ground does not have to be drilled and there is no interference 
with the landscape. The second figure shows a rough schema of how to exchange heat with 
the unfrozen water of a close lake. The third and fourth figures show the possibilities of 
exchanging heat either with the ground or the rocks under the house. These options crave high 
investments to drill the earth and set the pipes of the evaporator but work at a higher TC, 
which increases the coefficient of performance. These ones are so called Geothermal Heating 
Pumps.

3. SUITABLE COMPRESSORS FOR HEATING PUMPS 
 
A Heating Pump has exactly the same thermodynamic cycle as an Air Conditioning 
system has. The only difference is that the cold room is the exterior in the outside for the first 
case and the interior in the second case. Refrigeration companies use three kinds of 
compressors in their systems. 
 
 
CAPACITY RANGE (kWh) 
Screw compressor 
15-120 
Scroll compressor 
1-28 
Reciprocating 
compressor 
5-448 
Table 1. Capacity range for different compressor applied in the refrigerating industry. 
 
All these compressors are positive displacement machines, this means that they work 
intermittently. A fixed gas volume is suctioned in the intake and compressed until the outlet 
expels it. The shape of the surfaces that compress the volume and how this compression 
occurs is different. 
The average Heating Pump unit requires a heat capacity of 10 kWh. The screw 
compressor is out of this range, which leaves us with two possible choices: a reciprocating 
compressor or a scroll compressor. 
 
Reciprocating compressor characteristics 
 
 The reciprocating compressor is used in many industries because it is able to deliver 
high pressures with variable load. They can be run by either electrical motors or internal 
combustion. A reciprocating compressor uses pistons attached to a crankshaft. The 
piston/pistons are placed inside of cylinder cavities where they slide to compress the gas. The 
figure shows a reciprocating compressor with two pairs of pistons. 
 
 
Fig. 3. Reciprocating compressor. 
 
The principle of reciprocating machines is a couple of hundreds years old therefore 
enormous research and development has been done on it. As a result this machine is one of 
the best known in mechanics, which is a great advantage. 
The reciprocating compressor is constructed in order to have a fixed displacement but 
several methods are used to control the cylinders’ capacity. Some examples would be 
clearance pockets, remote operated valves or valve unloader.

Since the valves closing or opening interrupt discharge and charge flow, the suction 
pressure gets an unsteady component. This is called pulsation and it is not sinusoidal which 
means that it has a fundamental frequency and several harmonics. The pulsation is translated 
into a high sound pressure level, in other words, noise. 
 
 Scroll compressors 
 
As shown in table the scroll compressor capacity is in the range of the needs of a 
Heating Pump. The advantages with its ancestor in this field, the reciprocating compressor are 
a reduced size for the same capacity and a reduction in noise which makes it suitable for its 
placement inside the living area of a private home.

The characteristics and operation of the scroll compressor are detailed in following chapters.

4. OPERATION OF THE SCROLL COMPRESSOR 
 
4.1 History 
 
Scroll compressors are orbital motion, positive displacement machines that compress 
the fluids between two meshing scroll surfaces. Leon Creux first discovered the scroll 
compressor in 1905. Theory indicated that the machine was reliably efficient but at that time 
the existing technology could not provide the accuracy in the manufacture of the scrolls.  
It took almost 65 years until a refrigeration company resuscitated the concept. 
Development continued primarily in Japan and USA and began to be commercialised in the 
1990’s. Today it is widely used in both Air Conditioning and Heating Pump systems because 
its operation is quiet enough for domestic usage.   
The commercialisation of the scroll compressor as a solution for refrigerating systems 
began in the mid nineties. Copeland was a pioneer in the US. The success was substantial due 
to the reduction in noise of this type of compressors. Soon Copeland’s competitors in the 
refrigerating sector woke up and tried to join the new trend. Some of them like Bristol 
Compressors or Carrier have developed their one line of models. Others like Tecumseh 
Products have not succeeded. Still 9 out of 10 scroll compressors for refrigerating systems in 
the US are Copeland compressors.  
Japanese companies such Hitachi, Mitsubishi or Matsushita (Panasonic in US) have 
been rough competitors in the scroll compressor race. In 1978, Hitachi was the first company 
in the second half of the twentieth century to patent a model of scroll compressor. It was not 
until ten years later that Carrier or Copeland joined the race. 
Nowadays in Europe, there are two big scroll compressor manufacturers. These are the 
Danish Danfoss and the German Bitzer.  
Though the main application of scroll compressors is for domestic air conditioning the 
Japanese company Sanden has developed scroll compressors for automotive air conditioning. 
 
4.2 Geometry 
 
The shape of the scroll surfaces is involute curves. An involute spiral can be described 
as the trajectory of the end point of a tight cord unwinding from a cylindrical surface as figure 
5 shows. The radius of the cylindrical surface would be called the base circle radius, which is 
the characteristic size of an involute surface.  In pure mathematical terms these curves are 
normal to every tangent to the base circle. 
 
 
Fig. 5. Circle involute.

The involute parametrical equations are written below, where R is the radius of the 
base circle.

When the surfaces in contact are involute curves every contact point would be at a 
tangent of both base circles so the contact forces are completely perpendicular and therefore 
no sliding occurs. 
This particular geometry is similar to the tooth geometry in spur gears. When two 
involute surfaces move with respect to each other, the movement is pure rolling with no 
sliding. This property allows the scroll members to mesh smoothly and increase the 
compressor’s efficiency.  
 
4.3 The scroll set 
 
The scrolls are two identical spiral surfaces fixed to a solid flat base. One is turned 
180º with respect to the other. One of the scrolls is fixed while the other is eccentrically 
mounted on the drive shaft. A special designed coupling is needed to prevent the rotation by 
just allowing the trajectory along the orbital path. This would be the Oldham coupling. The 
direction of rotation is fixed with the shape of the spirals, in the opposite direction the 
machine would theoretically work as a turbine: if the unwinding direction is clockwise, one of 
the spirals should move clockwise to act as a compressor and vice versa.  
 
Fig. 6. The scroll set. 
 
4.4 Compression process  
 
The gas enters the compressor at the same time in both openings diametrically 
opposed. The flanks of the scrolls form crescent shaped pockets. The gas pockets reduce its 
size as the orbiting scroll moves until the gas is released in the central port of the fixed scroll. 
Figure 7 shows the variation in the trapped gas pockets. 
 
The first pocket marked “1” in diagram A of figure 7 contains the first ingestion of gas 
from outside that has just been contained. The black scroll in the figure rotates clockwise with 
respect to the other scroll. After rotating 90º (diagram B) the pocket has reduced its volume 
and therefore the pressure has increased. After a complete cycle the gas in pocket marked “2” 
will be in the position of the pocket marked “3” in diagram A. At this point the compressed 
gas is released through the central hole.

Fig. 7. Operation of the scroll compressor. 
  
4.5 Compliance and sealing 
 
The compliance is a concept that is commonly used by the scroll compressor 
manufacturers. Radial compliance implies that the orbiting scroll performs a flexible path 
determined by the contact with the fixed scroll. Axial compliance would be then the ability of 
the upper and lower scroll to separate axially. A non-compliant scroll compressor follows a 
fixed orbiting path where spirals flanks never touch.  
A radial compliant machine uses the contact between the stationary and the orbiting 
scroll as sealing technique. The design provides also wear “in” in comparison to all the other 
machines that wear out. Its own relative movement polishes the wall surfaces, which reduces 
leakage, improving its efficiency after many hours running. 
The axial leakage, which is more critical, occurs between the scroll vanes tip and the 
opposite vane plate. Axially compliant compressors, like the models from Copeland, use the 
gas pressure to load the stationary scroll against the moving one.

4.6 Common industrial applications of the scroll compressor 
 
The scroll compressor has a higher efficiency that other compressors in its size range. 
As a result of this, it uses less electrical energy than others. With the price of a kWh 
increasing, both private users and  companies with 20% to 50% of their electricity 
consumption coming from refrigeration are interested in reducing their electricity usage.  
The dairy industry in USA has changed into scroll compressors gradually. In a regular 
dairy farm more than 25% of the electrical energy is used for cooling the milk products. 
Obviously the farmers have noticed a substantial reduction in their bills. 
The next industry that should be interested should be the food industry. With the new 
scroll compressors, available for walk-in coolers and freezers, the restaurants and convenience 
stores should reduce their bills around 18%. 
The report has already commented about the reduction of the electrical cost for private 
users by using a Heating Pump or an Air Conditioner System with a scroll compressor. 
Years ago the scroll compressor was developed by Sanden to fit like an air conditioner 
for personal cars. Several models of car have compatible scroll compressors as optional 
extras.

For the study of the pieces inside the machine the compressor packaging was cut with 
a radial saw around the upper part. It allowed extracting the scrolls, the Oldham-ring and the 
pieces involved in the braking device. The mixture of refrigerating fluid, in this case R410A, 
and oil was removed. Then the four bolts that join the fixed scroll with the supporting part 
were also removed. 
 
5.1 Machine’s strip down 
 
The fixed scroll 
 
The upper scroll is machined from carbon steel blank that is cast into the basic scroll 
shape. It has an upper cavity that hosts the outlet of the refrigerant circuit as well as the device 
that enables axial compliance of the compressor. It is fixed to the bearing housing by four 
bolts. The Oldham coupling pins slide inside a pair of slots made in the stationary scroll.  
 
 
Fig. 9. Stationary scroll. 
 
 
DYNAMIC ANALYSIS OF A SCROLL COMPRESSOR 
___________________________________________________________ 
 
12
 
The orbiting scroll 
 
The lower scroll is also made of carbon steel casts and almost fully machined. High-
speed computer controlled milling machines permit the manufacturing of twin scrolls. Apart 
from the scroll surface and the flat bottom plank, it has two slots that join it to the Oldham 
coupling and the housing for the engagement to the crank pin of the shaft. 
 
Fig. 10. Orbiting scroll. 
 
The Oldham coupling 
 
The Oldham-coupling is cast in aluminium and subsequently machined. It is placed 
between the main bearing housing and the orbiting scroll. The four pins slide in pairs inside 
the slots of the scroll mountings. 
 
 
Fig. 11. Oldham coupling. 
 
The bearing 
 
The bearing is made of steel. It is machined to fit in the orbital pin of the crankshaft 
and inside the orbiting scroll. The hydrodynamic thrust bearing resist the axial forces due to 
the pressure changes inside the vanes while supporting the orbiting scroll. The transmission of 
the movement is made by means of a flat surface both in the bearing and the shaft as the 
image of the bearing shows.

Fig. 12. The bearing. 
 
The brake 
 
In order to prevent the scrolls from a reverse orbital movement when shutting down 
scroll compressors include a brake. The brake is made out of steel though there is a plastic 
piece which is the one that bears the friction with the wall of the housing. It works like a cam 
follower, it follows the crank pin in its movement but blocks the reverse rotation. 
 
 
Fig. 13. Picture of the brake. 
 
After this previous strip, new cuts in the packing were necessary to know more about 
the bearing housing and the shaft. In this occasion the supporting piece and the shaft were 
extracted. The rotor from the electrical motor is firmly fixed to the shaft so they cannot be 
easily separated. Both counterweights are fixed to the rotor.  
 
The bearing housing 
 
This is the most interesting piece of the compressor, where all the modifications could 
be done. This steel piece was fixed in the compressor by four pressure points in the 
packaging. All of the holes are machined to host the bearing, the orbiting scroll, the brake and  
the shaft. This part is fixed to the upper scroll by four bolts.

Fig. 14. Bearing house. 
 
The shaft 
 
The piece is made out of steel in a turning machine. It has got an eccentric crank pin 
on one side to transfer the movement to the orbiting scroll. One of the most remarkable 
features of it is the hole inside the shaft that acts as the main artery of the lubrication circuit. 
By this eccentric hole, when the shaft is turning, the oil goes from the lower part of the 
machine up to the bearing housing.  
 
 
Fig. 15. Shaft. 
 
The electrical motor 
 
The electrical motor drives the orbiting scroll member by a suitable drive shaft. The 
rotor is pressed in the crankshaft and the stator is placed in the packaging and fixed by a non-
supporting piece to the packing. The electrical motor is an AC asynchronous motor and works 
at 50-60 Hz achieving 2900-3500 rpm. 
 
The counterweights 
 
The inertial forces created by the orbiting scroll member, the brake and the eccentric 
pin of the shaft can easily be compensated by counterweights in the shaft. In this case to 
reduce the possible vibrations of the shaft there is a couple of counterweights. Both are fixed 
to the rotor of the electrical engine. One is fixed to the top of it and the other to the lower part 
so a softer distribution of eccentric forces is created on the shaft.

6. POSSIBLE SOURCES OF NOISE 
 
One of the main advantages of the scroll compressor is that it is more silent than other 
displacement compressors in the market that are commonly used for the same tasks. The 
scroll members are rotating and therefore can be completely compensated in noise and 
vibration unlike the piston compressors. 
The following chapter analyses from a dynamic point of view possible sources of 
vibration. This includes the gas forces, the orbiting pieces, the shaft, the Oldham coupling and 
the special case of increasing noise when the compressor shuts off.  
 
6.1 Gas forces 
 
The gas forces that the pockets create are equilibrated in pairs as the pockets are 
symmetrically opposed so they produce minimum vibration. Some noise  can be produced 
because of the leakage or irregularities on the walls. 
The gas enters in the scrolls through two anti-symmetric openings and fills equally 
sized pockets as shown in figure 7. There is always an even number of pockets. For this kind 
of compressor with 3 turns spirals (6Π degrees), the pockets are two or four plus the 
discharging one. Maximum standstill pressure has been chosen for the calculation and 
refrigerating gas is assumed to be R410A. A homogeneous axial pressure distribution has 
been assumed in the crescent-shaped pockets; this means that all the changes in pressure are 
due to the rolling movement of the spirals. 
Considering an even distribution of pressure inside every pocket and the process as 
thermodynamically reversible, the pressure in the gaps has been calculated and confirms the 
hypothesis of pairs of pockets situated anti-symmetrically and equal pressurized. 
Figure 18 presents the pressure evolution inside a gas pocket, from the moment it is 
formed from an outside pressure of 15 bar, to the moment the gas is released trough the mid 
opening of the fixed scroll.

Once the pressure distribution has been calculated we can determine the forces that 
these gas gaps apply on the vanes. As demonstrated before, the pressure in the compressor is 
equal in anti-symmetric gaps. This means that the forces will be the same in both spirals but 
opposed in direction, so we can calculate just the forces applied on one of the vanes and 
therefore obtain the ones in the other vane.

The graph, in figure 19, shows the force module evolution in one of the spirals related 
to the rotation angle (alpha). The changes in magnitude of F are small but not negligible. The 
change in slope at around 90º indicates the closing of the two external pockets; this means the 
increment from two to four gaps in the compressor. The rough top is the last angle (210º) for 
which the compressor has four pockets and changes again into two.  
The direction of the forces has also been investigated. Figure 20 shows the direction of 
the forces with growing alpha. The forces in the spiral go from –90º to 90º when alpha 
increases from 0º to 180º. At 90º, the force jumps to –90º and grows again to 90º when alpha 
grows from 180º to 360º.

From the discussion above there is one thing that should be understood. Due to the 
design of the scrolls, the forces that the gases create on one spiral are anti-symmetric to the 
ones created in the other. As the scrolls are in continuous contact the forces eliminate

themselves so they are equilibrated. The variation in the direction of the forces in one of the 
scrolls from 90º to –90º degrees, is compensated with and opposite variation from 270º to 90º 
on the other scroll. 
The forces have been calculated for unit of length, when taking in account the 
thickness of the vanes (3 cm) we are able to see that the order of the forces created by the gas 
is 10-2 Newton. Even when there can be variations due to the leakage and roughness in first 
operations of the scroll compressor, these forces are very small to create a high sound 
pressure level. 
The calculations for this subchapter were done with MatLab. The code of the program 
is shown in Appendix A. 
 
6.2 Orbiting pieces 
 
During operation the orbiting scroll, the thrust bearing, the drive shaft pin and the 
brake behave like a mass rotating around the shaft. Like in piston engines the inertial forces 
can be compensated by simply placing counterweights that equals the inertial movement of 
these pieces. 
While stripping down the machine two counterweights have been found. An upper one 
situated at 180º degrees of the pin close to the main bearing housing and another one placed in 
the lower part. Both are attached to the rotor of the electrical engine. The upper one is almost 
two times bigger than the lower one. It suggests that the second one is used to create a smooth 
distribution of stresses in the crankshaft.  
The centrifugal forces created by these elements depend on the velocity of the shaft:

                                                (6.1) 
e being the eccentricity. 
Rotation may begin around the shaft axis but at one speed the centrifugal forces will 
equal the deflecting forces on the shaft. At this point the shaft will vibrate violently. This 
speed is termed the critical speed. Above critical speed a smooth running state of equilibrium 
is achieved. The purpose of the following calculations is to find out whether the shaft is 
rotating around the critical speed to diminish the shaft as the main cause of vibration. 
To calculate the critical speed the maximal deflections (ymax) should be calculated for 
both cases 3500-2900 rpm. 
The following formula would be used to calculate the critical speed:

A simulation in ANSYS Workbench has been done to check on the maximum 
deflection of the shaft for both the cases with 3500 rpm and 2900 rpm. To simulate the 
centrifugal forces effect on the shaft, all the pieces are represented in the model (figure 21). 
To stand for the ensemble orbiting scroll-brake, a solid piece has been attached to the shaft 
crank pin.

Fig. 21. The model for ANSYS. 
 
The figure below shows the deformation for the first case. 
 
 
Fig. 22. Deformation for an angular speed of 3500 rpm. 
 
From the simulation in ANSYS a maximal deformation of 2.054 10–4 cm is obtained. 
With this value, by substitution in (6.2) the critical speed would be:  
20932.5
cn
rpm
=
 
So the shaft is definitely far away from the critical speed, which means it is not 
producing a sensible vibration at all. 
And for the case with 2900 rpm, shown below in figure 23, the maximal deformation 
is 1.443 10–4 cm, that gives a critical speed of 24974 rpm, which is higher than the one before.  
The values obtained for the critical speed are far way for the operation values 
therefore the shaft produces no substantial vibration.

6.3 Oldham coupling  
 
The Oldham coupling does not seem to be balanced at all. The counterweights take in 
account the movement of the moving scroll, the eccentric pin of the shaft and the brake but 
they cannot possibly take in account the movement of the Oldham coupling. The Oldham 
coupling describes a linear movement, perpendicular to the shaft, that corresponds to an 
oscillating linear movement. My assumption is that this piece has not been equilibrated and 
may be a main source of noise. 
 
 
Fig. 24. Sketch of the movement of the Oldham coupling respective to the shaft rotation. 
 
This piece made of aluminium allows the orbital movement between scrolls. Several 
solutions were created to prevent self-rotation of the orbiting scroll, but this one is most 
common at the present time. The problem of this piece is that it cannot be equilibrated by 
means of counterweights because its movement is not gyratory but oscillatory in the

24
perpendicular direction of the shaft as figure 24 shows above. The amplitude of the created 
force by this movement depends on the angular velocity of the electric engine, in other terms 
of the current frequency (60-50 Hz). For a frequency of 60 Hz, the engine moves at 
approximately 3500 rpm which corresponds to an amplitude of 65,9 N whereas for a 
frequency of 50 Hz and 2900 rpm it decreases to 45,3 N. These forces are hundred times 
bigger than the forces created by the gas pockets inside the compressor and their frequencies 
are twice the angular speed.

6.4 Power interruption 
 
There is an increment of the noise when stopping the machine. The brake makes the 
scroll and itself move its relative position to the counterweight a few degrees so the machine 
is suddenly totally unbalanced. While the counterweights and the crankpin-brake-orbiting 
scroll centrifugal forces were situated in the same plane, the vibrations were non-substantial 
as shown in the subchapter 6.2. 
During the movement as shown in figure 26.1, the flat surface drags the brake. When 
stopping, the crank pin slows down, but the brake, due to the inertial forces, continues to turn 
(26.2) until a certain angle is reached. 
 
 
Fig. 26. Effect of the stop in the relative position of brake and crank pin. 
 
 
DYNAMIC ANALYSIS OF A SCROLL COMPRESSOR 
___________________________________________________________ 
 
25
 
At the same time, when this angle is reached, the friction element of the brake is 
pressed between the wall of the bearing house and the orbiting scroll. This helps the smooth 
switch off of the machine. The noise that occurs during the stopping process is due to the 
displacement in angle that the inertial forces suffer. While both counterweights are still 
producing centrifugal forces centred in the same plane, the position of the ensemble brake-
orbiting scroll has rotated. This rotation creates force momentums that bend the shaft with 
high frequencies and produce high noise.

7. POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS  
 
After the discussion in chapter 6 it is obvious that the biggest collaborator in producing 
noise is the unbalanced Oldham coupling. The aluminium ring oscillates on a straight line 
contained in a perpendicular plane to the rotation axle. The idea is to create another mass that 
produces the opposite forces to the ones of the Oldham coupling. When studying the rings 
movement the solution that traditional mechanics give is an attached oscillating mass. The 
isolated system tends to be in equilibrium and will try that the centre of mass stays at the 
original position.  
The demands for a solution are: 
 
• Compensate Oldham coupling’s movement 
• Follow a fixed trajectory  
• Absorb disturbances in the first operations 
• Fit in the actual packing 
• Require little modifications in the actual components  
• Allow easy machine’s assembly  
  
 
7.1 Free pendulum solutions 
 
One of the physical solutions is a pendulum fixed to an oscillating platform; this 
platform would be the ring. Let us consider the external horizontal forces are null so the mass 
centre would not move if it initially were at rest. We can consider that at rest the pendulum is 
situated at the equilibrium position, so its vertical projection meets the mass centre of the 
platform. This can be called the origin O and it’s the position of the mass centre of the 
isolated system. 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 27. Schema of a pendulum fixed to an 
oscillating platform. 
 
• The pendulum is moved from the 
equilibrium an angle θ0.  
 
• The position of the mass centre of 
the platform is xb.  
 
• The position of the particle with 
mass m is xp = xb + l sin θ.  
 
• The position of the mass centre is 
Xc=O.

platform’s mass centre as function of the pendulum characteristics.

where πRb is the amplitude of the Oldham coupling oscillation, Rb being the radius 
of the base circle (see figure 5) and n the rotating velocity in rpm. 
The equations will help to choose the right relationships mass-length for different 
locations.  The oscillating platform would be the Oldham ring whose characteristics are the 
following: 
 
• 
Rb= 0.00215 m 
• 
πRb= 0.00675 m 
• 
M= 0.07270 kg 
 
The first intuitional solution for equilibrating the system is placing two little 
pendulums symmetrically.  For the sake of the balance the right placing would be to set 
them in the horizontal plane but there is no physical space to make them symmetrical on 
the compressor due to the electricity box on one of the walls. This involves that the 
solution in the horizontal plane would create bending moments and therefore vibration. 
Then we can think to place two little arms on the sides of the Oldham coupling and hang 
two masses from it like figure 28 shows.

From the space available we should be able to decide the lengths of the hanging 
arms and then the mass. In this case the oscillating arm should be constrained in a space no 
bigger than 0.015 m (l cosθ <0.015 m).

This solution will require two masses of 0.02974 kg jointed to two metal arms of 
25 mm length and they will oscillate up to a maximal angle of 53.13 deg. If these masses 
where spheres made of steel (7800 kg/m3), the radius of one would be r =9.67 mm. 
The main problem of this solution is that it is not placed in the same plane where 
the inertial forces from the movement of the Oldham coupling are. This could be another 
source of vibration because there are high probabilities of the mass centres not to be 
aligned. 
The next thought is to hang the masses from the ends placed on the line of 
oscillation as figure 29 shows. At these points the space available is much bigger so we 
can be more creative, but let us focus on the previous case. The oscillating arm should be 
constrained in a space no bigger than 0.02 m (l cosθ <0.02 m).

The size of the weights to be attached  to the pendulums are too big in both cases. 
In order to accomplish the requirement of a constrained space, the weights should be 
manufactured in heavier materials instead of steel.  
 
7.2 Oscillating mass solution 
 
The previous solutions accomplish the mathematical equations but are not valid 
from a mechanical point of view. A good solution craves physical restrictions. The 
equilibrating solution should not be free but have its movement restricted. The Copeland 
scroll compressor has been continuously developed during the last 20 years. It has a great 
compacity, which does not give possibilities for easy modification.  
Another solution is to attach an oscillating mass to the Oldham ring by two resorts 
that act in the same vertical plane where the ring oscillates. The idea is to create a pair of 
slots in the external cylinder of the top-bearing house. The new slots are the fixed 
trajectory for a pair of flat planks. These plaques should be coupled to the Oldham ring 
with two arms that should be able to present low resistance when moving in the outside 
direction, and resistance enough to be pulled by the Oldham ring when moving towards the 
inside.

Torsion resorts can fulfil these demands. This kind of resorts should transfer almost 
no strength when stress in one direction and lots of strength when moving in the opposite 
one. 
A schema on how could be torsion resorts be used for this solution is in figure 31. 
 
Fig. 31. Schema of the possible situation of the torsion resorts. 
 
If the torsion resorts are already under torsion, it would be easier for them to move 
in the direction that opens them than in the direction that strains them more. This solution 
is difficult to picture in mind; torsion resorts are not so easy to model and they involve 
angular magnitudes, etc. However this leads us to the next solution. Instead of complicated 
torsion resorts, plain resorts can be used. The Oldham ring can be enlarged with a pair of 
vertical arms and these ones can be attached to a mass by a pair of resorts. The figure 32 
clarifies the solution. 
 
 
Fig. 32. Schema of a solution with traction resorts. 
 
When the system is at rest, the centre of mass of the system lies in Xc=0. Let us 
take the origin of positive displacement when moving to the right. The Oldham ring is 
supposed to have mass m1 and the balancing mass would be m2. Let us say the resorts are 
equal and their elastic constant is K. 
When the Oldham ring is moved to the position x1 we want the balancing mass to 
move on the other direction. The centre of mass, assuming the resorts’ masses negligible, 
would be then situated in:

Applying the Newton’s second law, the resort on the left gets compressed so it will 
create a force to the right on the balancing mass; the resort on the right is enlarged so it 
will create also a recuperation force to the right on the balancing mass.

the frequency and the elastic constant of the resort. From equation (7.20), once the elastic

small channels are created on it to lubricate, and as a result, refrigerate the pieces. These 
holes will communicate with the hydrodynamical bearing house so the delivery of oil is 
secure.

The solution has been thought to enable an easy assembly in the production. The 
sliders will be joined with two tubes by means of bolts as figure 34 shows.

At last, the Oldham ring will gain two arms that will be placed parallel to the flat 
faces of the tubes. Between these faces the traction resorts will be placed. The figures 35, 
36, 37 clarify the description above.

Once the resorts are chosen, the elastic constant will be specified. Substituting this 
in the equation (7.20) the oscillating mass can be determined. From this moment, it is easy 
to play with the materials for the sliders and tubes, or with the design of the bolts, which 
could be hollowed or solid. 
 
7.3 Balancing with an anti symmetric eccentrical movement 
 
Another idea is to add another eccentric piece in the same shaft and add a twin 
Oldham coupling that accomplishes the equation:

                                                                   (6.21) 
This means that if the eccentricity of this body is lower, the mass has to be 
increased. As before, one of the problems is that the scroll compressor has been 
developing for long time and it is already a very compact machine. Introducing an 
eccentrical solution that takes in account manufacturing and assembling is difficult. What 
it is suggested here is to enlarge the crankshaft 15 more millimetres and build a twin 
eccentric device. The lower bearing is more or less a solid piece of steel attached to the 
bottom of the compressors shell so its surface can be modified. An Oldham coupling 
similar to the one on the top and an orbiting piece should be created. Due to the difficult 
assembly the orbiting piece it should be manufactured in two pieces. 
The following figure shows the opposite cut out that the shaft would present in this 
plus 15 mm. The eccentricity is placed in the other direction so the oscillating masses will 
have 180º phase.

The orbiting piece, as commented before, will be manufactured in two parts and bolted 
afterwards.

The Oldham coupling has the sliding pins in top face for the orbiting piece and in the 
bottom face with the low bearing.

The drawing from the oscillating solution and the eccentric solution are enclosed in 
Appendix B. This solutions are not final but suggestions about the possibilities to place a 
balancing assembly. 
 
7.4 Damping  
 
Intuitive solution for the mechanical engineer when speaking about vibration is to 
propose damping. The vibration of the Oldham ring could be damped. The internal 
cylindrical surface of the bearing house could be covered by a rubber layer or the slots of 
the stationary scroll could be closed and have some spring inside.  
But damping inside the compressor does not seem a good solution if high 
efficiency has to be maintained. The main disadvantages of damping are: 
 
• Damping transforms the vibration energy. It does not disappear. 
• It creates losses in an efficient machine. 
• The dampers could create forces opposite directions to the self-sealing forces of 
the compressor and increase the leakage.

8. DISCUSSION 
 
The previous chapter contains all the possible ideas that have come up during the 
process. They are all solutions to the existing problem but none of them fulfils all the 
requirements. Depending on the needs of the scroll manufacturer, one or another could be 
chosen to be developed. 
 
8.1 The pendulum solutions 
  
These solutions fulfil the mathematical requirements so in theory they could 
equilibrate the system totally. However, the solution that suggests placing the pendulums in 
the same vertical plane where the Oldham rings oscillates will be the one discussed here, as 
the bending moment is kept in one plane. 
The formulas say that the weights attached to these pendulums are quite high. A 
heavy material should be chosen for the pendulum balls so they fit in the small space they 
should be into. 
The main disadvantage of this solution is that the pendulums will move freely, it is 
not a mechanical fixed path what they follow. A fixed geometry leaves nothing at random. 
At the same time, if we consider the system with the Oldham coupling and the 
pendulums isolated, once the Oldham coupling starts to oscillate, the pendulums will move to 
replace the mass centre into its original position. This means that minimal disturbances could 
be absorbed by differences in direction or amplitude of the pendulums’ trajectories. 
 
8.2 The oscillating mass solution  
 
This design has a fixed geometry but it is also autobalanced. In case of disturbances 
the resorts can absorb the differences and the whole system will try to keep the centre of 
mass in its original position. As this solution is also placed close in the vertical direction to 
the oscillating Oldham coupling, the bending moment created is not extremely high. 
The disadvantages with this design could be the fatigue that the arms of the Oldham 
coupling will suffer during working and the existence of lubrication problems. As the bearing 
and bearing house are perforated to get oil supply to the sliders, the lubrication system is 
suffering some changes that could lead to a deficient oil supply, causing high frictions in 
other parts of the compressor. 
 
8.3 The eccentric solution 
 
By adding a twin movement but antysymmetrical in the same shaft we create another 
Oldham ring, which oscillates at the same frequency with 180º phase. It is also a fixed path 
solution, which gains points for the mechanical point of view but implies that it is not able of 
absorbing disturbances. 
Other disadvantages of this solution will be complicated assembling and a quite high 
bending moments as the twin eccentric will be placed at the bottom of the shaft (more or less 
20 cm).

According to the table, the best solution would be to design a twin eccentric device, 
which could be placed in the bottom of the machine. The table could is subjective in the way 
that it shows relevant features for the designs but not all of them. Costs and others have not 
been included in this report, as it was not its purpose, but future studies could include them.

9. CONCLUSION 
 
The purpose of this master thesis was to study the scroll compressor in order to find 
an irregularity in its design which could explain the substantial sound pressure level. After 
diminishing other causes of sound, the report shows that the Oldham coupling’s movement is 
not balanced.  
A few solution proposals are also given. By simply enlarging around 15 cm the shaft, 
a twin eccentric solution could be placed. It would balance the Oldham coupling’s movement 
and therefore reduce the sound pressure level. With the reduction of noise, equipments like 
Air Conditioning or Heating Pump systems using the modified and more silent compressors, 
would be more appreciated for domestic use.
