Sammanfattning 
Långtidsbehandling med ventilator utan tillräcklig befuktning kan torka ut en patients luftvägar 
med olika komplikationer som följd. Målet för detta examensarbete var att utveckla en ny teknik 
för att befukta och värma inandningsgasen. Ett fungerande koncept och en prototyp som styrker 
konceptet skulle tas fram. 
 
Marknaden för befuktare studerades och de vanligast använda befuktningsmetoderna granskades 
för att hitta svagheter som behövde åtgärdas. De två vanligaste befuktartyperna är Heated 
Humidifier och Heat and Moisture Exchanger. Den främsta nackdelen med Heated Humidifier 
var dess tendens att övermätta luften med kondensutfällning som följd, och med Heat and 
Moisture Exhanger att inte tillräckliga fukt- och temperaturnivåer nåddes. 
 
Därför togs en ny design fram med målet att kunna styra fukt och temperatur oberoende av 
varandra. MATLAB och Simulink från The MathWorks användes för att modellera systemet. 
Komponenter såsom sensorer för temperatur och fukt, värmare och befuktare utvärderades för 
prototypen. För fukt- och temperaturmätning valdes standardsensorer medan värmaren var av 
egen design. Nebulisatorn för fuktgenereringen hämtades från en hembefuktare. Styrsystemet 
och användargränssnittet utvecklades i National Instruments LabView.  
 
Arbetet resulterade i en fungerande prototyp bestående av befuktare, slangsystem och sensorer. 
Oberoende styrning av temperatur och fuktighet uppnåddes även om en koppling mellan dessa 
storheter var tydlig under övergångsförlopp. Godtagbara fysiologiska förhållanden nåddes utan 
kondensutfällning i slangarna. Byte av nebulisatorn, förbättring av regleringen och en metod för 
att upptäcka kondens är några av förbättringsförslagen.

Abstract 
Long term treatment with mechanical ventilation without proper humidification can dry a 
patient’s airways which causes various complications. The aim of this Master’s thesis was to 
develop a new technique to humidify and heat the inspired gas. The scope was limited to the 
design of a new working concept and the creation of a prototype as proof-of-concept. 
 
The ventilator humidifier market was studied, and the most prevalent humidification techniques 
used today were assessed to identify the weaknesses that needed to be addressed. The two most 
common designs for humidification were found to be the Heated Humidifier and the Heat and 
Moisture Exchanger. The Heated Humidifier tended to oversaturate the inspired gas which led to 
condensation in tubing, while the passive Heat and Moisture Exchanger could not deliver 
sufficient amounts of heat or moisture. 
 
Therefore, a design for actively controlling both heat and moisture delivery independently 
through feedback control was created. MATLAB and Simulink from The MathWorks were used 
to model the system and assess its feasibility. Various components for the prototype were 
evaluated such as temperature and humidity sensors, heaters, and humidifiers. The choice of 
sensors ultimately fell on off-the-shelf products while a custom heating solution was created. A 
nebulizer unit extracted from a consumer grade room humidifier was used for moisture delivery. 
The user interface and the control system were created on a computer using LabView from 
National Instruments. 
 
A functional prototype including humidifier, tubing, and sensors was developed. Independent 
control of temperature and humidity was successfully attained, though the interdependence of the 
two variables was not completely eliminated during transitions. Acceptable physiological 
conditions were achieved without tube condensation. Changing the nebulizer, improving system 
control and developing a condensation detection method are some of the suggested 
improvements.

1 Introduction and Overview 
This chapter provides a background to the problem that is dealt with in this Master’s thesis 
together with a more detailed problem statement and requirements specification. 
1.1 The Authors 
This thesis is written by two Master’s students from the mechatronics specialization at the Royal 
Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.  
 
Christian Larsson 
Enrolled in Mechanical engineering program 2004. 
 
Studies have been focused on hardware design and medicine 
 
technology. 
David Yang 
Enrolled in Vehicle Engineering program 2003. 
 
Studies have been focused on control and medicine technology. 
 
1.2 Maquet Critical Care 
This Master’s thesis is a co-operation between academia and the industry. The work was 
commissioned by Maquet Critical Care (MCC), and was carried out on site at MCC’s office in 
Stockholm, Sweden. MCC is a division of Maquet which, in turn, is part of the Getinge Group, 
one of the worlds leading suppliers of medical equipment with a turnover amounting to 16 
billion SEK for the fiscal year of 2007. Maquet consists of three divisions: Surgical Workplaces, 
with equipment such as operation tables, lights etc; Cardiovascular, with instruments and 
equipment for cardiac and vascular surgery; Critical Care, with products for mechanical 
ventilation and anesthesia.  
MCC is most famous for the Servo-i ventilator that has set a new standard in mechanical 
ventilation.  
1.3 Background 
There are many potential causes for a patient’s need for breathing assistance. The patients 
themselves range from the tiniest premature infants weighing half a kilogram to fully grown 
adults of great stature. This means the patients’ needs vary greatly and makes it impossible to 
treat all patients with one universal ventilation program, which in turn places very high demands 
on the ventilator. The Servo-i ventilator can be equipped with various software and hardware 
packages to accommodate all classes of patients.  
When a patient undergoes invasive mechanical ventilation the patient’s natural means of 
humidifying and heating the inspired air is bypassed by the endotracheal tube (ETT). This 
quickly becomes a problem as the patient is cooled and dried by the dry inspiration gases 
(compressed air usually mixed with oxygen). A patient that is kept on invasive mechanical 
ventilation for longer periods will invariably develop complications to the airways, and thus, a 
system for humidifying and heating the inspiration gas is needed. Such systems do exist today, 
but they exhibit some interesting shortcomings. The advantages and disadvantages of these 
systems will be discussed in Chapter 2.4. 
1.4 Problem Statement and Aim 
There are already a number of humidification devices available on the ventilator market. All of 
these devices use a variation of one of mainly two fundamentally different technical solutions. 
Both of these solutions come with unique drawbacks. Heat and moisture exchangers have limited

heating and humidification capabilities, and also increase the work-of-breathing (WOB) for the 
patient. Heated humidifiers on the other hand tend to over saturate the inspiration gas to the point 
of condensation, which can drown the patient and also promotes bacterial colonization in the 
tubes. 
The aim of this Master’s thesis is to design a new solution that can be integrated into an ongoing 
research project at MCC (regrettably, the details of this project cannot be disclosed here at the 
time of writing for reasons of the proprietary nature of the technology and patent reasons). Focus 
lies on designing a robust humidification concept and building a working prototype to prove its 
feasibility. 
The thesis work can be divided into the following three segments 
• Survey of the market 
o What technical solutions are available on the market today? 
o The clinical research frontier 
• Choose a method for humidification that addresses the following problems 
o Heating of the inspiration gases 
o Adding humidity to the inspiration gases 
o Measuring temperature and humidity 
o Avoiding condensation in respiration tubes 
• Build a functional prototype 
o Choice of sensors, actuators, development environment etc 
o Designing mechanics, electronics, and logic 
 
The ventilator humidification market shall be studied, and the existing designs shall be assessed. 
The existing products’ advantages and drawbacks shall be identified. The clinical research 
frontier shall be surveyed. This knowledge shall be used when creating the new humidification 
design which is to address the problems in existing designs. The last stage of the thesis is to build 
a prototype of the new solution. 
1.5 Method 
Following is the method that will be used for solving the problem stated above. The method was 
decided on during the first weeks of the Master’s Thesis and might be subject to change.  
1. Performing a background study. The study’s focus is the physiology of the problem (why 
is humidity needed?) and today’s market (what solutions are there today?). This is to 
understand what is needed by the concept. 
2. Producing a general system model. A theoretical model of a humidification system to 
better understand the thermodynamics of the system.  
3. Developing and testing mock-ups in parallel with point 2, to see what technical solutions 
seem promising. 
4. Decide the most promising concept and start an iterative process of making a prototype. 
5. In parallel with point 4, model the specific system and a controller. 
6. The development process is completed with a period of verification and calibration of both 
prototype and controller.

1.6 Delimitations 
As previously stated, the top priority is to develop a working solution. The exact design of the 
prototype and the choice of hardware and components are less critical. The prototype is not 
expected to be ready for mass production. All performance-limiting aspects of the prototype 
shall be discussed, and suggestions for possible improvements shall be provided. These 
suggestions may be realized in the event that additional time is given, but it is neither obligatory 
nor prioritized.

1.8 Test Specifications  
A few tests were designed with the patient’s comfort and safety in mind as this development 
process aims at creating a prototype for a medical product. The tests are summarized here and 
the test protocols with complete descriptions are attached in Appendix A.

room temperature ~22 °C). The maximum allowed deviation in temperature is 1 °C at steady 
state. Accepted overshoot in temperature and humidity is 2 °C and 5 mg H2O/L gas. 
2. Rapid changes of reference settings for both humidity and temperature shall be tested. 
Maximum accepted overshoot in temperature is 1 °C and in humidity 5 mg H2O/L gas. 
Maximum settling time is 15 minutes. 
3. The outer conditions (gas flow and breathing tube cooling) shall be altered during operation 
to test that temperature and humidity does not deviate too much. 
All tests shall be performed using an external calibrated temperature and humidity sensor that 
can be compared to the values presented by the prototype. 
1.9 Distribution of Work 
Most of the work on this thesis was conducted jointly by the two authors, but for reasons of 
school policy and overall efficiency, some of the responsibilities were divided among the authors. 
Roughly speaking, the background studies were a joint effort while designing of the technical 
solution and the prototype realization were carried out independently according to each student’s 
responsibilities. David’s primary responsibilities were system modeling and control. Christian’s 
primary responsibilities were hardware and electronics design. Though each student was given 
distinct areas of work, it must be noted that the two students continuously communicated each 
other’s progresses, and regularly aided one another to overcome hurdles. All major decisions 
were also made together as a team. 
The distribution of work will be most apparent in Chapter 4 according to each student’s 
responsibilities. Chapters 4.1 and 4.4 are mainly the work of David, while Chapters 4.2 and 4.3 
are primarily written by Christian.

2 Background Studies 
This chapter covers the background study that was done prior to deciding a concept and 
developing that. The aim is to provide a basic understanding of the application, physiology, 
physics and sensors as well as actuators.  
2.1 Basic Ventilator Theory 
Chapter 2.1 aims to provide the reader with a basic understanding of the application that the 
developed prototype is intended for.  
2.1.1 Mechanical Ventilation 
Mechanical ventilation is used for patients who have difficulties maintaining adequate 
ventilation. The first ventilators were Negative Pressure Ventilators, creating a negative pressure 
outside the chest and thereby expanding the lungs and helping the patient to inhale. The Positive 
Pressure Ventilators have however been dominating since the middle of the 20th century. An 
oxygen/air gas mixture is provided to the patient at a set pressure. A sealing between gas tube 
and patient’s airways are needed to avoid leakage. This can be provided using an ETT inserted 
into the patient’s upper airways and sealed with an inflatable cuff. This is called invasive 
ventilation. 
There is also Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV) often performed using a mask strapped over the 
mouth and nose or nasal prongs or tube inserted via the nose. Non-invasive ventilation is 
common on conscious patients who can breathe spontaneously. 
2.1.2 The Maquet Servo-i and NAVA 
The Servo-i ventilator from Maquet is the latest in the Servo-series of ventilators, following the 
successful Servo 900 and Servo 300. A Servo-i, see Figure 1, with full software package can 
ventilate patients ranging from prenatal children to grown adults.  
 
 
Figure 1. The Maquet 
Servo-i ventilator.  
 
Figure 2. Illustration of a ventilator’s basic components.  
 
 
A positive pressure ventilator, such as the Servo-i, generally consists of three valves to provide 
the basic functionality. Two valves mix the inspiration gas to the patient, controlling 
inspirational pressure. The third valve controls expiration pressure, see Figure 2.

David Yang 
 
A ventilator with the basic components as in Figure 2 can ventilate patients in many different 
ways (ventilation modes).  One such mode worth mentioning is the Continuous Positive Airway 
Pressure (CPAP) mode where the ventilator provides a flow of gas to maintain a specified 
pressure. This aids the patient in keeping an elevated pressure in the airways to open them.  
 
The pressurized gases are supplied through gas outlets in the hospital walls if available, 
otherwise using gas tubes or a compressor for the air. The gases are considered dry.  
 
Neurally Adjusted Ventilation Assist (NAVA) is the latest module added to the Servo-i. It allows 
the ventilation to be controlled by the patient’s neural signals from the respiratory center to the 
diaphragm, read by a series of electrodes on a tube in the esophagus.  
2.2 Physiology 
A basic understanding of the physiology of breathing and the human airways was sought. This to 
provide a deeper understanding of the need for humidification and warming of the gas, as well as 
the consequences for suboptimal levels of both humidity and temperature.  
The fundamental concept for active humidification in intensive care is that the patient’s mouth 
and nose is bypassed by an ETT, disrupting the function of the body’s natural humidification and 
warming of inspiration gases. 
2.2.1 Optimal Conditions 
The authors of several articles agree on that the optimal conditions for inspired gas delivered to 
an intubated patient is at body core temperature (~37 °C) and fully saturated (100% RH 
translating to 44 mg H2O/L gas at 37 °C) [1, 2, 3]. “Inspired gas at body temperature and 
saturated is thermodynamically neutral to the intubated airway, and thus may be considered the 
optimal condition for ventilation lasting more than a few hours”, Ryan [1].  
2.2.2 Physiological Complications – Overhumidification  
The physiological effects caused by exposure to humidity levels higher than the saturation point 
in core temperature gas are not well studied. Delivering higher levels of water in molecular form 
(vapor) requires an increased gas temperature, causing thermal injury before overhydration. A 
suggested maximum airway mucosa temperature is 43 – 45 °C, Williams [3]. Increased water 
content without increased temperature is however possible using humidifiers creating an aerosol 
where the water can remain in liquid phase as droplets. This causes the risk of flooding the 
alveoli (drowning the patient) decreasing the alveolar-arterial oxygen exchange rate. Other 
possible complications mentioned in Williams [3] are osmotic challenges to mucosal cell 
function because of changed saline concentration, decreased vital function and compliance 
among others.  
Aerosol humidifiers have much in common with the nebulizers creating a mist of liquid 
medicine that a patient can inhale. A study has been performed, Harvey [5], on the lung deposits 
of an aerosol, showing that large deposits occur in the upper airways depending on particle size. 
This can be related to the problems of overhydration using an aerosol humidifier. 
2.2.3 Physiological Complications – Underhumidification  
While overhydration is less common, underhumidification is more frequently occurring as a 
result of insufficient humidification of dry inspiration gases. It has therefore been more 
extensively studied. Lower humidity levels cause water and heat loss in the airways. The heat 
loss consists of 1) heating the inspired air if air temperature is lower than body core temperature

and 2) vaporizing water supplied by airway. The second being the most important as the 
vaporization energy of water is much higher than the latent heat of air.  
ETT occlusion is the most critical complication related to moisture loss, Tobin [4] (also a risk 
when overhydration occur, Williams [3]). This is a very critical condition which can require 
urgent replacement of ETT. Other mentioned complications are increased airway resistance, 
decreased compliance, loss of cilia function and cilia destruction. 
A suggested lower limit on AH that a humidifier should deliver is 30 mg H2O/L gas, Tobin [4]. 
2.3 Physics 
2.3.1 The Physics of Humid Air 
In order to design a controlled system for air humidification, an understanding of the involved 
thermodynamics is needed. The most important calculations are the heating of air, heating of 
water, vaporization of water, heating of vapor and the gas mixtures.  
To begin with, air needs to be defined. Most hospitals are equipped with outlets for compressed 
air and oxygen on the walls. The compressed air comes from a large central compressor, and the 
oxygen is supplied from pressurized containers. In case a central compressor is unavailable, it is 
possible to connect a portable compressor to the ventilator.

Dry air consists of 78.09% N2, 20.95% O2, 0.93% Ar and small amounts of CO2, H2, Ne, He and

Measures of Humidity

Humidity (RH) and Absolute Humidity (AH). They are defined as follows:

Relative humidity is the most commonly used measurement of humidity in daily situations. It is 
defined as the partial pressure of water divided by the saturation vapor pressure at that specific 
temperature, given in percent. The saturation vapor pressure varies with both temperature and 
total pressure of the gas. As a consequence, one particular AH level can correspond to different 
RH levels depending on the circumstances.  
For the sake of calculations, the compressed air shall be assumed to be 20 °C and 10% RH when 
decompressed.

To simplify the calculations, the required energy to properly humidify the inspiration gas is 
approximated as the sum of energy needed to raise the water temperature from 20 °C to 100 °C, 
vaporization energy of said water at 100 °C, and heating of dry air from 20 °C to 37 °C. 
Specific Heat and Enthalpy 
Enthalpy is used when calculating the amount of energy needed to raise or lower the temperature 
of a substance. The specific heat capacity (also known as specific heat) is a measure of energy 
capacity per unit mass, and can be defined for either processes under constant pressure,

constant volume

The Vaporization of Water 
When the temperature of water is raised to 100 °C water’s partial pressure reaches one 
atmosphere. The atmospheric pressure can no longer keep the water in liquid form and any 
additional energy supplied will be used to evaporate the water. This process will continue until 
all the liquid water has transitioned to a gaseous state. The heat of vaporization of water, 
0r [J/g], 
is dependent on temperature and pressure. However, since vaporization is assumed to take place 
at 100° and 1 atmosphere’s pressure in these calculations, 
0r  is assumed to be 2256 J/g, Dean 
[6]. Therefore, the energy requirement to heat water from 20 °C to 100 °C is

2.3.2 Heat and Mass Transport 
The core problem of this Master’s Thesis is a matter of heating a fluid and adding water to it. In 
order to determine the heat exchange and mass transport between for example a heater and a 
passing fluid, fluid dynamics must be studied. Fluid dynamics is a complex field of studies. 
Problems must be very strictly defined in order to safely compare one set of results against 
another. But when it is used consistently, it can prove to be a very powerful tool to determine 
whether one solution is more promising than another.  
Heat Transfer Due to Conduction 
There will always be diffusion between a wet surface and the surrounding air unless the air is 
saturated with water already. This will give a mass transport of water at the same time as the 
water is vaporized giving a heat loss for the surface. The heat transfer from the surface can be 
calculated as

Heat Transfer Due to Convection 
For the calculation of heat transfer due to convection it is assumed that the mass transport comes 
from the turbulent mixing of air close to the surface. This gives that an amount of dry air 
switches place with air that is saturated with vapor and has reached the temperature of the wet 
surface. According to Ekroth [7] the heat exchange can be calculated as

Assuming the peak temperature never exceeds 400K and the hot surface’s area is in the order of 
magnitude of 10-3m, the radiation component’s order of magnitude should be 100 W. Therefore 
the radiation’s contribution to heat transfer will be neglected. 
Total Heat Transfer 
Consequently, summing Equations (2.9) and (2.10) gives the total heat transfer rate

With Equation (2.13) and (2.14) inserted into (2.12) the total heat transfer rate can be found, the

c
α . 
Calculation of the Heat Transfer Coefficient 
It is when calculating 
c
α  that the most critical assumptions have to be made. As will be shown, 
c
α  is based on three dimensionless quantities. According to Ekroth [7]

α  can be found using 
the following equation

α  is obviously based on the Nusselt number, +u, the thermal conductivity of the medium, λ , 
and a characteristic length, L. The characteristic length can for example be the diameter of the 
tube that the medium flows through. It is however hard to find a good definition of the 
characteristic length, most important is that it is defined in the same way all times when doing 
comparisons. The Nusselt number is in turn based on the two other dimensionless numbers, 
Reynolds and Prandtl, as

which can be calculated knowing fluid-specific data, the fluid’s velocity and the characteristic

2.4 Existing Technologies to Humidify Air 
There are today two commonly practiced techniques for humidification of inspiration gas to a 
patient undergoing mechanical ventilation. These are the Heated Humidifier (HH) and the Heat 
and Moisture Exchanger (HME) described below. 
2.4.1 Heated Humidifier 
A HH is an active humidifier and works like a heated pass-over humidifier. It is basically a 
hotplate with a cup of water on it. Fisher & Paykel is one of the largest manufacturers in the 
market; their MR730 is shown in Figure 3. 
 
 
Figure 3. The Fisher & Paykel MR730 heated humidifier. 
 
The dry inspiration gas is passed through the humidification chamber (passing close the heated 
water surface). Temperature and humidity is controlled by the temperature of the water buffer 
and, if available, the control signal to a heated inspiration tube from HH to patient. Feedback 
control is achieved using a temperature sensor in the tubes close to the patient.  
A higher temperature than 37 °C is needed in the humidification chamber to achieve 37 °C at the 
end of the patient tubing. The air in the humidification chamber becomes close to saturated at 
that higher temperature and contains more water than possible at 37 °C, causing condensation in 
the patient tubes as the gas cools down. This is the biggest disadvantage with HHs as water traps

David Yang 
have to be used and maintained. However, reaching the desired 37 °C and 100% RH is not a 
problem using a HH. 
2.4.2 Heat and Moisture Exchanger 
A HME is a passive humidifier and works by recycling the energy and moisture of the patient’s 
exhaled gas back to the patient on inhalation. This effect is achieved by using a filter in the 
ventilator tubing close to the patient’s mouth, see Figure 4. The filter will act as a buffer for heat 
and water exhaled by the patient.  
 
 
Figure 4. The Maquet Servo Humidifier 162. 
 
The inspiration gas will always have a lower temperature and less absolute humidity than the 
exhaled air. This is due to heat loss to the surroundings and that not all exhaled water is trapped 
by the filter.  
It is impossible to reach the desired 37 °C and 100% RH with a HME but it is still a widely 
practiced solution. This is first and foremost due to the simplicity of a passive humidifier. A 
HME is regularly changed with 24- or 48-hour intervals of ventilator treatment due to filter 
degradation and the problem of bacterial colonization of the filter. Other disadvantages worth 
mentioning are the pressure drop caused by the filter, the added dead-space and that the filter has 
to be placed close to the patient adding weight to the tubing.  
2.4.3 Active Heat and Moisture Exchanger 
Combining the advantages of the HME and the HH described above gives an active HME 
(aHME). There are a number of aHMEs commercially available but none has yet become widely 
adapted in hospitals despite their very promising results [9, 10]. There are different designs but 
one worth mentioning is the Humid-Heat® system from Louis Gibeck1. It works like a HME 
positioned close to the patient but with active water supply and a heating element in the filter. 
This makes it possible to reach 100% RH and 37 °C without the problem of condensation in the 
tubes. Another interesting concept is the HME Booster® from Inspiration Medical2. 
2.4.4 Other Industries  
Ultrasonic nebulization of water is used for humidification and cooling of indoor environments 
(server halls for example) as well as atomizing of liquid medicine for inhalation. The cooling 
effect is caused by the small droplets of water quickly starting to evaporate in the surrounding 
air, lowering the temperature and increasing humidity. The main difference between nebulizer 
units intended for different uses are often transducer size and numbers, further explained in 
Chapter 2.6.1.

2.5 Sensor Technology  
2.5.1 Temperature Sensors 
Platinum Resistance Thermometers (pRT) 
Resistance thermometers are temperature sensors utilizing that the resistance through a metal 
changes with temperature. Platinum is the most common metal used because of its linear relation 
between temperature and resistance and its chemical inertness. Other metals such as Nickel are 
also available but with a lower maximum temperature rating. The platinum elements are 
commonly rated up to 660 °C.  
The most common pRT sensors in industry is the pt100 (pt for platinum) with a nominal 
resistance of 100 Ω at 0 °C (also available with nominal resistance of 0.5, 1, 10 kΩ and more). 
The change in resistance with temperature for the pt100 is 0.385 Ω/°C.  
One way to manufacture these elements is using a thin layer of platinum on a substrate plate. The 
desired nominal resistance is achieved through laser trimming a platinum path that goes back and 
forth on the plate. The platinum is then covered to protect from mechanical and chemical 
damage.  
A current must run through the sensor to measure the resistance which gives raise to the problem 
of self-heating. Choosing a low current (typ. <1 mA) for measurement minimizes this problem.  
Thermistors 
Thermistors have many properties in common with the pRT as both have a temperature 
dependent resistance. There are basically two types of thermistors, the PTC and the NTC 
(Positive or Negative Temperature Coefficient). The PTC’s resistance increases with increasing 
temperature and the NTC’s decreases. Unlike the pRTs the thermistors can be made of ceramics 
or polymers instead of metals and they have a non linear relation between temperature and 
resistance. Some thermistors can however exhibit close to linear behavior over smaller 
temperature ranges and a high accuracy is possible in that range. Other thermistors can exhibit 
closer to a switching behavior (sudden increase of resistance at a specific temperature) which can 
be attractive in for example heating elements that are design to maintain a specific temperature. 
Thermocouples 
A very common temperature sensor in the industry is the thermocouple as the sensor is cheap 
and interchangeable. It is intended for applications with a wider temperature range than the 
pRTs, thermocouples can for example measure in the range -270 to 1370 °C (type K) [11] but 
with an uncertainty higher than 1 °C. The sensor utilizes that two metals in junction creates a 
voltage difference between them that varies with temperature. The voltage difference depends on 
the metals and is very small (tens of µV/°C), some metal junctions are standardized into 
thermocouple types.  
The measurement device is however more complex than for pRTs because the need for Cold 
Junction Compensation (CJC).

David Yang 
 
Figure 5. A common thermocouple circuit with cold junction compensation. 
 
Since the voltage measured, Vout in Figure 5, is related to the difference in temperature between 
the hot and cold junction and not the absolute temperature; knowledge of the cold junction 
temperature is needed. That is often measured using a thermistor or pRT. The uncertainty in 
measuring the cold junction temperature together with the thermocouple’s unlinear behavior 
makes it difficult to reach tolerances better than 1 °C.  
2.5.2 Humidity Sensors 
Capacitive Humidity Sensors 
A capacitive humidity sensor is built like a regular capacitor with two electrodes and a dielectric, 
commonly a polymer or oxide metal [12]. The electrode subjected to measured gas is 
transmissive to water vapor that can enter the dielectric and change the dielectrical constant, ε. 
As the capacitance of an ideal parallel plate capacitor is 
 
d
A
C
⋅
= ε
 
(2.20) 
where A is the area of the plates and d the distance between them, the capacitance increases with 
increasing dielectrical constant.  
The capacitance of available industrial sensors is in the range of a few hundred pF over the 
whole humidity range. The small capacitances introduce problems with wiring lengths when 
measuring; the sensors have to be calibrated for the specific application. There are numbers of 
ways to read the capacitance value from the sensor; one is to apply a pulsed voltage and the 
sensor will act as a filter, the capacitance is found from the voltage over the sensor.  
The capacitive humidity sensors are the most commonly available humidity sensors and they are 
often combined with sensor IC’s on the same substrate. These IC’s are calibrated with the sensor 
and can for example give a voltage that is linear to relative humidity as output. 
Resistive Humidity Sensors 
Also the resistive humidity sensors utilize that the electrical characteristics of a hygroscopic 
medium changes with the relative humidity it is subjected to. The resistive humidity sensors have 
resistance in the range of 1 k – 100 MΩ and they exhibit an exponential relation between 
humidity and resistance. As the hygroscopic medium absorbs the water vapor ionic functional 
groups are disassociated and the electrical conductivity of the sensor increases. 
An advantage of the resistive humidity sensors are their interchangeability that are higher than 
with capacitive humidity sensors. 
2.5.3 Water Level Sensor 
There are various methods for measuring a liquids presence or level, from a float controlling a 
mechanical switch to measuring the distance to a liquid surface using ultrasound.

One especially interesting technique utilizes the difference in refraction index for air and water, 
see Figure 6 for an illustration of such a unit.  
 
 
Figure 6. Schematic drawing of a liquid level sensor. 
 
The light emitted from the LED is reflected twice by the sensor dome when no liquid is present 
on the outside of the dome. But some amount of the emitted light is refracted when liquid is 
present because of a different refractive index of the dome boundary. When the photo-transistor 
receives less light than a certain threshold the output signal is changed, indicating that a liquid is 
present. These sensors require no maintenance or adjustments when installed at the desired liquid 
level.  
2.6 Actuator Technologies 
The actuators in a system like this are of two types: 1) heat actuators converting electrical energy 
to thermal and 2) humidity actuators creating a water aerosol from water and electrical energy. 
The first type needs no closer explanation as it generally, and in the prototype, consists of a 
resistance with a high current passed through it. The second type is more interesting and a basic 
understanding of its principle is provided here. 
2.6.1 Humidity Actuators 
Creation of an aerosol can be done in many ways; one common way in nebulizers for industrial 
and home appliance use as well as nebulizers for medical use is the ultrasonic nebulizer, 
schematically shown in Figure 7.

The piezo crystal in Figure 7 is part of the ultrasonic transducer creating the oscillations in the 
water bath. Because of the nature of a piezo material (explained shortly below) oscillations 
related to input voltage frequency and amplitude will propagate through the water from the 
oscillator plate. The oscillations are in the ultrasonic spectrum (above 20 kHz, usually ~1.7 
MHz).  The water is unable to follow these high frequency oscillations because of its high 
inertia, causing small water droplets (as small as 1 µm) to be torn off the water surface. The 
droplet size varies but only the smaller droplets can follow passing air.  
Brief Explanation of the Piezo Effect 
The piezo effect is exhibited by some materials with crystal structures. These materials give rise 
to an electric potential when mechanical stress is applied and vice versa giving a mechanical 
displacement as a reaction to electrical potential. Both of these effects are used in ultrasonic 
transducers. The materials are electrically neutral when no stress is applied, the charges are 
symmetrically distributed and that symmetry is disrupted as the materials shape is changed, 
causing the electrical potential.

3 Ideas for Final Solution 
This chapter covers the work with deciding on a humidification concept done prior to the 
development process. After the decision followed a period of evaluation and testing of separate 
modules which is shortly described. 
3.1 The Different Concepts 
There has been no shortage of ideas in the search for the optimal way to humidify the inspiration 
gas. The main difficulty was making the right compromise regarding the complexity of the 
concept, the production cost and development time, without accurate knowledge of the 
determinants.  
A list of concepts and their advantages and disadvantages was made and one concept was chosen 
to be developed further. This concept is described below. However, the list of other concepts has 
been omitted due to proprietary reasons.  
3.1.1 Determining Factors 
The most important factors to consider when choosing concept are described here. 
• Safety for patient/operator. Safety is always highest priority, especially in a medical 
product. A patient hovering between life and death cannot be subjected to too high 
temperatures or humidity levels. Factors such as surface temperatures of tubes etc must be 
considered for the safety of both operator and patient. 
• Complexity. A low system complexity is always preferable as long as the system fulfills the 
specifications.  
• Component cost. This is usually not an important factor in developing prototypes, but with 
the goal to make this part of a product it has to be considered. Standard components are 
favored. 
• 0ecessary development time. The Master’s Thesis is limited in time to 20 weeks, giving 
that it’s not possible to dive deep down in all technical subjects. Commercial Off-The-Shelf 
(COTS) solutions have to be used in some cases to save time. 
• Single-use versus multiple-use. All parts that are in contact with the patient or can be 
contaminated by the patient must be single-use (or autoclavable) generally speaking. This 
implies that placing all actuators and sensors close to the patient might make the product very 
expensive for hospitals. Only the components that must be in the contaminated zone should 
be there. 
• Physical dimensions and weight. There are different restrictions on the physical dimensions 
depending on where the parts are placed. The most critical part is the patient tubing where 
flexibility and low weight is desired. 
3.1.2 Chosen Concept 
The choice of concept to develop further is a compromise of all factors above. The concept 
basically consists of a nebulizer and heater inside the ventilator. These produce a humidified air 
stream that is heated over target temperature and cools down in the tubing to the patient. The 
cool down allows a low RH (high temperature) in the beginning of the tube that increases closer 
to patient (lower temperature) helping in condensation avoidance.  
The choice is further motivated as follows: 
• Using a nebulizer in the ventilator gives the ability to control the absolute humidity with a 
weaker correlation to the temperature. Unlike using for example a water boiler where 
absolute humidity and temperature are strongly correlated.

• Placing the heater inside the ventilator instead of closer the patient is more secure if the unit 
malfunctions, avoiding hot surfaces close to the patient.  
• This concept would only require sensors, and no actuators, to be situated in the tubing to the 
patient, allowing flexible tubes to be used. No water or higher electrical currents has to be 
passed close to the patient.  
• Separating the water supply and heater from each other allows for testing different methods 
for both heating and water addition.  
• This concept gives the ability to completely avoid condensation in the tubes (as the humidity 
can be controlled independently of the temperature), minimizing the necessary maintenance 
for the hospital staff. 
3.2 The Modular Solution 
A modular design method was chosen for the continued work as the concept was decided. 
Designing using separate modules for different functions comes with a number of advantages. 
The ability to swap a module without having to redesign the complete prototype is the main 
advantage. The final prototype can later be designed as an integrated unit consisting of the 
different modules chosen.  
3.2.1 An Overview of the Modules 
 
Figure 8. An overview over the modules and their interaction. 
 
The objective is an air stream with controlled temperature and humidity. This is achieved using 
modules that 
• 
Add water to the air stream in form of an aerosol. 
• 
Heats the water and air mixture to create water vapor and obtain the desired temperature. 
• 
Measure temperature and humidity to give feedback data. 
The modules and their interaction are seen in Figure 8. The most important technical solutions 
that have been evaluated for these three modules are described below in Chapter 3.2.2 – 3.2.4. A 
solution for each module is chosen to be integrated into the final prototype. That solution and the 
work with implementing it can be studied in Chapter 4.

3.2.2 Modules for Heating 
The heater serves two purposes in this system: 1) Vaporizing the liquid water creating steam, 2) 
Heating the gas mixture to approximately 37 °C at the patient. This is done in the ventilator 
because of the amount of energy needed for converting water to steam. Three heaters were 
evaluated and those are described shortly in this chapter.  
Heater From a Heat Gun 
A COTS air heater from a Leister3 heat gun was used to quickly test the idea. The heat element 
had high ratings (450 W at 230 V) for the application where roughly 100 W was desired even 
though it was the weakest heat gun available. A phase controlled power regulator (model PAC-
24) from United Automation was used to control the system.  
The Leister heater proved very efficient for the task thanks to its low thermal mass (ceramic 
housing) and that its heater wires are exposed to the air stream. The high power rating made it 
difficult to control the end temperature. 
Aluminum Heater with Cartridge Heating Element 
This heater module consisted of a round aluminum piece with drilled holes for the air stream as 
well as a Rotfil5 cartridge heater. It was designed to resemble the Leister heater but with a more 
suitable power rating. Aluminum was chosen for its good thermal conductivity which however 
lead to problems with melting of the surrounding plastic tube. The heater was more easily 
controlled with the PAC-2 than the Leister since the Rotfil element was rated at 110 W at 230 V. 
An advantage was the more accurate temperature control, but the Leister-heater had a more 
efficient heat transfer to the passing air and a lower risk of melting surrounding plastic tube. 
Heater Made of Heating Wires and Plastic Housing 
The final heater design was a combination of the advantages of the two previous tested, see 
Figure 9. A grid of heating wires in the air stream held firmly in position by a plastic housing 
combined the advantages of a low thermal mass with a low power rating. Choosing the heater 
wire and its length made it possible to achieve a suitable power rating at low voltages.

This heater module was chosen for the final prototype, it is further described in Chapter 4.2.2 
and 4.2.3. 
3.2.3 Modules for Aerosol Generation 
The purpose of this module is to create an aerosol consisting of water particles small enough to 
follow the air stream. The phase transition from water to vapor is achieved by the heater. Two 
factors were important in the choice of aerosol generator: 1) droplet size (small size is desirable) 
and 2) ability to accurately control the amount of generated aerosol. 
The Injector Solution 
Fuel injection in combustion engines creates a mist through pressurizing the liquid and spraying 
it through a nozzle. The same principle was evaluated for this purpose. A circuit built around the 
LM19496 from National Semiconductor powered an injector from a car engine. The injector was 
controlled with Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and fed with water pressurized to 2 bars. Visual 
inspection of the created mist gave the conclusion that the water droplets were too big to be 
carried by the air stream instead of ending on the tubing walls. A risk of fluctuating humidity in 
the resulting air stream was seen as a result of the low control signal frequency needed. Feeding 
the injector with higher water pressure would create smaller droplets but increase the complexity 
of the system. Using an injector would however provide a solution with good accuracy of added 
water. 
Ultrasonic Nebulizer  
A basic understanding of the ultrasonic nebulizer is provided in Chapter 2.6.1. This technique is 
used at MCC to deliver drugs as an aerosol to patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. It is 
also found in industrial and home appliance nebulizers which’s purposes are to humidify air. A 
home appliance humidifier (the Bionaire7 BU1300W) was used as a donor of transducer and 
driving circuitry (seen in Figure 10) to achieve the desired amounts of nebulized water per unit 
time. The stochastic behavior of the nebulizer resulted however in difficulties controlling the 
amount of nebulized liquid. Tests showed that the nebulizer performance depended on the water 
level above the transducer (highest performance with water level approximately 20 mm above 
transducer). This is probably because of the ultrasonic transducer having a focus point at a 
specific distance. Control of water level was therefore necessary.

This solution was chosen to the final prototype for its low complexity, its long-term stability and 
simple electrical interface. 
Micropump/Nebulizer 
This technique is used by the company Aerogen8 in their nebulizer series Aeroneb. Unlike the 
ultrasonic nebulizer described above with the liquid buffer and mist on the same side of 
transducer, the micropump separates the mist from the liquid. The pump utilizes a fine-meshed 
net that oscillates with 100 kHz in contact with the liquid, according to Aerogen [13]. The high 
inertia of the water causes it to be pushed through the net and an aerosol consisting of very small 
droplets is created. A degradation of performance after time was noticed when testing the 
micropumps. This in combination with their low performance (2-3 elements would be needed) 
favored other solutions. The uniform and small droplet size in the mist is however very 
interesting.  
3.2.4 Temperature and Humidity Sensors  
Temperature and humidity are the two quantities that needs to be measured. Humidity is often 
measured in RH but knowing the temperature in the same spot makes it possible to calculate the 
AH. Important factors for both sensors are the rise times and for the humidity sensors the ability 
to fast recovery from condensation. 
Units with Sensors for Both Temperature and Humidity 
The Sensirion SHT11 
The SHT11 module from Sensirion9 has both temperature and humidity sensors and returns the 
results through a custom digital interface. The module seemed promising, especially as there 
were ready circuits to read the digital data developed at MCC. It did however prove to have long 
rise times and it took long time for the unit to recover when condensation had occurred.  
 
The IST LinPicco A05 
The LinPicco A05 module (see Figure 11) from IST10 measures RH and returns an analog 
voltage signal well suited to the chosen development environment (see Chapter 4.3.1). Its 
physical dimensions are greater than those of the SHT11 but having the RH-sensor directly 
exposed to surrounding air makes it react faster to changes and it recovers faster from 
condensation. The LinPicco also has a pt1000-element on the circuit board but with no signal 
conditioning. An amplification circuit to read the temperature was designed but the sensor’s rise 
time was too long, likely caused by the high thermal mass of the circuit board. The LinPicco A05 
was chosen as RH-sensor for the final prototype.  
 
A problem with all commercially available RH sensors that were found was their low accuracy. 
Especially at the two extremes 0 and 100% RH. The LinPicco is for example rated at < 3% RH 
accuracy between 15 – 85% RH, and undefined accuracy outside that range. This made it 
impossible to measure close to the heater or patient as the RH is very low/high at those positions.  
Temperature Sensors 
Other pt1000 elements can be used with the amplification circuit designed to read the value of 
the LinPicco pt1000 element. Shorter rise times were desired, the rise time of such an element is 
mostly dependent on its mass.

The MiniSens pt1000-element, see Figure 11, from IST is part of the platinum thin-film 
temperature sensor family. Measuring 1.6x1.2mm in size is it one of the smallest pt1000-
elements available, giving very fast rise times.

4 Implementation 
This chapter covers the theoretical and practical work done to create the proof-of-concept 
prototype for the humidification technique developed in the previous chapter.  
4.1 Modeling and Control 
Chapter 4.1 treats the development of the theoretical modeling of the system and the controller 
design. 
4.1.1 System Modeling 
A system model was created in Simulink to simulate the dynamics of the system when creating 
the controller. All the details regarding the system modeling, such as theory and modeling 
process are presented in this chapter. The modeling is built upon several basic assumptions and 
approximations in order to keep the complexity at a reasonable level. Each simplification will be 
presented and justified in the following subsections.

Subsystems 
The system model was initially created in several subsystems, representing the different logical 
modules that the whole system is comprised of. These are the heater subsystem, tube subsystem, 
and the water supplier subsystem. 
Heater Subsystem 
The heater subsystem represents the heating module of the humidifier, regulating the final 
inspiration temperature delivered to the patient. The heater is also responsible for vaporizing the 
incoming water. 
Assumptions and Simplifications 
The system is represented as a control volume inside a hollow cylinder (see Figure 12). This 
control volume consists of a constant gas volume 
0
=
c
V&
, and a heating coil with a known 
constant mass 
( )

. Additionally, the control volume has boundaries in the form of the 
walls of the cylinder, made of a material that has a low thermal conductivity 
ck , and two abstract 
boundaries at the inlet and outlet respectively. This control volume is called the heating chamber, 
or chamber. The specific heat capacities of the gas, heating coil, and chamber walls are assumed 
to be constant with no variations due to temperature,

There are four ways for energy to enter, alternatively leave the chamber. These are the chamber’s 
inlet, outlet, heating coil, and chamber walls. Energy transport at the inlet and outlet is primarily 
a result of mass transport. Energy transport at the heating coil and the chamber walls is due to 
temperature gradients, which result in conduction and convection. The heat transfer coefficient 
c
α  for convection is the same as the one established in Chapter 2.3. Further assumptions are 
made as follows.  
The heating coil is assumed to have an insignificant length in the flow axis, where gas that 
passes the heating coil immediately reaches final temperature.  
 
 
This final gas temperature is then assumed to be preserved to the outlet. The chamber walls are 
assumed to create a linear temperature gradient in the radial direction from the chamber’s center. 
The outside of the heating chamber is assumed to maintain ambient temperature. All water 
supplied to the heater system comes from the water supplier subsystem and is assumed to attach 
itself to the heating coil, where the energy exchange due to temperature differences is assumed to 
be instantaneous. Water from the heater can only exit by evaporation. The water evaporating 
from the heating coil is assumed to leave the coil at the same temperature as the heating coil.

This process can then be represented as two differential Equations, (4.3) and (4.4), with the 
dimensions [J/s]. Thus, steady state implies a dynamic equilibrium of energy entering and 
leaving the system. 
 
The power balance of the heating coil can thus be written as follows.

Water Supplier Subsystem 
The water supplier subsystem is the module where the water enters the air stream. The water is 
supplied by a nebulizer in the form of small droplets. The water supplier is located upstream 
relative to the heater subsystem. Consequently, the water supplier will affect the initial 
conditions for the heater. Modeling and simulation of the droplets have been performed based on 
Hallbäck [14].  
The difference in vapor concentration close to the drop’s surface and the surrounding gas will 
promote evaporation. The energy needed will be taken from the drop which is subsequently 
cooled. Figure 13 and Figure 14 show the simulation results for initial conditions

Figure 13 clearly shows a rapid drop in temperature for the water. However, the heating coil in 
the heater subsystem represents a greater thermal mass than the water drops, and thus the cooling 
for the water and heater combined is small. Also, the low temperature gradient between the water 
drop and surrounding gas means the amount of vapor transported to the gas during this short 
time is very limited. Furthermore, since the real distance between the nebulizer and heater is very 
short, the process is likely to be shorter than the simulated 0.2 seconds. Therefore, the cooling 
and evaporation effects of the water supplier shall hereon be neglected, and the water supplier 
subsystem will be described simply as a function whose output is the water input to the heater 
subsystem.

The left hand side of Equation (4.9) is the energy change rate in a tube segment’s control 
volume; the first term on the right hand side is the energy flow rate into the segment by gas flow; 
the second terms is the energy flow rate out of the segment due to gas flow; the third term is the 
energy loss to the tubing due to convection. Equation (4.10) is the power balance for the tube 
material. The first term on the right hand side is identical to the convective term in Equation 
(4.9), but has the opposite sign, meaning the heat loss due to convection in the air stream is a 
heat gain term in the tube material. The second convective term in Equation (4.10) is the tube’s 
heat loss due to the tube’s interaction with the surroundings.

Complete System 
The complete system is a combination of the three subsystems described above: the water 
supplier subsystem, the heater subsystem, and the tube subsystem in that order. The water 
supplier’s solution enters the heater as input, and the heater’s solution in turn is fed into the tube 
subsystem. The state variables for the whole system are the outputs from the tube subsystem. 
The final system was modeled in Simulink11. The variable-step ode45 (Dormand-Prince) solver 
was used with a relative tolerance of 
5
10−. The step responses for the model clearly reveal the 
higher order nature of the system (a step in control signal does not produce an immediate change 
in the derivative of the output).   
                                                 
11 Zero crossing control had to be globally disabled for the model primarily due to problems with mass transport 
when the calculated vaporization rate was greater than the actual water supply rate.

4.1.2 Controller Design 
The original model is highly nonlinear with discontinuities, and is fairly complex and 
cumbersome in its entirety. Therefore, a linear time-invariant 2x2 Multiple-Input, Multiple-
Output (MIMO) transfer matrix G was created to decently approximate the system in its most 
likely range of operation as a starting point when designing the controller.

The operating envelope is assumed to be in the temperature range 35 °C – 39 °C and humidity 
range 20 – 40 mg H2O/L gas. Input 1 is the heater and input 2 is water supply. Output 1 is the 
heated gas temperature, and output 2 is the gas humidity level. Figure 16 shows a sample 
comparison between the Simulink model’s step response and the transfer matrix. The two step 
responses are significantly different. Nevertheless, it is roughly speaking the best second order 
approximation possible.

The gas temperature in the model was observed to have a higher-order relationship to the system 
inputs. For simplicity, this has been approximated as two second order transfer functions for the 
first row of transfer matrix G in Equation (4.11). The gain k0 has a positive sign while k1 is 
negative. Supplying power to the heater will increase the temperature whereas supplying water 
will lower the temperature. Although the temperature plays a very large role in the vaporization 
process, the heater’s relationship to humidity output has been omitted in this model, since the 
water supplied is assumed to be fully vaporized after passing the heater when running within the 
operating envelope. The humidity to humidifier relationship is approximated as a first order 
transfer function. The complete humidifier system has a significant thermal mass which makes 
the temperature response sluggish. The nebulizer unit on the other hand has little inertia and can 
thus quickly ramp up the rate of water mist creation. Furthermore, the time for the mist to travel 
from the nebulizer to the patient is significantly shorter than the system’s temperature rise times. 
This is reflected in the poles of the different elements of the transfer matrix.

The plant G in Equation (4.11) is not diagonal. Testing a simple decentralized controller with 
input 1 paired with output 1, and input 2 paired with output 2, does unfortunately not produce 
satisfactory performance since the variable interactions are too pronounced. It is therefore 
necessary to use more elaborate methods. Static decoupling was the chosen design approach. 
Decoupled control is a regularly used method for controlling MIMO systems, and one of the first 
methods taught in multi-variable control engineering classes. It can be found in most books on 
multi-variable control, such as Chapter 8.3 in Glad [15].  
 
First, the plant G was redesigned with a pre-compensator W1 in order to attain an as diagonal as

4.2 Prototype Design – Mechanics 
The focus of this Master’s thesis was not to design and build the perfect prototype in mechanical 
aspects. But it was necessary to design a prototype that was robust and could demonstrate the 
working principle of the concept. This chapter describes the work done with the mechanical 
design, from the first mockup to the finished prototype. 
4.2.1 The Early Designs 
The first designs were all fast mockups made for testing different concepts. Some of the 
evaluated modules can be seen in Chapter 3 describing different modules for heating, water mist 
generation etc. All parts during the mockup stadium of development were built of parts found in 
the MCC laboratory. The only parts designed using CAD software were a heater and a plastic 
tube for positioning the sensors in the air stream.   
 
 
Figure 17. An early mockup. Testing the 230v heater. 
 
Figure 17 shows one of the early mockups made to understand the heat exchange between the 
heater and an air flow. It used a 230v heater from a heat air gun (described in Chapter 3.2.2).  
4.2.2 Design Using CAD-Software 
A prototype specially designed for the chosen solution was needed when it had been verified to 
work using mockups. Some sketches were made on paper to be able to discuss the design and 
avoid obvious mistakes when designing in CAD. Figure 18 shows the prototype from the side 
cut in half, the small arrows indicate airflow.

Figure 18. A sketch of the final prototype. 
 
The key factors when deciding on this design was: Robustness and simplicity to build in the 
workshop. There were no time for waiting on production of the prototype and no failures such as 
dimensioning too weak etc could be accepted. This prototype roughly consists of two plastics 
parts, one aluminum part plus a number of smaller details.  
 
The CAD software Solid Edge v20 by UGS12 was chosen for it being well known to the students. 
The parts that were to be used in the prototype and which design was already given was mainly 
the ultrasonic nebulizer (see Figure 10) and the standard breathing tube connectors. These were 
modeled as parts in Solid Edge to be used in an assembly view to see that everything fitted. One 
factor that limited the design was the available material in the workshop at Maquet. The design 
was adapted to this in order to avoid waiting for material deliveries.  
 
 
Figure 19. The prototype’s two main parts, heater pipe and water container. 
 
The heater pipe (left in Figure 19) is where the air mixed with water mist passes through the 
heater. The water becomes vaporized by the hot heater wires and the gas mixture is heated. 
Having the heater pipe vertical allows excessive water droplets to return to the water buffer 
below. The heater’s power cable is routed through a hole in the vertical wall; a set screw pushes

it towards the inner wall. A cutout in the bottom of the heater pipe allows fitting a net that stops 
the larger droplets from reaching the heater causing oscillations in gas humidity content.  
 
The largest part is the water container (right in Figure 19) that holds the nebulizer. The bottom is 
designed to be compatible with the nebulizer chosen, deciding the diameter of the largest cutout 
and the bolt pattern. The two smaller vertical cutouts are for gas inlet and water level 
surveillance as well as water refilling. A horizontal pipe connects the cutouts making the water 
level even in all cutouts.  
 
The other parts that were designed in CAD are mentioned below: 
• Heater. See Figure 9 in Chapter 3.2.2. The idea was to make a skeleton holding a net of 
heating wires. The challenge was fitting enough length of heating wire while not risking the 
strength of the material. An o-ring was used for sealing to the inner wall of the heater pipe, 
preventing air and water to pass outside the heater.  
• Water level plug. A plastic plug was made to fit in the middle hole in the water unit. This 
plug holds the water level sensor and a nozzle for water refilling. 
• Base plate. A thick aluminum plate was made as a base for the prototype. 
 
Below are pictures of the prototype as a complete rendered assembly (Figure 20) and as it came 
from the workshop (Figure 21): 
 
 
Figure 20. Rendered assembly from CAD.  
 
Figure 21. Prototype delivered from workshop. 
 
The differences in design seen between Figure 20 and 21 is that the water unit from the 
workshop has rounded edges instead of sharp corners as in the model. This is because of the 
limited availability of materials. That part was made out of a 90 mm diameter plastic bar.  
Drawings to all parts that were made in the workshop can be found in Appendix B. 
4.2.3 Choice of Materials 
There are a number of important factors to consider when choosing materials, for instance cost, 
difficulty to manufacture, resistance to temperature, resistance to chemicals, electrical and 
thermal conductivity and their medical classification. The materials being approved to use in 
medical equipment would have been more important if this was a prototype closer to production.  
 
The most critical requirements on the materials are that some of the parts are exposed to high 
temperatures, especially the heater as the heater wires can reach ~200 °C. The gas mixture 
 
Humidification of Inspiration

leaving the heater pipe can be ~90 °C with high absolute humidity. The parts positioned before 
the heater (the water unit, drop stop net and water level plug) are not exposed to high 
temperatures. The manufacturing challenges, the mechanical strength and the price were more 
important for those components.  
 
The heater is a skeleton holding the heater wires as described in the previous section. The idea is 
exposing the heater wires to the air stream as much as possible but every turn of the wires has to 
pass through the skeleton walls. These wires can easily reach temperatures in the range of 150 – 
200 °C during normal operating conditions. A metal would have been the primary choice for the 
skeleton unless it hade short circuited the heater wires. A plastic was therefore sought (ceramics 
would have been well suited but costly and difficult to manufacture). A plastic capable of 
handling over 200 °C without loosing its mechanical properties is PEEK (Polyetheretherketone). 
The PEEK is an expensive plastic but it has extraordinary characteristics such as a higher glass 
transition temperature at 275 °C and a melting point at 340 °C13.  
 
The other plastic parts of the prototype (mainly the heater pipe and water unit) were made of 
PMMA (poly(methyl methacrylate)) for three reasons: Optical properties, availability in 
workshop and simplicity to manufacture. It was doubtful whether PMMA would work as 
material in the heater pipe because of its low melting temperature of 100 °C [16]. Earlier 
experiments had shown that the gas mixture leaving the heater could reach 90 °C. PMMA was 
tested, being the most suited plastic available. No visible effects were found after hours of 
testing. Manufacturing the bigger parts in PMMA has another advantage; the whole prototype 
becomes transparent making it possible to see what happens inside. This has proven very 
valuable when evaluating the prototype. 
4.3 Prototype Design – Electronics 
Designing the electronics in the mockups and prototypes has been an important part of this 
Master’s thesis. Conditioning of both measured signals and control signals were the central 
objectives.  
4.3.1 Choice of Development Environment 
The first idea was to make an electronics solution containing a microprocessor gathering 
measurement data and calculating control signals. This would have been interesting and 
instructive but time expensive. To get started quickly, regardless the final solution, a COTS 
system for measurement and actuation of control signals was used.  
The virtual instrumentation and testing software LabView from National Instruments14 (NI) was 
available at MCC. A DAQ (Data AQuisiton) unit was needed to make the interface between 
LabView and prototype, the chosen DAQ was a NI USB 6008. It had sufficient performance in 
terms of sampling rate and number of analog and digital inputs/outputs. The NI LabView 
combined with this DAQ can be seen as a replacement of a microcontroller. The main advantage 
with this replacement is the graphical programming. Also troubleshooting the system is 
simplified as all signals can be examined while the system is running. A disadvantage is however 
that the PC with LabView controls the speed of all measurements and control loops (signals has 
to be sampled by the DAQ, sent to the PC, controls signals calculated and sent back to the DAQ 
which actuates them) resulting in a rather slow system. Measuring an input signal and calculating 
a new control signal can take tens of milliseconds (depending on the PC) compared to a few 
milliseconds on a microcontroller.

It is possible to write code for a microcontroller based on the block diagram in LabView, giving 
better control over execution times. Such a microcontroller could later replace the LabView 
solution if desired.  
 
It was valuable for MCC to have the system in LabView to simplify integration with other 
projects as well as further development of the prototype. 
4.3.2 The Heater and its Controller 
This chapter describes the work done with the final heater and control assembly. The final heater 
can be modeled as a resistor as it consists of a net of heating wires. The heater wire used is 
Nikrothal 80 from Kanthal15 with a diameter of 0.5 mm. An idea was to use 1 mm diameter wire 
but that failed because the difficulties in bending sharp corners. Two wires of diameter 0.5 mm 
were used instead and routed next to each other. The resistance per meter for the 0.5 mm 
diameter wire is 5.55 Ω. The wires are routed forth and back through 74 holes, each stretch being 
24 mm plus a few mm in every turn. This gives a total of almost 4 meter wire (2 wires of 2 m 
length) being used. The two wires can be modeled as two resistors in parallel. Each wire having 
a resistance of

A rough estimation of maximum power needed is 100 W. The voltage needed for that power

(4.12) 
A 24 V supply capable of delivering more than 100W was provided by MCC.  
 
The next problem is to convert the LabView control signal to a power level supplied to the 
heater. The DCM24-40 from United Automation was chosen as power controller for its simple 
input signal. It controls the heater through PWM of the 24 V line. The pulse width is controlled 
by a 0-5 VDC signal that’s generated by the DAQ and LabView.  
The DCM24-40 is very similar in control to the PAC-2 230 VAC module that was used earlier 
for testing the 230 V heater modules. They differ in how they internally control the power to the 
load. The DCM24-40 uses PWM of a DC line and the PAC-2 uses phase angle control of an AC 
line.  
4.3.3 The Nebulizer and its Controller 
An ultrasonic nebulizer was chosen as the aerosol generator in the system. Left was the choice of 
ultrasonic transducer and driving circuitry. Companies working with industrial humidification 
(such as humidification of server rooms etc) had their solutions but those were made for higher 
liquid flows than this application needed. The fastest solution was to find a home appliance 
humidifier in the closest home electronics department.  
The needed amount of nebulized water per unit time was necessary to know. Air fully saturated 
with water vapor at 37 °C has an absolute humidity of 44 mg H2O/L gas. Calculating with a flow 
of 40 L air per minute would cover all operational conditions. This gives

The choice of humidifier fell on a Bionaire16 BU1300, see Figure 22, which is rated at 0.17 L 
nebulized water per hour. The humidifier had a rotary potentiometer to control the amount of 
nebulized water.  
 
 
Figure 22. The Bionaire BU1300 home appliance humidifier. 
 
Disassembling the BU1300 gave an ultrasonic transducer connected to a small circuit board, 
Figure 23, generating the high frequency signal that drives the transducer.  
 
 
Figure 23. Nebulizer circuit board modified with heatsink and optocoupler. 
 
The circuit board is powered from a transformer giving 25 VAC from 230 VAC mains. The 
alternating current is directly rectified on the circuit board and used to power the oscillation 
circuitry. The rotary potentiometer varied between 0 – 5 kΩ and seemed to be a part of the 
oscillation circuit. A way to control this resistance from LabView was needed, and all that was 
available were 0 – 5 VDC control signals.  
The solution was to use an optocoupler that consists of a LED (Light Emitting Diode) and an 
LDR (Light Dependent Resistance) molded together in a single unit. Powering the LED from 
LabView will vary the resistance of the LDR that can be connected instead of the rotary

potentiometer. The problem with these optocouplers was the nonlinearity between current 
applied to the LED and resistance of the LDR. The resistance interval of interest was 0 – 5 kΩ 
and the optocoupler (easily available) closes to this was the NSL-32SR3 from Silonex17 with a 
resistance interval of 60 Ω – 25 MΩ. The concern was whether the needed amount of water 
would be nebulized with a lowest resistance of 60 Ω instead of 0 Ω. Some tests proved that the 
performance was still enough.  
20 mA current through the LED at 5 V control signal with a voltage drop of 2.5 V through the 
LED gave the following resistor in series with the LED:

(4.14) 
The optocoupler and the 125 Ω resistance was soldered to the circuit board so it could be 
controlled using a 0 – 5 VDC signal that is galvanic isolated from the nebulizer unit. 
The Signal to the Transducer 
The inside of the BU1300, mainly the circuit board, gave an impression of low quality not built 
to last long. One of the circuit board resistors reached a temperature of over 110 °C when 
operating the humidifier as an example. It would’ve been interesting to build an oscillation 
circuit to power the transducer but that was out of the scope for this Master’s thesis. The signal 
generated by the oscillation circuit to the transducer was studied with an oscilloscope which gave 
the following conclusions: 
The signal consists of a 100 Hz (rectified 50 Hz) AC signal with 6 V amplitude when the 
controlling resistance is high (>1MΩ). A 1.7 MHz (in the ultrasonic spectrum) signal is 
superpositioned on the 100 Hz signal and the amplitude of that signal is raised as the controlling 
resistance is lowered. Running at full speed (controlling resistance about 60Ω) gives an 
amplitude of about 30 V to the transducer.  
Amplification of Control Signal 
As the NI DAQ can deliver up to 5 mA on its analog outputs a basic amplification circuit was 
needed. A voltage following amplifier being able to deliver higher currents was used. One of the

4.3.4 Electronics for Reading Measured Quantities 
The two sensor signals needing additional circuitry to be measurable were the signals from the 
two pt1000 temperature elements. The relation between temperature and element resistance is as 
follows

(4.15) 
The maximum and minimum resistance that should be measurable is needed when designing the 
measurement circuitry. A reasonable temperature range is 10 – 60 °C which in Equation (4.15) 
gives a range of resistance from 1038.5 – 1231 Ω. This is simplified to 1050 – 1250 Ω (13 - 65 
°C) when designing the amplification circuit.  
The schematic for this circuitry is seen in Figure 25 and explained below 
 
 
Figure 25. Schematic for amplification circuit. 
 
It consists of three operational amplifiers, two non-inverting with negative feedback (1 & 2) and 
one with differential amplification (3). The pt1000 element is connected to the negative feedback 
loop of the first amplifier.  
The gains of the different amplifiers are as follows:

A change in temperature of about 50 °C (difference in resistance of about 200 Ω) is transformed 
to a change in voltage of about 5 V which is suited for measuring with the NI DAQ.  
Calibration of Sensors  
No calibration of the temperature sensors would be needed in an ideal world with ideal 
components. This was not the case. A calibration was needed because of several factors such as 
• The wires and connectors add resistance to the measured pt1000 resistance. 
• The offsets of the operational amplifiers. 
• The tolerances of the resistors in the amplification circuits. 
 
It was reasonable to first calculate the resistance of the pt1000 element and then go from there to 
temperature. Inserting Equation (4.16) and (4.17) into (4.18) and solving for 
1000

The values of the resistors were measured individually and inserted into this equation to 
minimize the problem of the resistor tolerances. The actual resistance of the pt1000 elements 
including cabling was measured with a multimeter and compared with the value calculated with 
Equation (4.20). The difference was at most 4 Ω and it was compensated for using a constant.  
 
Equation (4.15) was used in LabView to go from resistance to temperature and another constant 
was introduced to compensate for small errors in temperature. The two pt1000 elements that 
were part of the prototype were put in a glass container together with two K-type sensors 
connected to a Fluke 80TK thermocouple module calibrated by MCC test division. The 
prototype’s sensors were calibrated against the K-type sensors at room temperature and the 
calibration was verified at a higher temperature as well. A maximum error of 1 °C difference 
between the pt1000 element readings and the K-type temperature sensor was tolerated. 
4.3.5 Water Refilling System 
A system for regulating the water level was necessary as the nebulizer performed best with a 
specific water level. The initial idea was to use a passive system, utilizing an air-tight box with 
refill water positioned above the humidifier, having an air inlet and water outlet. Water would 
only be able to leave the box if air entered. The air inlet would be connected to a tube ending at 
the desired water level. This would enable air to enter the box if the water level sunk below

David Yang 
desired level. The water flow from the box would be stopped as the water level increased, 
stopping the flow of air into the box. This idea was however discarded due to problems with the 
practical implementation, and that it required a special refill water box.  
 
A system using infusion bags that already are used at hospitals is more attractive. Positioning the 
bag higher than the humidifier and using a valve on the tube to the humidifier enables controlling 
the liquid flow. A soft silicon tube together with a valve that pinches the tube from the outside 
was used. Therefore the valve is never in contact with the water, and the bag and tubing can be 
of single-use and easily replaced.  
The control signal to the pinch-valve is obtained from the water level sensor described in 
Chapter 2.5.3, a LLE101000 from Honeywell19. The level sensor signal is low-pass filtered to 
avoid disturbances caused by waves from the nebulizer. The pinch-valve chosen was one found 
in the MCC laboratory, needing 24 V. This signal was given by a relay controlled by the DAQ, 
connecting the valve to the same 24 V source as the heater.  
4.4 Model – Prototype Tuning 
This chapter aims to present the process of calibrating the system model developed in Simulink 
with the physical prototype and the actual controller design process. 
4.4.1 Prototype Step Responses 
In order to determine the validity of the model described in Chapter 4.1, the prototype was 
subjected to a series of step responses. Figure 26 is a sample comparison plot between the step 
response for the model and the actual prototype. The goal was to tune the Simulink model as 
close as possible to the actual prototype to justify the use of the controller design method 
described in Chapter 4.1.2.

The model’s parameters were adjusted to fit the prototype’s step responses more closely. The 
model was ultimately deemed acceptable when the errors for the time constants and steady state 
gains for the prototype and the Simulink model were both below 5%. Consequently, the 
simplified transfer matrix ( )s

4.4.2 Controller Synthesis in MATLAB and Simulink 
The updated plant model ( )s
G
 was pre-multiplied with the new pre-compensator W1 to create 
the diagonal plant 
( )s
G~
. The controller structures were selected as a PID-controller with an 
additional low-pass filter for the first state variable, and a PI-controller for the second state 
variable. Pole placement was carried out on the diagonal system, where a well damped closed 
loop system was favored as opposed to a fast and poorly damped system. Rapid temperature and 
humidity changes were believed to have the ability to upset an intubated patient whereas slow 
changes were easier to adapt to. The gain parameters for controller ( )s
F~
 were obtained through 
solving of the Diophantine equations. 
 
The diagonal controller was then post-multiplied with W1 for use with the original plant ( )s
G
. 
After a few iterations, the closed loop poles were decided as 
01

 and 
03

 as a 
reasonable tradeoff between speed and relative damping, and resulted in the following controller.

The discretization was carried out on MATLAB R2006b with the function c2d found in the LTI 
Toolbox. 
 
Unfortunately, the controller proved to be unsatisfactory when used with the prototype. The most 
significant shortcoming of the controller was its tendency of significant sustained oscillations 
around the humidity setpoint. At its worst, the oscillations could grow to as much as ±10 mg 
H2O/L gas. Furthermore, the discretized temperature controller showed an inability to home in 
on the setpoint. The cause for these shortcomings was concluded to be inadequate modeling of 
the transfer matrix G, and numerical difficulties in MATLAB when discretizing the controller F.  
It was then decided that the final controller for the prototype would be designed manually 
directly in LabView while the controller previously designed in MATLAB would be consulted 
as a guideline for the final shape of the controller.

4.4.3 Manual Controller Tuning in LabView 
The limitations of the controller in Chapter 4.4.2 led to a change in the controller design 
approach. The following procedure was instead utilized for the final design on LabView.  
 
1. Manually tune the PID-controllers for temperature and humidity with the Ziegler-Nichols 
method separately. 
2. Design an additional decoupling controller for the system manually. Use the decoupled 
controller in Equation (4.22) as a guide for overall shape of controller. 
3. Fine-tune the original temperature and humidity controllers with the decoupling 
controller in place. 
4. Add pre-filters as needed 
 
A decoupling controller for the heater that regulates on the humidity error was created, but the 
gain for this controller was set very low to have little impact. However, an additional feed-
forward controller was added to the heater. This controller feeds a significant signal contribution 
to the heater that is dependent on the humidity setpoint. As a direct result of this, the risk of the 
heater being shut off while the nebulizer is active was greatly eliminated, decreasing the 
temperature overshoot in the negative error direction, and also guaranteeing proper vaporization 
of the mist. However, this led to a noticeable increase in the overshoot in the positive direction 
and a slower return to the reference from this overshoot. Nevertheless, this was preferred to the 
risk of heavy condensation. 
 
A first order pre-filter with time constant 
30
=
τ
 was added to the humidifier. The soft 
transitions in setpoint changes offered by the pre-filter were able to decrease the humidity 
overshoot significantly. A second order model following controller coupled with a second order 
reference pre-filter was attempted but was unsuccessful. The first order pre-filter for the 
nebulizer was added to the heater as well, but it did not have the same noticeable improvement 
as the humidity pre-filter. Naturally, this is because the dynamics of the heater differs 
significantly from the nebulizer.  
4.5 Prototype Software 
The prototype software is exclusively developed using LabView as mentioned in Chapter 4.3.1. 
The details of collecting measured data and doing simple conversions (as for converting 
temperature and humidity signals to measured values) will not be shown here as only basic linear 
conversions are used. Two other conversions are however of a higher interest: 
 
1. Calculating AH knowing temperature and RH in the same position 
2. Calculating RH knowing temperature and AH in gas stream 
 
The first conversion is needed since only temperature and RH sensors are available, and AH is 
needed for humidity control as well as the second conversion. The second’s purpose is to find the 
RH close to patient, knowing the temperature at the patient and the AH previously in the tubing.  
 
The absolute humidity can, according to  [17], be calculated as

computing.  
 
The controller runs in a timed block with 250 ms execution interval and the measurement 
routines are executed each 100 ms. This was on the limit of what the computer could do.

Figure 27. The VI’s front panel (user interface). 
 
The VI consists of a block diagram and a front panel (the user interface) as shown in Figure 27. 
The user interface is designed for easy evaluation and adjustments to the system, and it’s 
(obviously) not intended for an end-user. The upper box contains mostly the measurement plots 
(red plots are connected to sensors between patient and humidifier and calculated AH, and blue 
plots are connected to the temperature sensor close to patient and the calculated RH).  
The lower part of the user interface contains the settings for the controller and data logging. The 
control signals can also be manually adjusted for testing purposes. 
4.6 Verification of Final Prototype 
As the final prototype presented the desired behavior according to its sensors, verification by a 
calibrated and independent measurement unit was needed. That unit should be mounted to 
measure the quantities a patient would experience. MCC provided a calibrated Testo 650 unit 
with a probe for temperature and humidity measurement. The values could be compared through 
logging data with both the Testo and the NI LabView interface during a number of tests. These 
tests are described in Chapter 1.8 and the protocols along with plots are found in Appendix A. 
 
The Testo measurement probe was inserted into the end of the patient tubing and its values 
compared with the temperature sensor and calculated RH at the same position. An example plot 
from a cold-start test showing temperature data from LabView and Testo is seen in Figure 28.

The reference (black curve) is increased gradually by the preprogrammed start-up routine to 37 
°C. The LabView measured temperature can be seen approaching the reference with a maximum 
overshoot of about 1 °C. The temperature measured through LabView and Testo follows each 
other, but with an offset of about 1.1 – 1.3 °C (the Testo probe has a longer rise time, causing 
them to be correspond during heat up). There were no offset between the sensors in calm air but 
the offset occurred as soon as there was a flow of air. This effect is most likely caused by an 
unexpected self heating of the small pt1000 element causing a problem as it was calibrated in 
calm air. At this phase of prototype development it was however too late to redesign the 
measurement circuit.  
 
Both temperature and humidity were filtered using MATLAB (especially the humidity data from 
Testo needed filtering). Both filtered and unfiltered data are shown in all plots (as in Figure 28). 
The filtered data is used for measuring overshoot, settling times etc. The plots in the test 
protocols in Appendix A shows a discrepancy between the two measured RH values of about 
10% RH. This is assumed to be caused by differences between the two sensors since both are 
factory calibrated. The Testo probe seems unsuited for measuring gas streams with such high 
flow velocities in a small diameter tube, causing the severe oscillations in read values.

5 Results 
The results of this Master’s thesis can be divided into two parts. The first being the answer to the 
question of issue, finding a working humidification concept. The second is the realization of the 
first, namely the design and making of a functional prototype demonstrating the concept. 
5.1 The Concept 
This is the resulting concept in brief description, illustrated in Figure 29. A mist generator and a 
heater (vaporizer) inside ventilator, heating the gas above target temperature to compensate for 
tube cooling. A RH and temperature sensor placed where temperature is lower (measurable RH), 
used for calculating the AH for humidity feedback. Temperature feedback is provided by a 
sensor close to patient. The heat losses through tubing walls create a temperature fall used for 
avoiding condensation (keeping the tubing walls at higher temperature than gas dew point). 
 
 
Figure 29. A functional concept scheme. 
5.2 The Prototype 
A fully functional prototype capable of demonstrating the chosen concept was developed. The 
prototype performance was shown by a number of practical tests, found in Appendix A. The test 
results are given in a short summary below. 
 
• Cold start to 37 °C and 20 mg H2O/L gas is accomplished in less than 12 minutes.  
• Response to a step in humidity (20 – 35 mg H2O/L gas and vice versa) is accomplished in 
less than 5 minutes. 
• Rapid changes of gas humidity content causes temperature oscillations because of the great 
change in gas energy content. 
o Especially a rapid decrease in humidity content causes a severe temperature drop with 
following overshoot in temperature.   
• Changes in reference gas temperature have none or very little influence over absolute 
humidity level as the humidity control is a faster system than temperature control. 
 
The prototype’s behavior in all test cases can be studied in Appendix A. A test that exhibits 
important characteristics of the controller is the drop in humidity causing temperature 
oscillations. The test result is seen in Figure 30 and further explained here.

temperature. 
• Decreased heater control signal caused by reduced need of water vaporization. 
 
This decrease is followed by an overshoot in temperature caused by 
• The temperature error integral growing too large resulting in an exaggerated control signal. 
• Response from heater control signal to temperature response in end of tubing is very slow.  
 
A five hour long test was performed to evaluate rate of condensation when running the 
humidifier at acceptable physiological conditions (references were 37 °C and 35 mg H2O/L gas). 
The measured oscillations in LabView were ±0.5 °C and ±5 mg H2O/L gas. The Testo measured 
38 – 38.5 °C and 85-95% RH suggesting a AH higher than 40 mg H2O/L gas. Condensation 
occurred after one third of unheated tubing. The condensation spread remained constant (the last 
two thirds of unheated tubing) but the water droplet size seemed to increase very slowly. A 
longer test would be needed to determine whether the droplets would continue to increase or if 
equilibrium was attained.

6 Discussion and Conclusion 
6.1 Discussion 
6.1.1 Results Discussion 
A fully functional prototype capable of demonstrating the chosen concept was developed. The 
prototype’s performance indicates some interesting characteristics. These are shown by a number 
of practical tests found in Appendix A.  
Performance Requirements 
The desired conditions are, as established in Chapter 2.2, 37 °C and 44 mg H2O/L gas delivered 
to the patient’s airways. The prototype could reproduce these conditions but with unacceptable 
amounts of condensation in tubing. The reference instrument (Testo) did however report higher 
humidity and temperature levels than the prototype’s sensors, suggesting that the prototype 
delivered more humidity than what was reported by the sensors. That can in some degree explain 
the early detection of condensation. Mild condensation was detected during long term tests when 
running at 35 mg H2O/L gas (corresponds to approximately 80% RH at 37 °C). The Testo 
however reported at the same time an absolute humidity exceeding 40 mg H2O/L (slightly under 
90% RH, 37 °C). Performance in other respects, such as response times and start-up time, 
satisfied the requirements. 
Temperature and Humidity Control 
Temperature and humidity can be controlled independently on the prototype. However, it is still 
apparent that the two states affect each other. To obtain perfect decoupling, more effort is 
required on system modeling and control design. The temperature can be controlled with a 
precision of approximately ±0.5 °C. The humidity on the other hand can only be controlled to ±5 
mg H2O/L gas when the humidity reference is set to 20 mg H2O/L, and ±10 mg H2O/L for a 
reference of 40 mg H2O/L. The reason for poor humidity control performance is believed to be 
due to the inherent characteristics of the nebulizer.  
Condensation Avoidance 
There is no condensation detection method in place on the prototype. Thus condensation can and 
will form in the system if the humidity controls are not set appropriately. The prototype must be 
manually adjusted once condensation is detected. 
Avoidance of Bacterial Colonization 
Unfortunately, stress tests of sufficiently long duration have not been performed on the 
prototype. Therefore it is impossible to make any claims about bacterial colonization. However, 
the concept developed within this thesis should not be more prone to bacterial growth compared 
with a conventional ventilator without humidification added assuming condensation is avoided. 
The water container is however a source for bacterial growth and it needs to be dried and cleaned 
after being used.  
6.1.2 Prototype Discussion 
6.1.2.1 Integration with Ventilator 
The prototype is easily interfaced with any source of air flow. Unfortunately, the physical size 
does not adequately meet the physical dimensions requirements. There is however significant

Christian Larsson 
Gas in a Ventilator 
 
David Yang 
room for improvement. One of the prime candidates for improvement is the design of the water 
buffer. The big lateral protrusion of the water basin in the current design could likely be trimmed 
down to half of its current size.  
Beside the main unit that can be placed inside the ventilator, two sensor modules on the 
inspiration tube are needed to complete the machine. One module is preferably positioned close 
to the ventilator measuring temperature and relative humidity in order to calculate the absolute 
humidity. The second sensor module should be placed as close to the patient as possible to 
accurately measure the temperature of the gas supplied to the patient. Ideally, the second sensor 
should be unobtrusively embedded into the mouthpiece closest to the patient. 
 
The current prototype utilizes a heated tube from the ventilator to the first sensor module, and a 
regular non-heated breathing tube at the end. It should be possible to replace the heated tube with 
a shorter well-insulated tube to achieve similar performance characteristics. The tube exchange 
in itself will not pose a problem since the connectors conform well to the established standards in 
the ventilator market.  
 
The prototype control consists of a VI in LabView running on a PC. This VI could with minor 
modifications be redesigned as a function block with reference temperature and humidity as 
input data. In that way the humidifier control could be streamlined with a larger ventilator 
control system. 
6.1.2.2 Choice of Components and Materials 
The heater and the nebulizer are the absolutely central parts of the prototype. Other important 
parts are the temperature and humidity sensors as well as the water level sensor.  
The heater has been through the most design iterations and the final heater appears to perform 
well. However, the melting point of the PEEK plastic is a point of concern that has not been fully 
evaluated.  
Unfortunately, only one kind of nebulizer has been investigated. The random behavior of this 
nebulizer obviously encourages the search for better alternatives.  
The temperature sensors performed very well with a very short rise time (see Appendix A). In 
fact, the rise time might be unnecessary short. A sensor with longer response time would have 
the advantage of acting as a natural low-pass filter smoothing out the oscillations caused by the 
stochastic nebulization of water. 
The relative humidity sensor and its loss of accuracy close to its measurement limits is the 
primary reason for placing that sensor between the patient and the ventilator. All of the examined 
humidity sensors exhibited similar characteristics though. A sensor capable of accurately 
measuring at low RH levels would be ideal, since it could be placed close to the heater and 
possibly eliminating the need for sensors in the tube of any kind, save for one temperature sensor 
at the patient. 
6.1.3 Environmental Implications 
Hygiene and safety requirements are very stringent in clinical settings. Therefore, autoclaves are 
used to sterilize used instruments. However, making an instrument autoclavable will often add 
enormously to the material and production costs. In addition, acquiring and operating an 
autoclave is also costly, hence the reason for many medical tools being of disposable single-use 
design today. On the other hand, single-use items are likely to have a more considerable 
environmental impact.  
The overall design of the prototype is a combination of single-use and multiple-use/permanent 
parts. The main unit of the prototype, consisting of the water basin, nebulizer, and heater, is 
thought to be permanent, though it is uncertain if the acrylic of the water basin will withstand

David Yang 
autoclave cycles. The heated tube and its sensors are currently not designed to be used multiple 
times. As a result, using this prototype is very expensive since a large portion of the bill of 
materials for the prototype is due to the sensors. The best way to cut down on both operating cost 
and environmental impact would be to redesign the tube to ensure the sensors are permanent and 
need not to be replaced. Methods for ensuring that no bacterial growth occurs, or cutting costs of 
sensors should be developed. 
6.2 Conclusion 
6.2.1 Market Survey 
It has become apparent during the work on this Master’s thesis that a considerable amount of 
research in this field has already been done. The HH and HME are the most commonly practiced 
humidification techniques used today in hospitals. These two techniques are already well 
established within the ventilator market with well-known advantages and disadvantages. There is 
however a plethora of interesting solutions that seem promising. This is especially true for the 
various aHME solutions. Few solutions have however been found that can function integrated 
with a ventilator. Most humidifier products are controlled separately (or no control for passive 
humidifiers). The prototype developed for this Master’s thesis was designed from the very start 
to be integrated with a ventilator, and this is believed to be one of its primary strengths. 
 
The problem dealt with in this Master’s thesis has been known for a long time, and many 
companies have endeavored to develop the perfect humidifier. This is reflected by the large 
number of patents covering the subject. This became apparent during the final stage of the 
development process, when MCC’s patent expert found a patent (Patent No. US 6,918,389 B2) 
covering many of the ideas that were utilized in the prototype. Some of the features mentioned in 
this patent are: 
• A humidification apparatus comprising a humidification chamber that the air passes through. 
The apparatus is connected to the patient with breathing tubes. 
• Using two sensors for absolute humidity, one at the humidifier and one closer to patient. 
Condensation is detected using the difference between the absolute humidity sensors.  
• Use of a heated breathing tube to avoid condensation. 
• Overheating the gas in the humidifier and having a controlled temperature profile along the 
tube to minimize condensation and approach the desired temperature. 
It was a surprise that this patent existed and covered so much of the prototype ideas. The patent 
confirmed that some of the ideas were indeed valuable but it complicates the possible future use 
of the developed prototype.  
6.2.2 Concept Conclusion 
The concept provides the ability to 
• Control the temperature and humidity of the patient’s inspired gas independently of each 
other. 
• Avoid tube condensation through heating the tube over the inspiration gas’s dew point.  
• Have flexible tubing from ventilator to patient. 
• Reduce the need for bulky and heavy devices close to the patient. 
• Avoid extra deadspace and added WOB to the patient. 
If the technical obstacles in realizing the concept are overlooked, only a temperature sensor close 
to the patient is required for control (assuming that the humidity is measured inside the 
ventilator). This makes the humidifier almost completely transparent to the end user, the only 
revealing sign being the temperature sensor. A ventilator equipped with the humidifier could for

David Yang 
example be used with regular tubes and without sensor, providing none or a very basic level of 
humidity. Adding tubing with heater wires and temperature sensor would enable the full 
functionality of the humidifier.  
6.2.3 Prototype Conclusion 
The performance requirements were on the whole fulfilled, with a few minor reservations. The 
size requirements were unfortunately not satisfied, but there is room for improvement. Many of 
the components used in the prototype could be replaced with substitutes, which could result in 
lowered costs but also improved performance. The sturdiness of the device can and should be 
improved in order to raise the safety. 
6.2.4 Modelling Conclusion 
The Simulink model developed was on the whole successful. The simulations are good enough 
to predict the general behavior of the prototype. The model can be adjusted easily enough to 
simulate other humidifier designs and get a general idea without having to actually build them.  
There are however several simplifications in the current model that turned out to be 
inappropriate. First among these is the assumption that all supplied water would stick to the 
heating coil. This was easily proven by a simple inspection, where the mist could at times be 
detected in the gas stream after the heater. This means the true behavior of the supplied water is a 
more complex thermo/fluid-dynamic interaction. The second inadequacy of the model is the 
nebulizer’s water generation. The real nebulizer proved to be not only time-variant but also 
exhibit severe stochastic behavior.  
6.2.5 Method Conclusion  
The method found in Chapter 1.5 was the initial idea of how the development would be carried 
out. It was however subjected to minor changes during the process, because of a number of 
reasons. 
The idea to develop the prototype using an iterative procedure, with every iteration lasting for 
approximately 2 weeks, was unfeasible due to long manufacturing times. In the end only one 
prototype was created, and all efforts went into making it work. Fortunately, it turned out to be 
successful.

7 Further Development and Recommendations 
The work performed has been a question of priorities from the choice of concept to the final 
prototype. Potentially interesting ideas and promising technical solutions have been rejected in 
the attempt to build a complete system during the limited time. A few suggestions to further 
development are found below. 
7.1 Prototype Improvements 
Following are some recommendations to improve the existing prototype: 
1. Adding the heated tubing to system control. The heated tube in the prototype is supplied 
with a constant voltage. Controlling the energy supplied to the tube would enable much faster 
response from input to output as the response is faster from the tube than from the main 
heater. This could be used to even out the oscillations in temperature found during tests.  
2. Other tubing concepts. Well insulated passive tubes (no heating) were proven to work, but 
at the cost of reduced flexibility and shorter maximum length of the tubes as well as longer 
temperature response times. Passive tubes could be made cheaper than active though.  
3. Better aerosol generator. An interesting solution is the micropump from Aerogen, 
mentioned in Chapter 3.2.3. Using such smaller aerosol generators producing a more 
homogenous mist would enable a more compact design, adding the mist through the tubing 
wall just before the heater. It should be possible to achieve a more even rate of water supply 
than the current nebulizer, which should also enable better control.  
4. Condensation detection/avoidance system. Intelligence could be added to the system to 
avoid condensation in tubes, automatically lowering the humidity if condensation is found. 
This could be realized in different ways: 1) Measuring AH at beginning and end of tubing. If 
there is an AH discrepancy, it can be deduced condensation has occured. 2) Measuring tube 
wall temperature, deciding lowest allowed dew point for the gas. 3) Optical measurements 
detecting water droplets on a piece of the tube inner wall (utilizing the difference in 
refractive index between air and water).  
5. A more compact design. The prototype’s current design is bulky to allow for easy 
alterations in function. The outer dimensions could easily be halved using the same 
components.  
6. Improved control design. It is believed the prototype’s control performance can be 
improved by using a Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control design on an improved 
model of the prototype. A Kalman filter should effectively reduce the noise when estimating 
the state while the linear-quadratic regulator can be optimized to penalize the temperature 
and humidity errors. 
7. Alternative humidity measurement. Using methods capable of detecting humidity closer to 
0 or 100% RH would eliminate the need of a sensor positioned in between the ventilator and 
patient. The humidity sensor could then be placed either inside the ventilator or close to the 
patient where temperature is measured in the current prototype.
