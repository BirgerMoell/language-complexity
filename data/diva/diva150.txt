Abstract 
This project treats Additive Manufacturing (AM) for metallic material and the question if it is 
suitable to be used in the aeronautics industry. AM is a relatively new production method where 
objects are built up layer by layer from a computer model. The art of AM allows in many cases 
more design freedoms that enables production of more weight optimized and functional articles. 
Other advantages are material savings and shorter lead times which have a large economic value. 
An extensive literature study has been made to evaluate all techniques on the market and 
characterize what separates the different processes. Also machine performance and material 
quality is evaluated, and advantages and disadvantages are listed for each technique. The 
techniques are widely separated in powder bed processes and material deposition processes. The 
powder bed techniques allow more design freedom while the material deposition techniques 
allow production of large articles. The most common energy source is laser that gives a harder 
and more brittle material than the alternative energy sources electron beam and electric arc. 
Two specific techniques have been selected to investigate further in this project. Electron Beam 
Melting (EBM) from Arcam and Wire fed plasma arc direct metal deposition from Norsk 
Titanium (NTiC). EBM is a powder bed process that can manufacture finished articles in limited 
size when no requirements are set on tolerances and surface roughness. NTiC uses a material 
deposition process with electric arc to melt wire material to a near-net shape. The latter method 
is very fast and can produce large articles, but have to be machined to finished shape. A material 
investigation have been made where Ti6Al4V-material from both techniques have been 
investigated in microscope and tested for hardness. For the EBM-material have also surface 
roughness and weldability been investigated since the limited building volume often requires 
welding. The materials have mechanical properties better than cast material with respect to 
strength and ductility, but not as good as wrought material. Test results show that the difference 
in mechanical properties in different directions is small, even though the material has an 
inhomogeneous macrostructure with columnar grains in the building direction. The EBM-
material has a finer microstructure and a stronger material and, in combination with improved 
design freedom, this technique is most suitable for aerospace articles when the weldability is 
good and it is possible to surface work where requirements of the surface roughness are set.

Sammanfattning 
Det här projektet behandlar området Additiv Tillverkning (AM) för metalliska material och 
undersöker om det är lämpligt att använda vid produktion inom flygindustrin. AM är en relativt 
ny tillverkningsmetod där föremål byggs upp lager för lager direkt ifrån en datormodell. 
Teknikområdet tillåter i många fall större konstruktionsfriheter som möjliggör tillverkning av 
mer viktoptimerade och funktionella artiklar. Andra fördelar är materialbesparing och kortare 
ledtider vilket har ett stort ekonomiskt värde. 
En omfattande litteraturstudie har gjorts för att utvärdera alla tekniker som finns på marknaden 
och karakterisera vad som skiljer de olika processerna. Även maskiners prestanda och kvalité på 
tillverkat material utvärderas, och för varje teknik listas möjligheter och begränsningar. 
Teknikerna delas grovt upp i pulverbäddsprocesser och material deposition-processer. 
Pulverbäddsteknikerna tillåter större friheter i konstruktion, medan material deposition-
processerna tillåter tillverkning av större artiklar. Den vanligaste energikällan är laser som ger ett 
starkare men mer sprött material än de alternativa energikällorna elektronstråle och ljusbåge. 
Två specifika tekniker har valts ut för att undersöka närmare i detta projekt. Electron Beam 
Melting (EBM) från Arcam och Wire fed plasma arc direct metal deposition från Norsk 
Titanium (NTiC). EBM är en pulverbäddsprocess som kan tillverka färdiga artiklar i begränsad 
storlek då låga krav ställs på toleranser och ytfinhet. NTiC använder en material deposition-
process med en ljusbåge för att smälta ner trådmaterial till en nära färdig artikel. Den senare 
metoden är mycket snabb och kan tillverka stora artiklar, men måste maskinbearbetas till 
slutgiltig form. En materialundersökning har genomförts där Ti6Al4V-material från båda 
teknikerna har undersökts i mikroskop och testats för hårdhet. För EBM-material har även 
ytfinhet och svetsbarhet undersökts då begränsad byggvolym i många fall kräver fogning. 
Materialen har egenskaper bättre än gjutet material med avseende på styrka och duktilitet, men 
inte lika bra som valsat material. Provning visar att skillnaden på mekaniska egenskaper i olika 
riktningar är liten även fast materialet har en inhomogen makrostruktur med kolumnära korn i 
byggriktningen. EBM ger en finare mikrostruktur och ett starkare material och, tillsammans med 
de ökade konstruktionsfriheterna, så är det den tekniken som är bäst lämpad för flygplansartiklar 
då svetsbarheten är god och det finns möjlighet att bearbeta ytan till slutgiltigt krav.

1  INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background 
Additive manufacturing (AM) is a relatively new production method that allows the 
manufacturer to automatically create components directly from a CAD-model. The method is 
especially useful for companies that have a lower production rate and a large variation of 
components because of its flexibility and short lead time. It is also valuable when manufacturing 
components in material that is expensive or difficult to process because of minimal material 
waste and post-processing. Few companies use this method for serial production today but there 
are ongoing research projects to find out which AM-method to use and the quality of the material 
in the components produced with this method (Gibson, Rosen & Stucker, 2010). 
1.2 Purpose 
SAAB wishes to expand the knowledge of AM because the benefits of this manufacturing 
method seem to fit for their production. The definition of the project is to investigate different 
AM-methods for SAAB’s production and evaluate these for selected components. The 
assignments are: 
 Literature study for the AM-techniques Electron Beam Manufacturing, Direct Metal 
Laser Sintering and Direct Metal Deposition + other interesting AM-techniques for 
metal 
 Document advantages and disadvantages for the different AM-techniques 
 Material investigations: Microstructure, porosity, surface roughness, hardness of AM-
material 
 Evaluate proposals of components within Saab Aeronautics that can be advantageous 
to produce with AM with respect to material, cost, strength etc. 
 Develop Business Case for selected components. 
1.3 Delimitations 
This is a pilot study of the introduction of AM at SAAB and will not include any implementation 
of the technique in the production. The investigation of different AM-techniques will be limit to 
these concerning metal material. Study of real material samples will be limited to material from 
two different techniques. The material investigations are limited to study with light optic 
microscopy, welding test and measuring of surface roughness and hardness. The business cases 
will be limited to just a few articles and two AM-techniques. 
1.4 Method 
In the first phase of the project a literature study will be made to evaluate different AM-
techniques. Together with supervisors at SAAB a few techniques will be selected for further 
investigation based on advantages and disadvantages. A concept selection matrix will be created 
to select which AM-techniques those are interesting for further investigation. The matrix is 
developed in cooperation with the supervisors at SAAB to get the company’s opinion of what is 
important. In the next phase of the project AM-material samples will be investigated with 
microscope in the material laboratory at KTH, and the surface roughness and hardness will be 
 
2 
measured at SAAB. Furthermore, proposed components will be evaluated whether they are 
suitable for AM-production by developing business cases and compare these with conventional 
production.

2  FRAME OF REFERENCE 
The reference frame is a summary of the existing knowledge and former performed research on 
the subject. This chapter presents the theoretical reference frame that is necessary for the 
performed research, design or product development. 
2.1 Additive manufacturing 
Additive Manufacturing (AM) is a common name for several different methods of building 
articles directly from a computer model. Other designations of the concept is Rapid 
Manufacturing (RM) and Layer Based Manufacturing (LBM) or in public speech 3D-printing 
(Gibson, Rosen & Stucker, 2010). 
In AM objects are built up layer by layer to a finished article or a near-net shape depending on 
the AM-technique and the requirements of the article. The shape of each layer is taken directly 
from CAD-data and the layers are fused with a heat source. Instead of machining a block of 
material as in conventional methods the material is positioned in the right place automatically by 
the machine. With this technique the material waste from machining is almost eliminated and the 
lead time of the article is strongly reduced due to fewer steps to plan in the production. This 
decreases the production cost due to less material use and reduced man-hour needed in 
production. Certain AM-techniques does also allow very complex shapes which gives more 
freedom for the designer to optimize weight reduction and functionality of the article (Gibson, 
Rosen & Stucker, 2010). 
The drawbacks of AM are preliminary that the processes are not as well-known as conventional 
methods. Conventional machining, wrought and casting have been developed over centuries for 
optimal performance and in that sense AM is a new production method. During the development 
of AM the products have often suffered from bad accuracy, surface finish, material strength, 
inhomogeneity and limited size. Because of this the technology has mainly been used for 
prototyping to check the function of the product. However during the last years a lot has 
happened in the field of AM and the researchers have improved the performance making it good 
enough to use in actual production for high performance products. Today AM is mainly used by 
the aeronautics and medical industry (Gibson, Rosen & Stucker, 2010). 
 
2.1.1 Definitions 
For all techniques the object is built layer by layer starting at the bottom and working its way up 
to the top of the part. For the building process there are some commonly applied definitions. 
Figure 1 shows this for a material deposition process for Ti-6Al-4V material, but the definitions 
are the same for all methods and materials. In most processes the building starts on a base plate 
in the same material as the article material. From the base plate a coordinate system is defined 
where the base plate is in the XY-plane and the Z-direction is pointing straight up. The material 
is deposited in strings to fill out the whole layer and the building direction in the XY-plane is 
defined as the direction perpendicular to the deposition direction. The building direction for the 
whole object is in positive Z-direction where the layers are deposited.  
When investigating the material it is interesting to compare properties in different directions of 
the material. Then it is possible to make samples like tensile test pieces in different directions. 
These are named after the direction they are oriented in, like the sample in Figure 1 (Brandl, 
Leyens & Palm, 2009). In mechanical testing when the properties are tested in both the building 
direction and perpendicular they are mentioned thereafter. In a tensile test in building direction it 
is pulled across the layers and is sometimes notated with the symbol ┴. In a tensile test 
 
4 
perpendicular to the building direction they are ripped along the layers and are notated with the 
symbol //.  
 
 
Figure 1: Definition of directions (Brandl, Leyens & Palm, 2009) 
2.2 AM-techniques for metal 
AM was first developed for polymer materials. The first patent was Stereo-lithography that could 
create solid objects from a polymer bath. The machine was built in 1987 and then several 
different methods were developed during the late 1980s and early 1990s, including techniques 
that could create metal objects (Boivie, 2013).  
AM for metals are not as wide as for polymer materials, but there is still a wide selection of 
different machines. An overview for this is seen in Figure 2. They are widely divided into 
powder bed processes and material deposition processes. In the powder bed process the articles 
is built by applying layers of metal powder and fuse each layer with a heat source. In the material 
deposition processes material in shape of powder, wire or sheets is added in layers and fused 
with a heat source. The next classification is the type of heat source used. The dominant heat 
source is laser followed by arc and electron beam. At this level there are several benchmarks for 
the technology used by different manufacturers. Different benchmarks in the same category are 
separated through specific features and patents owned by the manufactures (Gibson, Rosen & 
Stucker, 2010).

2.2.1 Powder bed processes 
There are several different powder bed processes but they do all have a common approach. A 
rake spread a thin layer of powder over the working area, followed by a heat source that fuses the 
powder to a solid layer, se Figure 3. The working area is lowered the same height as the powder 
layer and then a new layer of powder is spread over the whole working area followed by the 
heating source that fuses the next layer of the object to the existing. This is repeated until the top 
of the object have been built and the working area consists of a powder bed for the object. The 
lowering of the working area is necessary to keep an even level on the top layer of the powder 
bed. The working area is enclosed and either filled with an inert gas or vacuum enclosed to 
protect the molten metal from reacting with the air (Gibson, Rosen & Stucker, 2010) 
 
Figure 3: Schematic picture of the laser based powder bed process (Boivie, 2013) 
The process is able to create complex shapes like undercuts and cavities without any permanent 
support material since the structure is supported by the surrounding powder. Often a web of 
support material is created in areas with undercuts, but this web can easily be removed after the 
building process. The powder that is not melted can be reused a limited amount of times for 
creating other articles since the powder is protected from air in the working area and only slowly 
contaminated. A general drawback of the powder bed process is that the possible building size of 
the object is limited by the size and leveling height of the building area platform (Gibson, Rosen 
& Stucker, 2010). 
Selective laser sintering 
Selective laser sintering (SLS) was the first commercialized powder bed process, developed at 
the University of Texas, Austin, which holds the patent of the process since 1989. In this process 
a high power laser is used to heat the powder and sinter it to a solid body. Sintering means that 
the powder creates metallurgical bindings without reaching melting temperature. This is a slow 
process in which it is practically impossible to achieve full density, so there will be fine porosity 
in the material. The laser equipment is the same as for laser welding. A high power laser is 
focused with lenses and directed with mirrors driven by electrical motors. For powder bed 
processes with laser the working chamber is enclosed and filled with an inert gas to prevent the 
molten material to reach with air. Normally Helium or Argon is used to fill the chamber and the 
oxygen content is very low (Gibson, Rosen & Stucker, 2010). 
3D-systems (USA) and EOS (Germany) was the first companies to commercialize the process 
and they use two different approaches. 3D-systems have launched the machine Vanguard HS 
which use a metal and polymer mixture in the powder bed while EOS uses the technique Direct 
 
7 
Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS) which means that they use only metal powder (Abdel Ghany & 
Moustafa, 2006). 
In an investigation by Abdel Ghany & Moustafa (2006) compared the Vanguard HS and the EOS 
system M 250 X by building the same part in steel material. 3D-systems Vanguard HS do only 
melt the polymer powder so that it glues the metal particles to a low density (about 70 %) green 
part. After the printing process the object needs to be infiltrated with bronze at an elevated 
temperature and reached a density of 99.23 %. The M 250 X used only steel powder to sinter the 
material and reached a density of 95.2 % without post treatment. The Vanguard turned out to 
have better detail resolution, smoother surface and less defects than the M 250 X. The 
manufacturing of the Vanguard product was also faster than the M 250 X, 35.5 hours against 58 
hours. However, the Vanguard sample has very high copper content (> 12 %) from the 
infiltration which limits the strength, hardness and weldability of the material making it most 
suitable for die inserts. Abdel Ghany & Moustafa are also critical to the process parameters of 
the M 250 X machine since the sample had defects and bad resolution.  
Selective laser melting 
The process for selective laser melting (SLM) is similar to SLS. The difference is the 
temperature in the fusion where SLM fully melts the powder. What made this process possible 
was the use of Nd:YAG-laser instead of CO2-laser that was used for sintering, in for example 
EOS M250X. The Nd:YAG-laser delivers a shorter wave length than the CO2-laser which is 
more easily absorbed by the metal powder so that the energy efficiency increases and a more 
concentrated melt pool can be achieved. Today it is the fiber laser that is the most common 
technology. The fiber laser beam has similar properties as the Nd:YAG-laser but with greater 
energy efficiency and a longer life length (Gibson, Rosen & Stucker, 2010). The trends is that 
the former SLS-companies such as EOS and 3D-printing are moving over to fiber laser in their 
later machines, like EOS M400, which have provided better performance and possibility to 
process high temperature materials like Titanium and completely melt the material (EOS, 
2014a). 3D-printing have developed a series of machines based on a technique that they call 
Direct Metal which is a SLM process where they only use metal powder and full melting in 
contrast to their older Vanguard machine. They got the technique when the bought Phenix 
systems (Germany) which was an early developer of SLM machines (3D Systems, 2013a)  
The trademark SLM is owned by the German companies SLM Solution GmbH and ReaLizer 
GmbH. They produce AM systems as well as other rapid manufacturing systems and have a 
series of SLM machines where SLM 500 HL is the newest and biggest. It has the possibility to 
run with two fiber lasers at the same time to increase productivity (SLM Solutions, 2013). 
Concept laser (Germany) is another large manufacturer of laser melting machines. With the new 
machine Xline 1000R Concept laser delivers the largest powder bed for metal material (630 mm 
x 400 mm x 500 mm). Concept laser uses a specific patented technology called laserCUSING 
that uses stochastic navigation to produce islands in the layer that are built together. This is 
supposed to reduce the residual stresses in the manufactured object (3D Systems, 2013a). In the 
investigation mentioned above Abdel Ghany & Moustafa (2006) compared the concept laser 
machine M3 linear with the SLM-machines. M3 linear turned out to be as good at details and 
overall visual performance as the Vanguard, but without need of the infiltration process that 
resulted in a very high copper content in the Vanguard sample. Therefore laser melting is 
probably the most suitable laser based powder bed process for making high performance articles 
according to the investigation by Abdel Ghany & Moustafa. The drawback of this method 
according to the investigation is that the manufacturing time was much longer than the SLS 
processes (121 hours). In the investigation a lamp pumped Nd:YAG laser and according to the 
manufacturer the production speed can be increased by using a diode pumped laser Nd:YAG 
laser, the one that laserCUSING use in their new machines.

Laser based powder bed processes do often cause a lot of residual stresses in the produced 
articles. They are often performed in a cold atmosphere and the laser beam has a very small focal 
diameter which provides fast heating and cooling. The rapid heating and cooling creates a lot of 
swelling and shrinking of the material that is constrained by the surroundings. When building an 
object that is not attached in a powder bed with a laser beam residual stresses result in 
deformation of the object. Therefore all objects are attached to a base plate and have to be cut off 
when the object is finished. The base plate constrains the parts so that deformation is prevented, 
which causes even higher residual stresses. High residual stresses can cause inhomogeneous 
behaviour in shape of hindered deformation in the stress directions and cause cracks. Because of 
this the articles often have to be heat treated for stress relief after the AM-process (Mercelis & 
Kruth, 2006). 
There was an idea of reducing these residual stresses by using an elevated chamber temperature 
during the build process. Pre-heating of the workspace for powder bed laser processes with 
infrared heater was developed at the University of Austin in the early 90s in order to be able to 
process high temperature materials with a CO2-laser and to reduce deflection and residual 
stresses in the work piece (McWilliams, Hysinger & Beaman 1992). This technique has however 
not been adopted by any of the large manufactures of powder bed laser processes today. 
 Electron beam melting 
In electron beam melting (EBM) the heat is generated by an electron beam. The electron beam 
equipment is the same as for electron beam welding. Electrons are accelerated from a cathode 
and magnetically focused with magnetic coils that direct the electron beam at the powder bed, 
see Figure 4. This technique allows very fast transition of the heat source in the powder bed. The 
electrons are heating the metal powder with kinetic energy which, in contrast to using a laser, 
only is useable for metals and other conductive materials. Accelerated electrons in gas at 
atmosphere pressure interfere with atoms in the gas, so electron beams needs to be kept in a 
vacuum atmosphere thus a more complex machine than for laser processes will be needed. A 
benefit of this system compared to laser is the high energy efficiency of the electron beam 
resulting in less energy cost (Gibson, Rosen & Stucker, 2010).  
The technique was developed at Chalmers University and commercialized by Arcam AB 
(Sweden). Arcam is a rather young company which was founded in 1997 and released their first 
machine in 2002. The Arcam A2 machine was released in 2007 and in 2009 there was a release 
of Arcam A2X which should be more suitable for high temperature materials, like Titanium. 
2013 a new machine called Arcam Q20 have replaced A2 for aerospace applications with higher 
productivity and better quality. The Q-series do also have a new visual system where a camera 
takes a picture of every layer to control that the processes operates correctly (Arcam, 2014a). 
The object is built on a start plate of stainless steel. The steel might contaminate the closest 
layers of material when manufacturing in another material, so there might be a need of removing 
the bottom layer. When producing Titanium articles the plate will come off by itself as the 
temperature is lowered because of the creation of a brittle intermetallic phase in the transition. 
When producing articles in material that is combinational with the stainless steel, for example 
Nickel, the plate will remain and have to be cut loose. When making complex shapes, like 
undercuts, a support structure is built by melting a layer with lower energy to build the undercut 
on. This provides better geometrical tolerances of the built object than without support structure, 
and helps the control of the fusion process. The support structure can be removed by hand when 
finished (Ackelid, 2014). 
Just as SLM the EBM process fully melts the metal powder making a fully dense object without 
any defects apart from small spherical pores originated from the gas inclusions in the gas 
atomized powder. These spherical pores are small (<100µm) and eliminated if Hot Isostatic 
Pressing (HIP) is applied. During early stages of development of a new material for EBM, when 
 
9 
the process parameters are still immature, elongated pores are sometimes seen as a consequence 
of lack of fusion between layers. These pores are usually bigger and therefore more difficult to 
eliminate with HIP. However, once the parameters have been fully optimized, the only 
remaining porosity is the spherical gas bubbles originating from the powder. Possible causes of 
the lack of fusion are bad focus calibration of the electron beam, unsuitable parameters of beam 
current and scan speed, wrong settings for powder deposition, powder with to high content of 
contamination or insufficient support structure (Ackelid, 2014).  
Arcam make use of the high speed of the electron beam to preheat each layer of the powder by 
passing the beam over the whole powder bed with a large focal spot and low power. With this 
they maintain a powder bed temperature of about 600-650 ºC to reduce residual stresses and 
avoid rapid cooling that leads to brittle material. During the melting of the material the machine 
uses a smaller focal spot and a higher power. The cooling from melting temperature to the 
elevated operating temperature is very rapid because of the small melt pool and the material is 
kept in the elevated temperature during the whole building process. The material is then held at 
the elevated building temperature through the whole building process, followed by a slow 
cooling to room temperature when the process is finished (Rafi et al., 2013). 
 
Figure 4: Electron beam melting by Arcam (Arcam, 2014c) 
Rafi et al. (2013) have made a comparison between the microstructure and mechanical properties 
of Ti6Al4V material made by the EBM machine Arcam S400 and the DMLS machine EOS 
M270. The materials tests was made in the as build condition without any post-processing such 
as grinding or heat treatment. They found out that the EBM process delivered ductile material 
 
10 
with tensile strength comparable to the same material in cast and annealed condition, while SLM 
delivered a more brittle material with higher strength and fatigue limit than EBM. This is 
because the EBM process has a longer cooling time which gives a softer material. They did also 
observe that the surface finish was smoother for the SLM sample, which they related to that the 
EBM process was running with thicker layers and with a larger powder size. The effect of the 
pre-heating is the major difference between SLM and electron beam, giving different 
microstructure and material properties.  
According to Brandl, Leyens & Palm (2009) one of the benefits with running the AM process in 
vacuum is that post-processing as Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP) can close remaining porosity with 
a very good result. Pores in material made by AM-processes in inert gas contain remains of the 
gas and is therefore more difficult to close. 
 
2.2.2 Material deposition processes 
In material deposition processes the material is added by melting a continuous flow of material 
and deposit the material layer by layer. There are different variants in this process. The flow of 
material can be in shape of powder or wire, and the heat source could be laser, plasma arc or 
electron beam. Different distributors use different combinations of material and heat source 
where powder and laser beam is the most common. A certain material deposition process does 
also use metal sheets as deposit material.   
Deposition processes are more limited than the powder bed processes when it comes to complex 
shapes. While the powder bed have natural support in the powder bed, the deposition processes 
needs to have external support material or specific arrangement to create undercuts and cavities. 
The possibility of creating complex shapes varies a lot between different deposition methods.  
The benefits with the deposition processes are that the work space is not limited by the size of 
the powder bed but from the spatial limitations of the robot holding the deposition nozzle. In 
some cases it is not even necessary to use an enclosed chamber for the working area since the 
nozzle includes channels that deliver shielding gas locally where there is molten material. This 
makes it simpler to create systems capable of creating large objects and opens for possibilities to 
perform reparations of existing objects (Gibson, Rosen & Stucker, 2010). 
 Wire feed plasma arc direct metal deposition 
Norsk Titanium (Norway) uses a combination of a feeding wire and a plasma arc as heat source. 
They have specialized at using Ti6Al4V (Grade 5) and titanium grade 2 and use an enclosed 
chamber with argon as shield gas. The plasma arc is the same as used for plasma arc welding 
with transferred arc. A pilot arc is created between a tungsten electrode and an anode at the inner 
nozzle for ignition. The work piece has a positive charge that overruns the anode in the nozzle 
and creates a transferred arc between the tungsten electrode and the work piece as the process 
begins. The arc is stabilized with a high pressure flow of argon plasma gas inside the inner 
nozzle that transports the heat out of the nozzle. There is also an outer nozzle with argon 
shielding gas that can be used for cooling of the molten material and to stabilize the arc. The 
energy from the arc is directed at one or two continuously fed titanium wires which are the 
deposition material. In the new machines by Norsk Titanium an electric current is lead through 
the wires creating a MIG welding process for material deposition. Here the electrode has a 
negative charge like the plasma beam electrode and the work piece has a positive charge in order 
to get a transferred arc, see Figure 5 for a principle sketch over the Norsk Titanium Process. 
 
11 
 
Figure 5: Principe for Norsk Titanium technique (Norsk Titanium 2012) 
The plasma beam makes it possible to reach very high deposit rates, up to 5.1 kg/h. However the 
material deposition is very rough and the process can only create near-net shapes that have to be 
machined to become a complete article, see Figure 6. The material is deposited layer by layer on 
a bottom plate of the same material, and it is possible to deposit material on both sides of the 
bottom plate. It is beneficial if the bottom plate can act as a natural part of the finished article as 
in Figure 6 (Norsk Titanium, 2012). 
 
Figure 6: Component made by Norsk Titanium in different phase of the process (Lajer, 2012)) 
The advantage of the process is the high material deposition speed that is possible when only 
creating near-net shapes because there are fewer requirements on tolerances. The plasma arc is 
also a very energy efficient heat source which provides economic benefits. Norsk Titanium 
creates the wires from titanium sponge and alloying particles. The wire extrusion process is more 
efficient and does not require as advanced equipment as the powder atomization process. 
Because of this the raw material is cheaper which is beneficial for high production rates. Wire 
material is generally purer compared to powder material due to less surface area in connection to 
the surroundings. This is beneficial for materials sensitive to oxygen, such as Titanium, since it 
will not be contaminated from the air (Brandl, Leyens & Palm, 2009) 
 Powder deposition 
Lasers in combination with powder feeding are the most common deposition processes. The 
powder is continuous fed through a nozzle directed at the deposition spot where it is melted by 
the laser beam. The powder is transported with a gas to force the deposition to the right place and 
 
12 
making it possible to add material at non horizontal surfaces. The nozzle can be a coaxial powder 
feeder that is integrated in the laser beam head or an external single nozzle powder feeder on the 
side, see Figure 7. The most common in modern machines are using co-axial nozzle feeding with 
2-4 separate nozzles (Gibson, Rosen & Stucker, 2010). 
 
Figure 7: Nozzle feeding configurations (Gibson, Rosen & Stucker) 
Optomec (USA), BeAM (France) and DM3D (USA) are three large manufacturers of these 
systems. Optomec have a trademark called Laser Engineered Net Shaping (LENS), BeAM has a 
trademark called CLAD (Direct additive manufacturing by laser) and POM Group inc. created a 
trademark called Direct Metal Deposition (DMD). POM Group inc. was bought by DM3D 
technology in 2013 so the DMD trademark does currently belong to DM3D technology (Belforte 
2013). There are small differences in the equipment of the different manufacturers but the 
techniques are very similar. In a comparison of their later machines (Magic from BeAM (BeAM, 
2014b), LENS 850 R from Optomec (Optomec, 2014a) and DMD IC106 from DM3D (Direct 
Industry, 2014b)) all systems use the same concept of powder feeding (the co-axial nozzle), an 
enclosed chamber filled with inert gas, a fiber laser, possibilities of 2-4 separate powder nozzles 
and 5-axis deposition unit (6-axix for DMD IC106, robot mount). Apart from this DM3D has 
made an arrangement that is directly mounted on a 6-axis robot with no enclosed chamber. In 
this product the only shield gas comes out of the nozzle to cover the area where the robot is 
currently adding material, making it possible to use a very small machine but with great range. 
The larger model, DMD 66R, have a work envelope of 2330 x 1670 x 1670 mm (Direct Industry, 
2014a). There is however an increased risk of getting impurities in the material when working 
outside an enclosed chamber, and this is not recommended for materials such as titanium which 
is very sensitive to oxygen in high temperatures. 
Powder fed deposition processes makes it possible to create gradient objects by regulating the 
scanning and powder feeding speed. When having separate nozzles and powder depots it is also 
possible to regulate eventual alloying elements for different positions in the object. If operated 
correctly it is for example possible to create an object with a ductile core and a hard surface that 
can resist worn (Gibson, Rosen & Stucker, 2010). 
The microstructure in laser based deposition processes is similar to the one for laser based 
powder bed processes. The material is generally hard and brittle due to high cooling rate. Yu et 
al. (2012) have studied the microstructure in Ti6Al4V for a laser based powder deposition 
process and discovered that the strength of the material is superior to cast and annealed material, 
but that the elongation is lower.  
 
13 
Powder deposition processes are known for low deposition rates and relatively low material 
usage. In a study by Ul Haq Syed, Pinkerton & Li (2012) it was proven that the material use also 
depends on the laser power. When the laser power was increased from 700 W to 1300 W the 
material use was increased from 8% to 40% with the same feed rate. The rest of the powder 
passes on the side of the melt pool into the atmosphere and do not melt. 
Electron beam free form fabrication 
Sciaky inc. (USA) uses a technique called Electron Beam Free Form Fabrication (EBFFF) in 
which they use an electron beam to melt a feeding metal wire. Same as for EBM the work piece 
have to be sealed in a Vacuum chamber for the electron beam to be functional. 
Sciaky is a company that have made welding machines since 1939 and delivers systems for 
electron beam welding, arc welding and resistance welding. According to Sciaky their electron 
beam welding machines can be used for AM, which makes it possible to create objects in 
dimensions of 4927 x 2286 x 1778 mm with their largest machine Sciaky VX.4-198 x 134 x 126 
(the dimensions for electron beam welding) (Sciaky, 2014b). This is the largest working area 
provided by any manufacturer of AM machines and open for possibilities to create large objects 
without need of welding. 
Since Sciaky uses wire material they have similar benefits and drawbacks as Norsk Titaniums 
Wire feed plasma arc direct metal deposition. Wire fed deposition have a higher deposition rate 
than powder based methods, but the product is only a rough near-to-net part that has to be 
machined after the AM process.  
NASA shows specific interest in the EBFFF technology since it can be performed in a zero 
gravity environment, which makes it possible to use AM to create tools in space. Aeromat have 
successfully performed EBFFF in a zero gravity environment, something that is impossible for 
powder bed processes and unfavourable for powder deposition because of difficulty to store 
powder in zero gravity. Another benefit of the EBFFF technique in space is the high energy 
efficiency to reduce waste of energy where it is a limited resource and the natural access of 
vacuum (Brice & Taminger, 2011). 
 Laminated object manufacturing 
Laminated object manufacturing techniques are based on building objects from depositing layers 
of metal sheets, cut them to the right shape and fuses them together. The cutting is normally done 
by milling and the fusing is done by either adhesives or ultrasonic welding, called Ultrasonic 
Consolidation (UC). The ultrasonic welding is done by a roller passing over the material and 
sending micro vibrations that are transformed into heat between the metal sheets, see Figure 8. 
Machines using the UC technique do not need to have an enclosed work space since the fusion of 
the layers occurs between the deposited sheet and the work piece, so the molten material is not in 
contact with the environment like the other AM-methods (Gibson, Rosen & Stucker, 2010). 
 
14 
 
Figure 8: Concept sketch of UC 
Fabrisonic is a manufacturer that uses this technique. Their biggest machine Soniclayer 7200 
simply uses a working table and a 3 – axis machine for sheet deposition and CNC-machining 
without any sealed chamber. The machine can make complex shapes and work over an area of 
1830 x 1830 x 915 mm with relatively simple equipment (Fabrisonic, 2014a). 
Laminated object manufacturing is totally automatic process and can create complete parts 
without need of post-processing. It can build complex shapes like cavities, overlaps and 
inclusions giving design freedom. The ultrasonic welding can create metallurgic bindings 
between different metals and with particle and fibers between the layers which make it possible 
to create composites with customized properties (Gibson, Rosen & Stucker, 2010). However, no 
material is saved compared to processing wrought material like all the other AM-techniques. The 
material used depends on the height and outer dimensions of the object and not the actual shape. 
This does more likely increase the material cost compared to using a block of wrought material, 
although it possesses the other benefits of AM.  
 
2.2.3 Other processes 
Apart from the presented AM-techniques there are other more uncommon combinations. One 
technique is the powder bed adhesive process by ExOne. Similar to 3D-systems Vanguard it 
glues the metal particles together to create a green part that is sintered and infiltrated, but the 
ExOne technique actually deposit adhesives at the powder bed from a nozzle. After the building 
process the object is put in an oven to cure the adhesives for green strength. Then the part is put 
into a vacuum furnace for sintering and burning away the adhesives. The sintering is only able to 
create a 60 % density part and to reach acceptable density of about 95 % the part have to be 
infiltrated. A common combination is stainless steel infiltrated with Bronze (ExOne, 2012). The 
need of infiltration creates a completely different material so this process cannot be used as a 
replacement for conventional manufacturing of existing articles. Steels infiltrated with 35% 
Bronze is nor an attractive material because of the impossibility to remove copper from steel 
when recycling.  
Höganäs has a similar powder bed technique where they use an ink to bond the metal powder to 
a green part. After their sintering process they are supposed to reach 95-97% density which 
makes it unnecessary to infiltrate the material and the technique can therefore be used as all other 
AM techniques to replace conventional machining of existing articles. The strength of the ink-
based powder bed process is the increased detail resolution, tolerance and surface finish when 
the melt pool is avoided. The build speed is also faster than in the melting processes, but with 
need of sintering after treatment. Currently the material is limited to stainless steel but Höganäs 
is currently developing the process for Titanium as well (Kristiansson, 2014). This technique is 
so far novel and very little public research have been made which makes it difficult to evaluate. 
 
15 
There has also been some research about using laser or TIG-torch for wire deposition processes. 
The laser company Trumpf do research about laser wire deposition, and the AMRC with Boeing 
have research about the use of a TIG-torch which they call Shaped Metal Deposition (SMD). 
The desire of using wire instead of powder is that the wire does not react with the environment in 
the same extent as powder which makes it less sensitive for impurities. Another desire is the 
possibility of increasing the build speed and more simple equipment (Baumfeldt, Brandl & van 
der Biest, 2011). These techniques have however not really reached the market which makes it 
difficult to evaluate. 
Combining a laser based deposition system with a wire feeder instead of powder have been 
researched at some universities in Germany and Belgium in corporation with the laser company 
Trumpf (Brandl, Leyens & Palm, 2009) (Baumfeldt, Brandl & van der Biest, 2011) and in Great 
Britain with a Laserline LDL laser (Ul Haq Syedd, Pinkerton & Li, 2005). The technique is very 
uncommon on the market, but the research does reveal some interesting facts about the 
differences in wire and powder feed systems. This technique have a higher material usage and 
building speed than the laser based powder deposition processes, but it cannot create as complex 
shapes because of limited deposition angle. According to the research the mechanical properties 
was similar to powder feeding processes but it strongly depended on the deposition direction. 
2.3 Comparison of different AM techniques 
To compare which AM-technique that is most suitable for aerospace articles a number of aspects 
have to be considered. 
 
2.3.1 Material and geometrical limitations 
Geometric limitations of the machines and the available materials are investigated by studying 
the machines from the different manufacturers. Data in Table 1 is concerning the biggest and 
most up-to-date machines from each company to study the limitations and possibilities of each 
process.

Multi-material components (Fabrisonic, 2014b) 
Many manufacturers present similar materials. The high strength materials Titanium and Nickel-
based superalloys (e.g. Inconel) are commonly used in AM techniques. The reason is that there is 
a specific interest in using this technique for these materials. Using AM for expensive materials 
that are hard to machine is extra beneficial since there is great economic benefits and time 
savings. Laser, electron beam and plasma arc can probably process most metals, but it requires 
some research to tune the process for each material. Therefore the primary focus is to process 
attractive materials. Laser based processes can also create objects in polymers and certain 
ceramics. For polymer processing simpler equipment can be used (e.g. laser with lower power) 
and there is a lot of other manufacturers that focus on that. Electron beam is a little bit more 
limited since it can only process conductive materials like metals. Ultrasonic welding have 
problem with processing high temperature materials like Titanium-alloys and Nickel-alloys 
which is a major drawback when concerning the aeronautics industry. 
The powder can be blended with alloying elements to reach desired properties, something that 
for wire techniques and powder bed have to be done already in the production of the raw 
material. Powder deposition processes have more possibilities since it can use multiple nozzles 
with different material to change the chemical composition in the material in the same part 
(Gibson, Rosen & Stucker, 2010). 
 
 
17 
2.3.2 Mechanical properties 
Due to differences in heat conditions the produced material gets different material properties 
even though the base material is the same. The differences appear in the microstructure of the 
material.  
Some studies have been done for this on titanium alloys, especially Ti6Al4V which is a common 
material in the aerospace and medical industry. The material requirements for aerospace 
applications in AMS 4911 for conventional Ti6-4 are set as reference for the material properties. 
It is specified that the material shall have minimum tensile strength of 920 MPa, minimum yield 
strength of 869 MPa and minimum fracture elongation of 10 % (AMS, 2003).  
The common opinion is that when using laser based methods, powder bed and material 
deposition, a hard but somewhat brittle material is achieved in the as built condition. This is due 
to the rapid cooling when heating cold material very fast in small spot. On the other hand it is 
very low energy input in the process so the energy is rapidly transported from the melt pool to 
the cold material in the bottom plate and the surroundings. 
Rafi et al. (2013) compared the microstructure and mechanical properties of Ti6AL4V made in a 
DMLS process (EOS M270) and an EBM process (Arcam S400). The microstructure in the 
DMLS samples were martensite structure, so called α’(α’’)-phase. The material shows excellent 
strength but poor elongation in fracture. When using EBM each layer is pre-heated with the 
electron beam to keep an even temperature of 600-650ºC. Even though the electron beam 
intensity is higher than the laser beam, and the scanning speed is faster, it will still cool down 
slower because of the elevated temperature. This provides a different microstructure, so called α 
and β phase in a Widmanstätten structure. The as built material from the EBM process is not as 
strong as the laser material, but the fracture elongation is higher. However, both techniques 
showed better strength than the minimum requirements in AMS 4911 but to low fracture 
elongation especially for DSML samples. The DMLS samples showed a bigger spread in quality 
than the EBM samples. For both techniques the material was slightly stronger in the plane 
perpendicular to the building direction. 
The results from the investigation are similar to the data that EOS and Arcam provide. The 
strength is similar or better, but the elongation to fracture is not as good in this investigation as 
the manufacturers claim.  
Yu el al. (2012) have studied the mechanical properties of Ti6Al4V for a laser based powder 
deposition process and discovered similar material properties as for the DMLS sample in the 
investigation that H.K. Rafi et al. made. The microstructure showed α’-martensite phase with a 
high strength (Rp0.2 = 976 MPa, Rm = 1099 MPa) but poor elongation to fracture (4.9 %).  
Norsk Titanium has tested the mechanical properties of their own material made with the plasma 
arc direct metal deposition. The microstructure and the strength of the material seem to be 
similar to the material made in the EBM process. The microstructure consists of α and β phase in 
a Widmanstätten structure. The yield strength is reported to be 875 MPa in the building direction 
and 854 MPa perpendicular to the building direction. The ultimate strength is 930 MPa 
respectively 916 MPa, and the fracture elongation 11% and 14% (Norsk Titanium, 2012) 
A collection of mechanical properties of AM-material from different techniques is found in 
Table 2. All data consider the material Ti6Al4V, except when ELI is specifically notated where 
Ti6Al4V ELI is considered. The process and eventual post processing are mentioned in the 
method-column. If no post processing is mentioned it is not specified in the source. The direction 
is designated // for mechanical testing perpendicular to building direction and ┴ for mechanical 
testing in building direction.

2.3.3 Detail resolution and surface finish 
Detail resolution and surface finishing is very much depending on the current parameters in the 
machine. Safdar et al. (2012) used an Arcam S12 EBM system to investigate how scan speed, 
sample thickness, beam current and offset focus affected the surface roughness on Ti6Al4V 
powder. By combining these parameters Ra values of 1-20 μm was achieved. Their result 
showed that increased scan speed and offset focus decreased surface roughness and increased 
thickness and beam current increased surface roughness. The study indicates that the surface 
roughness is increasing when the energy input is increasing. Worth to mention is that the 
material properties was not investigated so any eventual negative effects of decreasing energy 
input, like lack of fusion between  the layers, was not evaluated. 
The general opinion is that the laser based powder bed processes have a better detail resolution 
and better surface finish than electron beam. EBM is therefore described as a method to create 
near-net shapes which indicates that the EBM-articles often need post-processing to fulfil the 
requirements of the article (Gibson, Rosen & Stucker, 2010). An example of the surface in as 
built condition for SLM and EBM can be seen in Figure 9 where Rafi et al. (2013) have made 
tensile test specimen in an EOS M270 SLM machine and an Arcam S400 EBM machine.

When comparing material deposition processes it is observed that the detail resolution is better 
for powder deposition, but the surface is generally smoother for wire deposition. The explanation

of this is that the powder deposition processes have unmolten powder on the surface and the wire 
deposition is transported in more of a liquid flow with surface when solidified. The powder 
deposition is slower and more controlled than the wire deposition which gives a better detail 
resolution for powder deposition (Ul Haq Syed, Pinkerton & Li, 2005). When concerning high 
productive wire based deposition processes, such as the systems from Norsk Titanium and 
Schiaky, the aim is to create a near-net shape that is going to be machined so the surface 
roughness does really not matter. Therefore the surface roughness for wire based deposition 
processes will not be furthered considered in this study. Karunakaran et al. (2012) have listed 
characteristics for some common AM-machines. These can be seen in Table 3.

2.3.4 Geometric complexibility 
In a powder bed process almost any shape can be created. It is possible to build structures with 
overlaps, cavities and separate parts linked together. The deposition based processes are more 
restricted since the machine has to build next layer on the previous layer as only support. In 
polymer processes the use of support material that can be dissolved is frequently used to build 
upon, but this is not so common in metal deposition (Gibson, Rosen & Stucker, 2010). However, 
the modern laser based powder deposition processes can manage to create more complex shapes. 
The previously mentioned machines EasyCLAD Magic, LENS 850R, DMD IC106 do all have 5-
axis systems and the powder is sprayed with a gas flow making it possible to accurate deposit the 
material even on non-horizontal surfaces. This makes it possible to create complex shapes like 
overlaps by directing the deposition of the material. According to a study by Ul Haq Syed, 
Pinkerton & Li (2005) a laser based powder deposition systems allowed deposition angles from 
0 to 180º without a reduced quality in the material. The laser based wire deposition processes did 
however only allow angles from 10 to 75º and then the string is getting irregular. This indicates 
that the powder deposition process allows more complex shapes than wire based.  
 
2.3.5 Residual stresses 
In all AM-methods residual stresses occur when the material melts and solidifies. Residual 
stresses can cause fractures and prevent deformation in certain directions. Worst is when tensile 
stresses in the surface decreases crack resistance. Depending on the different techniques and 
parameters the residual stresses differs. 
Merceli & Kruth (2006) have made an investigation about residual stresses in Stainless Steel 
(grade 316L) for the Concept laser M3 linear machine with laserCUSING. They found out that 
                                                 
1 From measurements in this project (section 4.2.1) 
2 Depending on the laser power used (Morey, 2008) 
 
21 
the residual stresses in the material strongly depended on the scanning direction. They created a 
10 mm thick rectangular shaped block and discovered that there is large tensile stresses on the 
top of the object, smaller tensile stresses on the bottom and compressive stresses in-between, 
around 1-2 mm below the surface. Scanning along the long side of the rectangular block gave 
less tensile stresses at the top surface than scanning along the short side of the block. By using 
the island-technology (see Selective laser melting) they observed a decrease of the total residual 
stress in the object but the tensile stresses in the surface was still bigger than the long track 
scanning. They did also investigate influence of post-scan every layer with a higher velocity, 
removing the base plate and pre-heat the bottom plate to a temperature of 200 ºC. Of these 
alternatives only removing of the base plate gave a great impact of residual stress reduction 
while the others gave a moderate impact of residual stress reduction. However, removing the 
base plate might result in large deformation of the article so that is not preferable.  
In the EBM process by Arcam the powder is pre-heated and the chamber is kept at an elevated 
temperature of 600-650ºC. When the part is finished the chamber is slowly cooled down to room 
temperature. This reduces the temperature gradients in the process which lowers the residual 
stresses. However the residual stresses are not eliminated so articles made with EBM still needs 
to be supported by a base plate. Edwards, O´conner & Ramulu (2013) measured residual stresses 
in a Ti6Al4V specimen made by an Arcam A1 machine with X-ray diffraction. They found out 
that there were tensile stresses at the top of the specimen and compressive stresses at the bottom.  
However, when they had reached a depth of about 0.03 mm the residual stresses were very small. 
According to the investigation the residual stresses had a maximum magnitude of about 150 MPa 
close to the surface. 
The residual stresses for the LENS method have been investigated by P. Rangaswamy et al. 
(2005). They used neutron diffraction to measure residual stresses in a stainless steel 316L 
specimen manufactured in a LENS machine. As the results from the laserCUSING investigation 
they discovered tensile stresses at the top and bottom of the sample and compressive stresses in-
between. The residual stresses reached a maximum magnitude of about 70 % of the yield 
strength of the material (Rp0.2 ~ 450 MPa for 316L). 
 
2.3.6 Build speed 
The build time depends on the material, geometry and the process parameters. It is difficult to 
specify the exact building speed of an AM-technique, but in some cases the manufacturers have 
specified maximum or typical building speeds. This will give an idea about the speed of the 
different processes, but the actual build speed will vary for each article (Karunakaran et al., 
2012). Ti6Al4V is the reference material. Compared to many other materials Ti6Al4V has a high 
melt point (1604 - 1660 °C) and low density (4.43 g/cm3) which makes it difficult to reach high 
build speeds with respect to mass. Table 4 presents the building speed for selected machines 
presented by Karunakaran et al. (2012).

2.3.7 Part cost 
In the manufacturing cost many aspects needs to be considered. The machine investment cost, 
life length, energy use, build speed, material cost, operation cost and post-processing. To 
compare the price for making an article in different processes business-cases have to be created 
in cooperation with the company that possess the machine.  
Morris Technologies Inc. (USA) possesses the EOS machines M270, M280 and the Arcam 
machine A2 and has made a comparative study for the different machines. They produced a 
turbine with diameter of 115 mm in the three machines and estimated the cost of producing the 
part to as-build condition, see Figure 10. 
 
Figure 10: Turbine from Morris Technology Inc.(Rengers, 2012) 
There were significant differences between the DMLS machines, where the M280 was much 
faster and cheaper and resulted in build time and cost similar to the Arcam A2 machine, see 
Table 5. Morris do still however expect a lower total price for the EBM process since it is not 
necessary with heat treatment (Rengers, 2012).

When considering AM techniques with wire feed, the cost of raw material is reduced since the 
wire extrusion manufacturing is simpler and faster than the powder atomization process. It will 
however be necessary to use more material because of the more rough shape that is created, and 
it will also need more machining after the build. Furthermore, conventional rolled titanium plates 
are even cheaper per weight unit, but will require even more machining. 
Machining of titanium is extra difficult because of the tough material, and therefore it is valuable 
also to reduce the large part of the machining. In a case study by Norsk Titanium a hot bolting 
clamp used for pressurized pipes in the oil/gas-industry was evaluated. It is a curved titanium 
shape with a weigh of 6.2 kg. In the case conventional production the material usage was 
estimated to a block with dimensions 600x200x80 mm and a weight of 43 kg (buy to fly ratio ~ 
7:1) and machining for almost 40 hours. By creating a near net shape, see Figure 11, Norsk 
Titanium can use a plate with dimension 600x200x10 mm and a weight of 5.5 kg. Then 12.5 kg 
wire is used which gives the total material usage of 18.7 kg (buy to fly ratio ~ 1:3). The 
machining for the Norsk Titanium production was estimated to just above 15 hours (Gjørvad, 
2012). By using a rule of thumb, that it is approximately as expensive to machine 1 kg of 
titanium as the material itself (Williams, 2012), the price of the Norsk Titanium article is 
estimated to be less than half as expensive as the conventionally made. 
 
Figure 11: Near net shape of the hot bolting clamp 
 
2.3.8 Environment 
Additive manufacturing is a technique that can reduce the environmental impact from the 
production. There is a lot of energy usage and emissions that can be reduced when only using the 
material needed for the article instead of machining a large part of a metal block. Based on 
previously mentioned characteristics of the different AM-systems the powder bed techniques 
have a high material usage and can reuse unmolten powder. The wire fed deposition processes 
creates more rough shapes and needs more machining afterwards which increase the material 
waste, and the powder fed deposition processes have a lower material usage in the deposition 
process. All these processes do however have very low material waste compared to conventional 
manufacturing and ultrasonic consolidation (Gibson, Rosen & Stucker, 2010). 
 
24 
AM also because of its flexibility make it possible to reduce the number of machines needed, 
which also reduce environmental impact. However, the AM machines do often have a very long 
run time so the energy needed to run the machine has a big impact in an environmental 
perspective. The required effect and the build speed are affecting the total energy consumption, 
but the machines are best compared by the energy efficiency of the heat source. Generally laser 
beams have poor energy efficiency, but the new fiber lasers are much more effective than CO2-
lasers. Still electron beam is more energy efficient than the lasers and using an arc as a heat 
source is even more efficient (Karunakaran et al., 2012) 
When considering working environment the handling of titanium powder might cause health 
issues. Titanium is low toxic but inhalation might cause coughing, pain in the chest and 
difficulties to breathing. Eye contact might cause irritation. Titanium powder stored in air is a 
significant fire hazard and an explosion hazard when heated in air. Titanium wire does not cause 
any health issues or hazards (Lenntech, 2014). 
2.4 Material 
Many materials can be used in 3D-printers but materials that are difficult to process and 
expensive materials get the most of the benefits compared to conventional machining. Therefore 
a lot of research have been made on titanium and especially the common titanium alloy Ti-6Al-
4V and the refined alloy Ti-6Al-4V ELI. Ti-6Al-4V can also be mentioned Titanium grade 5, 
Ti6-4 or similar. The titanium alloy contains approximately 6 % aluminium, 4 % vanadium and 
the rest titanium. Titanium is sensitive to high contents of oxygen and iron which is why the 
content of these needs to be low, especially in the Ti-6Al-4V ELI material which is purified to 
get low level of interstitials. The material has a melting point of 1604-1660ºC and a density of 
4.43 g/cm3. It is a material that combines low density with very high strength (ASM, 2014) 
There are some international standards concerning additive manufacturing. AMS 4999 (AMS, 
2011) specifies permissible content of different elements, minimum mechanical properties, 
permissible porosity, procedure for post-treatment etc. in an article produced with direct metal 
deposition. ASTM F2924 (ASTM, 2013a) is a corresponding standard for powder bed processes 
and F3001 (ASTM, 2013b) concerns Ti-6Al-4V ELI for powder bed processes. AMS 4998 
specifies characteristics for the powder which requires lower content of impurities than for the 
finished article in AMS 4999 (AMS, 2011) and ASTM F2924. ASTM F3001 does however 
require even lower content of impurities.  
The material gets different mechanical properties with different microstructure which is 
depending on the cooling speed of the material from above the beta transus temperature of 995 
ºC. Ti6Al4V have a microstructure made of so called α- and β-phase. The α-phase has a 
Hexagonal Closed-Packed (HCP) crystal structure and the β-phase have a Body Centered Cubic 
crystal structure. Above the beta transus temperature the microstructure consists of prior β-grains 
and as the temperature is lowered the α-phase is created inside the β-matrix, see Figure 12 for 
CCT diagram of Ti6Al4V (Sieniawski et al., 2013). 
 
25 
 
Figure 12: CCT diagram for Ti6Al4V (Sieniawski et al,.2013) 
Briefly described, if no deformation is made below the beta transus temperature, and the cooling 
rate is slow to intermediate, the material solidifies in a lamellar microstructure with α-lamellae 
inside a β-matrix. For high cooling rates the material gets an α’’-martensitic microstructure in β-
grains. If the material is deformed below the beta transus temperature during cooling and 
followed by heating, like in the process for wrought material, the microstructure becomes 
equiaxed with globular α-phase inside a β-matrix. The lamellar structure has lower tensile 
ductility than the equiaxed structure, but has better creep and crack growth resistance 
(Sieniawski et al., 2013). Through various heat treatments and deformation other kinds of 
microstructure can be formed, but in all AM-processes it is the first type with no deformation 
that is interesting and this will be the structure described further. 
When the cooling temperature is higher than 18 ºC/s the material gets a martensitic 
microstructure inside the β-grains, so called α’(α’’)-phase, see Figure 13a. The martensitic 
structure gives a very hard and strong material, but with poor ductility and elongation at fracture. 
When the cooling speed decreases the amount of α’(α’’)-phase decreases and is replaced by α-
phase that gets lamellar shape. For intermediate cooling speeds the α-lamellae is small and is 
positioned in colonies with different lamellae directions creating a basket-weave or 
widmanstätten-structure, see Figure 13b. The α-lamellae (light colour in the pictures) are 
positioned inside a matrix of prior β structure (Dark colour in the pictures). For even lower 
cooling speeds, about 3.5 ºC/s, there are no trace of α’(α’’)-phase and  the α-lamellae is growing 
bigger and in bigger colonies, see Figure 13c. (Sieniawski et al., 2013). 
 
26 
 
 
These specified cooling speeds are based on continuous cooling rate, which can only be achieved 
in very controlled experiments which is normally not the case. It is difficult to control the 
cooling speed in AM-processes since it mainly depends on energy input from the heat source. In 
AM the cooling rate will decrease as the temperature gets lower, and in processes with multiple 
steps like EBM the material goes through a different process so it is not possible to have a 
continuous cooling rate. When using a higher energy input the cooling rate is slower and with a 
lower energy input the cooling is faster. An electric arc has a very high energy input, and laser 
and electron beam is more focused and has a lower energy input (Weman, 2010). The EBM 
material does however go through a different process. The martensitic structure is not stable at 
the elevated temperature of 600-650˚C, so if any martensite has been formed during the cooling 
to the elevated ambient temperature it will transform into α+β phase which are stable in this 
temperature, see TTT-diagram for Ti6Al4V in Figure 14 (Charles, 2008) 
Figure 13: Microstructure in α/β titanium alloys for different cooling speeds (Sieniawski et al., 2013) 
a. 
b. 
c. 
 
27 
 
Figure 14: TTT diagram for Ti6Al4V (Charles, 2008) 
Generally yield stress and ultimate stress of the material are increasing as the α-lamellae is 
getting thinner and the colonies smaller, i.e. faster cooling time. The fracture elongation is 
increasing with a longer cooling time until a certain point where it is getting lower. When 
martensite-structure is achieved the strength is increased radically.  
The martensite phase does also increase the hardness of the material. The difference in hardness 
between martensite and lamellar microstructure is however not as big as the difference between 
martensite and other phases in steel. Normally Ti6Al4V have hardness between 295-390 HV 
(Airbus operations Ltd., 2010). In experiments with SLM, where the dominate phase is 
martensitic, hardness between 380-480 HV have been reached (Thijs et al., 2010) This is only a 
minor raise compared to steel where the hardness can be multiplied several times when 
martensite is formed, but this can still be used as an indicator to control that the phase is not 
martensitic. 
The lamellar structure is stable and cannot be heat treated to get an equiaxed microstructure 
without any pre strain. However, if the AM material is deformed and then heat treated it is 
possible to change the structure. Luca Faccini et al. (2009) studied heat treatment of EBM 
samples from the necking zone at a tensile bar at temperatures around the beta transus 
temperature. It was discovered that there was a gradient where the specimen close to the necking 
zone had fine globular α-phase and gradually gets a coarser microstructure with more α-lamellae 
the further he gets from the necking zone, see Figure 15. The energy stored in the deformed zone 
is enough for the material to recrystallize when the temperature is high enough and the 
microstructure becomes more like in wrought material. It is not possible to deform an entire 
object manufactured in an AM process in such extent so that an equiaxed microstructure can be 
achieved, so there will remain a difference between wrought titanium and AM titanium. 
 
 
28 
 
 
 
 
Cast and AM Ti6Al4V can however be heat treated to improve mechanical properties. One 
common heat treatment is Hot Isostatic Pressure (HIP) where the article is inserted in a furnace 
at a temperature of around 900˚C and an argon pressure of 105 MPa for 2 hours. This treatment 
can close eventual porosity to a certain extent and act stress relieving on the material. HIP do 
mainly increase the fatigue properties of the material (Donachie, 2000) but as seen in Table 2 it 
may also make the material more ductile with reduced strength. Stress relief is in normal 
application done below the HIP temperature, 704-843˚C for 2 hours. For material with low 
amount of residual stresses this treatment will normally not have any great impact of the material 
properties. A common heat treatment with purpose to improve strength is Solution Treatment 
and Ageing (STA) where the material is heated to around 954˚C for 1 hour, followed by fan 
cooling with inert gas and ageing at a temperature of 621˚C for 2 hours. This is done to reduce 
grain boundary alpha and make the lamellae structure finer with smaller colonies (Donachie, 
2000). As mentioned above this will improve the strength of the material if the heat treatment is 
applicable. 
2.5 Welding of Ti6Al4V 
Since the size often is limited in AM it is necessary to weld multiple parts together in many 
cases. This is especially important when using powder bed processes since they limit the size the 
most, but when building larger parts it is also necessary to use welding for the other processes. 
In annealed state Ti6Al4V have good weldability. Weldability is a notation to determine if the 
material can be welded without getting defects like porosity, cracks and sensibility or reduced 
mechanical properties in the welding zone with respect to the parent material. The weldability is 
determined by the chemical composition of the material and the state of the material.  
In STA state the material loose some of the weldability because the STA treatment is destroyed 
in the welding zone and will get less good mechanical properties. 
The chemical composition of the material should fulfill standards for Ti6Al4V to have good 
weldability. Specifications from AMS 4911 are listed in Table 6.

Titanium is specifically sensitive for oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen. The materials high affinity 
to oxygen and nitrogen makes it necessary to protect material with temperature higher than 520 
°C. Therefore the welding has to be made in a shied gas atmosphere, like a weld box filled with 
argon gas. To high amount of oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen increases the strength of the 
material but makes the material brittle with poor fracture elongation. High content of hydrogen 
does also cause porosity in the joint. Contamination during welding appears as change of color 
from silver grey to light straw color. For unacceptable rates of contamination the color changes 
to dark straw, dark blue, light blue, gray and white in current order. It is also possible to see the 
welding arc changing from white yellow when high rates of contamination is present (Mathers, 
2014).

3  PROCESS 
In this chapter the working process is described. A structured process is often called a method 
and its purpose is to help the researcher/developer/designer to reach the goals for the project. 
3.1 Selection of AM-technique 
The different systems have been described and classified. Each method has benefits and 
drawbacks and the interesting aspects have been lifted. To select which methods are most 
interesting they have to be rated against each other for the different aspects. For this a concept 
selection matrix is used. The different aspects are rated in order of importance for SAAB 
aeronautics systems and structure parts. The rating is made by valuating each aspect in percent of 
the overall performance, giving 100 % for the sum of value of all aspects. Based on the fact 
presented in previous chapter the performance for each AM method in the different aspects is 
rated from 1-5. The rating of the AM methods performance in each aspect is multiplied with the 
aspect importance and then summarized giving an overall performance (1-5) for the AM method. 
With this tool the suitability of the different AM methods for SAAB can be rated with a 
scientific approach (Baker, 2010) 
A list of advantages and disadvantages for each method is also developed to help when selecting 
a method. 
3.2 Material investigation 
The available material samples are EBM material from an Arcam machine and wire fed plasma 
arc direct metal deposition material from Norsk Titanium (NTiC), both in the material Ti6Al4V. 
The samples made with Arcam equipment was manufactured and delivered by Supplier 1 by 
request of SAAB. Supplier 1 is a company that has Arcam machines in which they produce parts 
for the industry and are promoted to advance users. That means that they are free to adjust the 
parameters on their own to make research in the area of study. The specimen was made out of 
Ti6Al4V ELI powder, but the solid parts have chemical composition like ordinary Ti6Al4V 
material. The Arcam specimen collection consists of flat plates for bearing strength test with the 
dimensions 75x30x1.5 mm, thin bars for shear strength test with the dimension Ø6.36x86 mm, 
cylinders for compression test with the dimension Ø12x24.5 mm and standard tensile strength 
bars with a small cutoff cylinder with dimensions Ø12x12 mm. The plates, the shear test 
specimen and the compression test cylinders are made in one build, and the tensile strength bars 
are made in the other build, see Figure 16 and Figure 17. All parts are made in vertical position, 
horizontal position and 45 degree position. The machine used for this is reported to have a 
building chamber with the size 210x210x350 mm, which means that it probably is an Arcam A2 
machine. The layer thickness used was 50 µm and other parameters are unknown. All specimens 
are in as-built condition in the sense that no post heat treatment has been done. Machining has 
been made at the specimens but it will not affect the microstructure, hardness or weldability 
assuming that the material only reached moderate temperatures (Kahlin, 2014).

The Norsk Titanium test specimen consists of samples from a parameter study by Norsk 
Titanium. One rectangular bar that is in as built condition and one that is solution treated and 
aged. Both specimens are machined to rectangular rods. The method of the parameter study is 
classed as confidential, but the obtained material from Norsk Titanium is not made with the 
standard parameters. 
 
3.2.1 Measuring surface roughness  
The surface characteristics of as-build material from the EBM method are interesting to 
investigate to determine whether it is necessary with machining or grinding after the printing 
process or not. The material from Norsk Titanium has to be machined anyway to get the correct 
geometry so the surface roughness for that process is not going to be investigated. 
The specimen for measuring surface roughness consists of the flat plates in Figure 16 that is 
manufactured in three different geometric directions in the powder bed. Five plates is in 
horizontal direction (called XY-1 to XY-5), five in vertical direction (called Z-1 to Z-5) and five 
in 45º direction, see Figure 16. The plates are in as-built condition, i.e. no machining or heat 
treatment has been made. The purpose is to evaluate how the surface roughness depends on the 
geometric position of the surface. 
The plates have in an earlier investigation been tested for bearing strength resulting in a crack 
and a hole on one edge of the plate and marks from fixture in the other edge. Therefore the 
surface roughness is measured on the middle of the plate that is undamaged.  
 
33 
The measuring equipment is a portable Perthometer M3A from Perthen and the testing is 
performed at SAAB in Linköping. The machine measures the surface roughness with a small 
needle that moves across the surface. The machine measures the profile of a few millimeters and 
delivers the Ra-value of the surface with a dial indicator which was visually read when the 
measurement was finished. The specimen is measured both along the length of the plate and 
along the width. Each specimen is measured three times in each direction on different spots and a 
mean value is calculated. The procedure is repeated for both sides of the plate except for the 
horizontal plates which had a rectangular pattern from the manufacturing at the back. Three 
plates were investigated for horizontal and vertical direction and five plates for the 45º direction. 
To see the texture of the surface and verify the measured data it is also investigated in 
microscope. For this the samples from the welding test is used and the microscope samples are 
made together with the other microscope samples in the following microscope study. 
 
3.2.2 Welding of EBM material 
Since the building size is limited in AM it is important that the material is possible to weld after 
the printing process so that larger articles can be manufactured. Ti6Al4V have good weldability 
in annealed condition, but it is important to make sure that the material is still weld able after the 
AM process. As mentioned the weldability of the material depends preliminary on the chemical 
composition. The material testing laboratory Exova, in Linköping, have analysed the chemical 
content of the EBM-material from Supplier 1 (Kahlin, 2014). The analysed content is compared 
against the composition specification in AMS 4911 (AMS, 2003). The result is seen in Table 7.

The powder was ELI material, but the chemical analysis shows that the oxygen content is too 
high even for normal Ti6Al4V material. Titanium is especially sensitive to oxygen so this might 
be a problem in the welding tests. Ti6Al4V have good weldability in its annealed condition and 
more limited weldability in STA condition, and since the material in this investigation is in as-
built condition from the EBM process it should have weldability similar to annealed material. 
The material delivered by Supplier 1 made in Arcam equipment is tested for welding by an 
authorized welder at SAAB who has experience to weld in regular Ti6Al4V. The welding is 
performed in an Argon filled box with TIG-welding equipment. The material is the plates Z-4 
and Z-5 that were made together with the plates for the surface roughness measurements see 
Figure 16. Z-4 and Z-5 are two of the five vertical plates in the picture. The thickness of the 
plates is 1.6 mm and the lengths of the welds are 74 respectively 63 mm. The plates have been 
tested for bearing strength in a previous study and have a large crack as a consequence. However 
approximately 80 % of the plates is assumed to be undamaged.  
Before the welding the material has been cleaned to get rid of dirt with elements that might cause 
impurities in the material when melted. The welding is performed in a metal box filled with 
argon gas and with manual TIG-welding equipment without pre-heating. A metal fixture is used 
 
34 
to prevent deformation during welding. The two plates are fused with a butt weld along the long 
side. Then the sides of the plates are cut to two thinner plates. Leaving approximately 6 mm at 
each side of the weld string resulted in two new plates with the width 18 mm. These two plates 
are then welded with a butt weld by the same procedure. After the welding the two joints are 
scanned with X-ray equipment at SAAB to seek for welding defects. 
The welds are then cut and investigated in the microscope study together with the other material 
samples. Three cross sections are investigated for each weld. Joint 1 has a length of 63 mm and 
is cut 10 mm, 29 mm and 40 mm from the start point of the weld. Joint 2 has a length of 73 mm 
and is cut 22 mm, 44 mm and 65 mm from the start point. The cross sections of the joints are 
prepared for microscope study together with the other material samples at KTH. 
 
3.2.3 Microscope study 
Material samples from two different techniques have been collected, Arcams EBM technique 
and Norsk Titaniums wire feed plasma arc DMD. These will be investigated in microscope to 
distinguish differences in microstructure and to see if this conforms to the theory about 
microstructure correlation with the mechanical properties. The sample preparation and 
microscope study is performed at the material department at KTH, Stockholm. 
The EBM material in the microscope investigation has previously been tested at Exova for 
SAAB (Kahlin, 2014) and the wire feed plasma arc DMD samples have been tested by Norsk 
Titanium. The test data from Norsk Titanium is classed as confidential, so the reference will be 
set to typically material properties that are non-confidential and presented in Table 2. From the 
material test the EBM material seems to have higher strength but lower elongation at fracture 
compared to similar tests for EBM – Ti6Al4V in Table 2, see Table 8 for test data from Exova. 
The obtained EBM material does also have a higher strength than typical NTiC material.

Both methods is expected to deliver material with lamellar microstructure because of relatively 
slow cooling, the electron beam uses elevated working temperature and NTiC have a very high 
energy input in the process. Since the Arcam samples shows higher strength in the material 
investigation it is expected that the α-lamellae is thinner and divided in smaller colonies. This 
would conform to the theory of increased strength with a finer microstructure. 
To compare these two techniques microscope surfaces needs to be prepared for the X-, Y- and Z-
direction. The Arcam samples are already prepared for this. The vertical samples provide a good 
look at the XY-plane. The horizontal samples provide a good look at the YZ or XZ plane. In the

printing process the electron beam follows an optimized pattern that is unknown and therefore it 
is assumed that the material properties are the same in both X and Y direction. There might 
however be anisotropy in the microstructure with respect to the Z-direction which is the building 
direction.  
The Norsk Titanium samples need to be cut to the right pieces. X, Y and Z position is marked on 
the samples. For the Norsk Titanium specimen all planes will be investigated, XY, YZ and XZ 
for both as-built material and solution treated and aged material (STA). The string deposition 
direction might be revealed in the microscope study. The samples are cut manually with a 
Discotom. 
The material investigation is made in two sets. In the first set one sample from each direction in 
the NTiC material for both the as-built and STA samples is investigated together with Arcam 
samples for the vertical and horizontal surface. In the second investigation two other tensile 
cylinders from Arcam are investigated together with shear test bars that have a smaller diameter. 
The second approach did also include investigation of three cross sections from each butt weld 
and a new sample of NTiC XY in as-build condition because of previous failure in the sample 
preparation. This result in a total of 21 samples, in 15 pellets, see Table 9 for the list of samples.

The specimen is prepared for grinding with a capsulation machine to create pellets with Bakelite 
for the samples. Then the samples are manually grinded on a rotating plate with water and 
grinding paper. The roughnesses of the paper used are 80, 240, 320, 600, 1200, 2500, 4000 in 
that order. The specimen is then polished automatically for 10 minutes in a PowerPro 5000 with 
Master Met Colloidal Silica Polishing suspension and then etched with 15% HF, 15% HNO3 and 
60% Glycerin for about 10-15 seconds. The samples are then analyzed with a light optic 
microscope with magnifications 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000. 
 
 
36 
3.2.4 Hardness measurement 
After the microscope study it was discovered that the EBM-samples looked a bit different from 
each other. The vertical and the horizontal view planes appear different, and there was also a 
suspicion of differences between the Arcam XY10 sample and the Arcam XY11 sample that 
have been made at the same time with the same conditions. To check if there are any differences 
in the EBM-samples a hardness measurement study is done. The purpose of the hardness 
measurement is to investigate if any of the samples have a higher hardness than the others, which 
would indicate that there are martensitic phase in the material. 
The hardness measurements are done at SAAB in Linköping by a work shop employee. The 
machine is a manually operated AJMYP and measure Vickers hardness HV5. Only one 
measurement in random location is made for each sample. The study is mainly focusing on the 
EBM samples since this is where differences in the micro structure were observed, but two NTiC 
samples are tested as a reference. Results of the examination is shown in Arcam XY10, Arcam 
XY11, Arcam Z10, Arcam Z15, Arcam 1XY yta, Arcam ZA yta, NTiC XY as-built and NTiC 
XY STA.

The concept that scored highest was the powder bed process selective laser melting closely 
followed by electron beam melting. At third place is Laser based powder deposition and after 
that Norsk Titaniums and Sciakys wire based techniques scored pretty similar. Worth to mention 
is that there are other aspects that are difficult to measure, or not enough information has been 
found, that also are important when choosing a process. One example is the price of a finished 
article. This is very dependent on the geometry and requirements of the article, and therefore 
very difficult to value in an overall perspective.  Another example is that the EBM process has a 
lower amount of residual stresses than the other methods which is valuable but difficult to put a 
number on. The idea is that the concept selection matrix should be used together with the list of 
advantages and disadvantages to also be able to consider specific features in the different 
techniques. 
4.2 Material investigation 
The results from the material investigations are presented in respectively section.

It is observed that the surface finish is smooth in the horizontal direction, but rough in the other 
directions. This conforms to the visual inspection of the specimen, however when visually 
inspected the 45 degree sample seems to be more rough than the Z-sample while the 
measurements do only prove a small difference between the two populations. The measurements 
can only show an indication that the 45 degree sample is rougher but not with statistical 
significance. The 45 degree plates have a staircase shape where the different layers can be 
distinguished. The layers can also be seen in the Z-plates as small lines, but there is no staircase 
shape since it was built vertically. In the measurements on the long side the probe crosses the 
layers and gives a higher roughness than when measuring on the short side when the probe 
optimally moves in between two layers. However, in this study the measurements was not 
optimally controlled and the probe did probably cross layers even when measuring along the 
short side.  
The Z plates looked the same on the front- and backside. The 45 degree plates had a pattern on 
the back side from a support structure which gave a less rough surface which is not representable 
for the manufacturing method. The XY plates had a very rough pattern from support structure 
which was not possible to measure.  
In the microscope study of the welded plates it is possible to see the surface texture from the 
cross section. The welds were done at the Z-plates that were made vertically in the building 
chamber, and the welds were cut along the short side giving a cross section of the XY-plane. The 
visible surface is therefore the Z-plates at the short side which was measured to a mean value of 
just below 50 µm. In the microscope it is revealed that there is unmolten powder at the surface 
and that span between the peaks and the valleys is around 150 µm in an observed length of 1.6 
mm, see Figure 18. This is the estimated Rt-value of the surface, but the Ra-value is an 
arithmetic average of absolute values from a virtual middle line of the surface profile. It means 
that is the Rt-value is 150 µm the maximum possible Ra-value would be 75 µm, but since the 
profile do not only have peaks and valleys the Ra-value is certainly lower and the measured Ra-
value of 50 µm seems to be reasonable to this surface profile.

4.2.2 Welding of EBM material 
Observations from the first butt weld (Joint 2): 
 The material melts very easy according to the welder. This could be explained by the 
porous surface layer  
 Spot welds in each ends with filler material was not a problem. However, when making 
spot welds in the middle of the joint without filler material they cracked when 
solidification. This does not usually occur for wrought Ti6Al4V according to the welder.  
 The welder starts carefully with a small melt pool which results in a root defect in the 
first part of the joint. When he increased the welding current from about 35 A to about 40 
A for a bigger melt pool the rest of the joint was made without visible defects. (Note. The 
welding current is regulated by the welder with a pedal and suitable welding current 
depend on welding technique and welding speed)  
 The arc is considered to have yellow colour which indicates that there is a presence of 
impurities. A possible cause is insufficient cleaning of the material or the slightly 
elevated oxygen content in the material. As a reference, regular titanium is welded in the 
argon filled box and the arc is having more of a blue/white colour with just a little 
yellow.  
 A few millimetres outside the weld bead the colour of the material is shifting from silver 
grey to light yellow during the welding. This indicates presence of impurities like 
oxygen. Since the material is not coloured in the weld but closer to the fixture the welder 
thinks that it is caused by the dirt on the fixture and not because of impurities in the 
material. The light yellow colour indicates only a small amount of impurities and is 
accepted when welding. (Reference: Titanium with low content of impurities keeps its 
silver grey colour when TIG-welded with sufficient shielding gas) 
After the welding both joints were x-rayed to seek for defects. Circular subsurface pores were 
found in both joints, especially along the sides of the joint. There are 10-30 pores per joint and 
the size of the pores is estimated to a few hundred microns. In Joint 1 there was also tungsten 
contamination from the electrode found and the known root error in joint 2 is seen to the left in 
Figure 19.

The porosity of the welds is estimated to be less than 1 % according to reference in SS-ISO 
5817, which is a small amount of porosity, but in some regions the pores are as closely located 
so that they might qualify as linear porosity which lower the quality of the weld.  
 
4.2.3 Microscope study 
The macrostructure of the EBM samples showed very fine globular grains in the horizontal XY 
plane, see Figure 20 a and b. In the vertical plane (XZ or YZ) the grains were elongated in the 
building direction. This means that the grains have a columnar shape and spans over multiple 
layers. The same phenomenon was observed in the Wire fed plasma arc direct metal deposition 
samples. Here both the XZ- and YZ-plane was investigated and both showed elongated grains in 
the building direction and spanned over the layers. The horizontal XY-plane showed globular 
grains with no distinct difference in the X and Y direction, which means that these grains have 
columnar shape as well. The NTiC samples have much bigger grains than the EBM samples in 
the as-built condition, and after STA treatment of the NTiC samples the grain size is even bigger. 
The different pictures in Figure 20 are not in actual size but they are approximately made to scale 
to each other.  
 
 
 
Porosity was found in the Arcam XY-10 sample, i.e. on the sample providing a view of the XZ- 
or YZ-plane. When looking at the surface with low magnification elongated pores between the 
layers could be observed. The pores had a size of up to 300 μm long and were very thin, see 
Figure 21. It is easily concluded that there are lack of fusion between the layers that have caused 
this porosity since it is possible to distinguish the layers between the pores.

Figure 21: Porosity in the Arcam XY10 sample 
Porosity of the same kind was found in the thin bars from Supplier 1, but in a much greater 
extent, see Figure 22. The XY 1 cm and AZ 1 cm samples was made because of the large 
porosity in the XY yta and AZ yta samples, to see if the porosity was present in the whole bar. It 
turned out to be almost as much porosity 1 cm from the top as by the top.  
 
 
Figure 22: Porosity in Arcam 1XY 1 cm reveals building direction 
In the samples with much porosity the pores were gathered around a specific area of the cross 
section, see Figure 23. Based on the direction of the columnar grains it is possible that the pores 
are gathered around either the bottom or the top of the Arcam samples that were built in 
horizontal position. The horizontally built shear test bar, Arcam 1XY, had areas where there was 
a lot of porosity that is marked in Figure 23 c and d. There was however porosity in the whole 
cross section, which was not the case for the thicker bars, Arcam XY10 and Arcam XY11. Also 
in the vertically built thin bar Arcam AZ it was possible to see areas with large porosity, see 
Figure 23 d, but with more circular pores since the XY-plane does not provide a view over 
multiple layers. The local increase of porosity at similar position in multiple samples indicates a 
systematic problem to create full density in certain geometries, or certain positions in the 
building chamber. 
When looking at the porosity in the Arcam 1XY 1 cm sample some grains are partially melted 
from the left side of the picture, see Figure 22. This indicates that the energy source have been 
 
44 
directed from the side where the grains are partially melted, which would mean that the porosity 
have occurred in the lower part of the object seen to the position in the building chamber. Similar 
phenomenon is visible in the porosity in the Arcam 1XY yta sample, see Appendix B. A 
hypothesis is that this is the case for the other horizontally built EBM pieces which would mean 
that there is a problem with getting full density in the lower sections of the object for this 
geometry.

The microstructure in the NTiC samples showed lamellar microstructure. In the as-built 
condition there was very small amount of β-phase between the α-lamellae. In the STA condition 
the amount of β-phase was increased and the lamellae were more separated, see Figure 24. The 
thickness of the lamellae is also estimated to be slightly larger. This is a consequence of the 
solution annealing process which increases the amount of β-phase and provided better ductility 
and a small increase of strength to the material.

The EBM material has a much finer microstructure. The lamellae are thinner and shorter and the 
lamellae colonies appear to be smaller. It seems to be a difference in the surface orientation, see 
Figure 25. In the Arcam Z10 sample that provides a view over the XY-plane the structure is 
rougher than the one in the Arcam XY11 sample that gives a view over the vertical plane (XZ- 
or YZ-plane). The EBM material have a so called acicular alpha structure, which means that the 
α-phase are more shaped like needles than plates that is the case in NTiC’s material. In the 
Arcam XY11 sample there are regions where lamellae cannot be distinguished, and that is 
because that colony is directed perpendicular to the view plane. Worth to mention is that the 
pictures are taken from two different samples that had different orientation in the same building 
chamber. In Figure 25a it is also possible to see a round pore with an diameter of less than 20 
µm. This is most probably a remaining of a pore inside a powder grain from the gas atomization 
process.

In the welded material it is observed that the grains have grown from very small grains in the 
parent material to gradually bigger grains in the heat affected zone as it gets closer to weld bead. 
The heat affected zone is approximately 14-15 mm when including the weld bead and it is seen 
as a change of colour after etching, see Figure 26.

The microstructure have changed from a characteristic lamellar Arcam microstructure in the 
parent material, Figure 27a, to a more rough microstructure in the weld bead, Figure 27b, similar 
to the one found in the NTiC material. The microstructure in the heat affected zone looked more 
like the microstructure in the weld bead than in the parent material.

4.2.4 Hardness measurement 
No distinct difference is discovered between the different samples. All measurements were in the 
interval 341 – 362 HV based on one measurement for each sample, see Table 13. According to 
Airbus process specification ABP 6-5226 the Vickers hardness of Ti6Al4V plate in annealed 
condition should be 295-390 HV (Airbus operations Ltd, 2010), which covers the measured 
hardness values.

As previously mentioned, when Thijs el al. (2010) measured martensitic Ti6Al4V samples 
produced with SLM they achieved hardness values between 380-480 HV. This hardness 
measurement does not indicate that there would be any martensite in the tested material.

5  DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
A discussion of the results and the conclusions that the authors have drawn during the Master of 
Science thesis are presented in this chapter. The conclusions are based from the analysis with 
the intention to answer the formulation of questions that is presented in Chapter 1.  
5.1 Discussion 
A detailed literature study has been made about the field of Additive Manufacturing, followed by 
material study of two different AM techniques. In this chapter the significance of the result is 
analysed in perspective of reliability and consequences. 
5.1.1 Source criticism in literature study 
Many of the sources in the literature study consist of data sheets from the manufacturer. These 
data sheets can sometimes overestimate the potential of the machine when it comes to building 
speeds and precision in order to enhance the expectations of the machine. It is possible that the 
building speed that the manufacturers are marketing is not practically achievable because of 
quality issues, like lack of fusion as a consequence of insufficient heat input. Also the 
mechanical properties and material quality that the machine manufacturer presents should be 
carefully trusted. This thesis have proven several examples why it is a good idea that the own 
company carefully study the material before making a decision to use it in a product. 
 
5.1.2 Surface roughness 
The surface roughness measurements proved that the horizontal surface for Arcams EBM 
material have a relatively smooth surface, around Ra 12, while the vertical and 45 degree 
surfaces are rough, Ra 55-60. The measurements of the 45 degree surface and the vertical surface 
showed that the surfaces have almost the same Ra values, mean values of Ra 59.4 respectively 
Ra 54.7 with standard deviations that are overlapping each other’s mean value. When visually 
inspected the 45 degree surface seems to be rougher than the vertical surface which do not really 
conform to the measured values. One possible error is that the testing equipment is not made for 
measuring such rough surfaces since it is not normally used. 
The big difference in surface roughness needs to be taken into account when manufacturing 
articles in Arcams EBM-machines. A complete article made with EBM will have a smooth 
surface of about Ra 10-20 on horizontal surfaces and a very rough surface in all other positions. 
Vertical surfaces seem to be a little bit smoother than inclined surfaces, but the difference is 
small. The surface is a bit striped (staircase shaped) as a consequence of the width of the electron 
beam melt pool. When measuring inside a staircase step the surface is a bit smoother.  
If there is a specification of surface roughness for the article it is probably necessary to use 
blasting, grinding or machining to meet the specifications since there is such a big spread of the 
roughness for different positions. 
 
5.1.3 Welding test 
The expectations were that the weldability of the EBM material should be as good as for 
wrought Ti6Al4V, but that there was a risk that the oxygen content in these specific samples was 
too high. The yellow arc showed indications that there might be a higher content of impurities 
than normal. There was however no colour on the weld bead that indicated that the joint should 
have a lower quality than the parent material. One explanation to the yellow arc could be the 
 
50 
rough surface of the plates. Before the weld test the plates was sent for cleaning to remove dirt 
from the surface. The rough surface of the plates might have complicated the cleaning and left 
dirt in the surface that disturbed the welding process. In that case the material might be suitable 
for welding, but not the current plate configuration. It might be necessary to blast or grind the 
surface in the edges before welding to minimize the risk of getting high amount of unwanted 
elements like oxygen on the material. To find out if the high oxygen content in the material has 
caused any brittleness the weld has to be mechanically tested with for example a tensile test. It 
should be possible to discover a lower fracture elongation in the welding zone if the high oxygen 
content has caused brittleness in the joint. 
The X-ray showed some sporadic pores in the weld bead. They are located close to the border 
between the weld bead and the heat affected zone. This phenomenon increases the risk of linear 
porosity which decreases the quality of the joint. Why the pores have occurred in this region is 
unknown. According to the literature study the major cause of porosity is high nitrogen content 
in the material. In this case the nitrogen content was much lower than the limits (0.0005 wt% H 
>> 0.015 wt%) so it is unlikely that the porosity have occurred because of the chemical 
composition in the parent material. The extent of the porosity was however not alarming so the 
weldability of the material is still expected to be good, but more investigations have to be made 
to be certain about that.  
 
5.1.4 Microscope study 
The lamellar microstructure in AM-material is different from the equiaxed microstructure in 
wrought material and the only way to achieve similar structure is to deform the AM-material and 
heat treat it. As mentioned, the lamellar microstructure does not have as good ductility and 
strength, which is a major drawback for all AM techniques.  
Previous experiments shows that the thickness of the α-phase lamellae and the colony size have a 
direct connection to the material strength. Thinner lamellae and smaller colonies provide a 
material with higher strength. This conforms to the result from this investigation since the Arcam 
material is stronger than the NTiC material and has thinner lamellae.  
The cause of the differences in the Arcam material and the NTiC material is the different thermal 
processes in the printing process. Even though the Arcam process runs with an elevated working 
temperature, the NTiC process runs with a higher energy input. The Arcam material is only very 
locally melted and do rapidly cool off to the 600-650 ˚C that is the ambient temperature. At this 
temperature the lamellar microstructure is stable and the grains do not grow over time. The 
cooling through the microstructure formation temperature zone is therefore fast compared to the 
NTiC process where the melt pool is a lot bigger and has a slower cooling. A slower cooling 
gives a rougher microstructure and a material with lower strength. The microstructure in the 
EBM material has not only thinner lamellae, but also got a small principle difference in the shape 
of the α-phase. From the more plate like lamellae in the NTiC samples, the lamellae in the EBM 
material have more of a needle shape and are called acicular alpha. This is a consequence of the 
more rapid cooling and provides a stronger material. 
When the Arcam material was welded, the cooling was slower than in the printing process, 
because of higher energy input and thin material, and the microstructure became rougher and 
looked similar to the one in the NTiC material. The prior β-grains had also been growing in the 
heat affected zone because of the high temperature in the welding process. The material has most 
certainly got different mechanical properties in the weld and it should be heat treated to 
homogenize the material before use. 
Porosity in the shape of lack of fusion between the layers was found in 6 out of 8 samples in the 
Arcam EBM material from Supplier 1 (not including the welded plates), but no porosity was 
found in the 7 samples from NTiC. Even though the EBM samples showed better strength and 
 
51 
fracture elongation the quality of the NTiC samples seems to be better in this specific set of 
materials. Specifically it seems as the thin bars had much more porosity than the thicker bars, 
which might indicate that the porosity depends on the geometry which might cause problem 
when manufacturing thin walled articles that are common in the aerospace industry. No post-
treatment such as HIP have been made on the EBM samples, so it is possible that some of the 
pores can be closed with HIP since there should be vacuum inside as a result of the production 
environment in EBM.  
The porosity in the horizontally built EBM material concentrated to one side each sample that 
was examined. In the Arcam 1XY 1 cm case it was discovered that the porosity was positioned 
in the lower part of the object, seen to the position in the building chamber. If this is the case for 
all other samples as well there might be a systematic problem to achieve full density for circular 
cross sections. This would limit the design flexibility of the process because of poor quality. No 
other sources indicates that this should be a problem with EBM so further investigations should 
been made to see if this is a problem for this specific batch or if Supplier 1 generally have this 
problem.  
According to Ackelid (2014) possible causes of the lack of fusion are bad focus calibration of the 
electron beam, bad parameters of beam current and scan speed, bad parameters of powder 
deposition, powder with to high content of contamination or insufficient support structure. In this 
case the high oxygen content in the material (0.24 wt% O > 0.20wt%) might be the cause of the 
lack of fusion between the layers. Same as for welding with titanium high oxygen content in the 
material gives the material different melting properties that are not suitable for the customized 
parameters in the EBM building process. Another possible cause is insufficient support structure 
since the large porosity occurred in specific areas close to undercuts. If undercuts are not 
sufficiently supported it is possible that the layer is not plain enough which causes problem when 
the next layer should be fused. However, since the building parameters are unknown the cause of 
the lack of fusion cannot be decided. 
 
5.1.5 Hardness measurements 
The hardness measurements were only meant as a complement to the microscope study to see if 
there were differences in the EBM samples. Questions were raised if martensite existed in the 
Arcam XY10 sample. If so the hardness of the surface should be harder than the 295-390 HV 
that the Airbus standard ABP 6-5226 regulates (Airbus operations Ltd, 2010). The hardness 
measurement can however not be used as a tool to exclude presence of martensite. The 
martensitic structure can occur in regions and still be enough to decrease the mechanical 
properties in the material. If the hardness is not measured in the specific region the increased 
hardness will not be discovered. The hardness measurement test is therefore not a good method 
to control that no martensite is present in the AM material. 
 
5.1.6 Defects in the EBM material 
The quality of the EBM material delivered by Supplier 1 passed most of the static mechanical 
testing by Exova, but the material have a lot of porosity in a large part of the samples 
investigated.  
The EBM material that was investigated in this study was made in an Arcam A2 machine that 
was released in 2007. New machines, that should provide material with better quality, have been 
released since then which means that the machine that was used for this study is not the latest 
technology from Arcam. Additive manufacturing is a field of technology where a lot of progress 
has been made the last few years and it is possible that the newer machines perform better than 
 
52 
the older Arcam A2. According to several sources and expert opinions it should be possible to 
create EBM material without lack of fusion between the layers in Arcam equipment. 
The most probable reason is however that Supplier 1 has run the production with poor 
parameters, like too high scan speed, and did not achieve melting temperature everywhere so that 
the layers did not fuse sufficiently. 
5.2 Conclusions 
 Based on study of previous investigation and the investigations performed in this thesis it 
is certain that the material made with AM is different from wrought material. The 
difference lies in the microstructure. When considering Ti6Al4V wrought material have a 
globular microstructure, while AM material has a lamellar microstructure like cast 
material. The AM material does generally lower strength and ductility than wrought 
material, but it does still fulfill the requirements when rightly produced. 
 According to the concept selection matrix based on the literature study Selective Laser 
Melting is the most suitable technique. For that reason it is a technique worth 
investigating. Laser gives martensite phase in the microstructure which is a stronger and 
more brittle structure than the lamellar structure found in the EBM and Norsk Titanium 
material. The precision and surface finish is however better and after an annealing 
process, the material might have acceptable ductility. 
 Even though there are several different techniques for Additive Manufacturing, only a 
few can use the full potential of the field of study. The powder bed processes delivers 
most design freedom and material savings, but are limited by small building chambers. 
The material deposition processes can build bigger objects, but requires more machining 
and do not provide any more design freedom than conventional manufacturing. 
 EBM and arc based processes is possible to use without following heat treatment for non-
fatigue loaded components, while laser based processes have to be heat treated to get rid 
of the brittle phase due to rapid cooling. For fatigue loaded articles EBM material do 
probably need HIP treatment.  
 Surface roughness of EBM articles vary depending on the surface location. Horizontally 
surfaces have Ra value around 10-20 µm while vertically and tilted surfaces can have 
surface as rough as Ra 60 µm because of unmolten powder. Surfaces do consequently 
have to be grinded if there is a requirement for surface roughness. 
 Norsk Titanium delivers Ti6Al4V material without defects in any cross section that was 
investigated in this study. The material was delivered from the machine source. 
 The Arcam A2 machine at Supplier 1 has delivered Ti6Al4V material with porosity. 
Supplier 1 is an advanced user of the Arcam machines that are allowed to use other 
settings than the recommended from the machine source. The pores are mostly visible in 
a vertical plane (XZ- or YZ-plane seen to the building chamber) and are located in 
unmolten regions between the layers with sizes of at least up to 300 µm in length and 
with a very small width. The porosity is often gathered around specific areas. A comment 
from the machine deliverer is that the process should not give any elongated porosity if 
everything is operated properly with all the right parameters and raw material, but a few 
spherical pores (<100 µm) is common as a remain from the gas atomization process. 
 The EBM material delivered by Supplier 1 has an oxygen content that exceeds the 
permitted in AMS 4911 (0.24 wt% O > 0.20wt%). 
 
53 
 The microstructure varies in different AM methods because of the different thermal 
processes. In Ti6Al4V laser based methods do often contain α’’-martensite in prior β-
grains in the as built condition. Arc based processes have a lamellar α phase in a β-
matrix, similar to the microstructure after arc welding because of the high energy input. 
EBM have a finer microstructure than the arc based methods but no martensite phase 
because of rapid cooling but with elevated working temperature. The microstructure 
achieved in the EBM process is called acicular α in prior β grains.

6  RECOMMENDATIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In this chapter, recommendations on more detailed solutions and/or future work in this field are 
presented.  
6.1 Recommendations 
To be able to utilize all the benefits with AM a powder bed process is recommended. The 
powder bed processes provides design freedoms that the other AM techniques cannot achieve. 
New designs that is only possible to create in a powder bed have potential to reduce the number 
of parts and joints in the product which can make a big difference if AM is used in large scale. 
When the technology become more familiar to the company and is introduced in the 
development of new articles it can also be used to increase the functionality of the articles, like 
integrated cooling canals in articles suffering from high heating, which might increase the 
performance of the product. 
For the NTiC process the part is built on a plate of the same material as the deposited. In the 
EBM process by Arcam it is however a stainless steel plate in the bottom, and even though it 
gets loose by itself the layers closest to the bottom might be contaminated when using another 
material. When building a Ti6Al4V article with EBM it has to be certain that the bottom layer is 
not contaminated from the steel palate, either by take this into account and build a layer that 
should be removed after delivery, of by specifying to build on support structure and not on the 
bottom plate. To build on the bottom plate do however been proved to be beneficial for the 
similar SLM processes when concerning geometrical tolerances, so there might be advantages to 
build the article rigidly attached to be bottom plate and machine the bottom after. 
For EBM material it seems like it is possible to get a lot of porosity in the material under certain 
circumstances. Test for controlling the quality of the material. Don’t change supplier without 
controlling the material. HIP is also recommended for all EBM articles, even for low load and 
non-fatigue loaded articles, because of the porosity found in samples. HIP will close the porosity 
and provide a material with higher quality to a relatively low price. 
The surface of the EBM material is very rough for non-horizontal planes. When studying the 
vertically built plates (the Z-plates) it was discovered that unmolten powder are stuck to the 
surface and that the Rt-value of the surface was as rough as 150 µm. The unmolten powder can 
be sand-blasted away after the building process to acceptable levels of surface roughness, but it 
will remove relatively much material. If the plate is measured after the building process it will be 
a few tenths of a millimeter thinner after it has been sand-blasted on both sides which might end 
up with a too thin plate. A recommendation is to specify measurements a little bit larger than 
what is required and to remove material to the right size. Another problem with the rough surface 
is the problem to clean it sufficiently before welding. It might be a good idea to grind the surface 
close to the edges before welding to avoid any contamination in the weld because of surface dirt. 
6.2 Future work 
The EBM equipment should be able to create any shape everywhere in the building chamber 
with the same quality. Since the porosity in the studied sample appeared in specific areas there is 
a reason to believe that it is not entirely true, but to make any conclusions more material samples 
should be investigated. In this investigation it seemed to be more porosity in thing bars than in 
thick bars, and it seemed to be more porosity closely located to undercuts where it is necessary to 
use support structure. By ordering material samples that includes these features and study the 
 
56 
areas that are suspected to be weaker it might be possible to discover the real limits of the 
machine. If discovered that this is a problem for the EBM machine it would be interesting to 
investigate the same for the SLM process to see if it can perform better. 
Study if the porosity in EBM material is bigger for the XY samples than for the Z samples. To 
do this it is necessary to use more sophisticated measuring instruments or to compare them in the 
same view plane. 
The EBM material from Supplier 1 contained porosity of great extent in some samples. HIP 
should be able to close porosity, but it would be interesting to see if all porosity can be removed. 
This should be further investigated, preferable with more sophisticated equipment that can 
measure the density of the material, but also with microscope investigations similar to the ones 
made in this project. 
The EBM material had too high oxygen content according to the analyze by Exova. Since high 
oxygen content cause brittle material, especially when welding, this might be a hazard if there 
are a risk of getting material with high oxygen content from the EBM process. What have to be 
done is to make sure that Supplier 1 continuously can deliver material with low oxygen content 
so that there is no risk of accidentally getting brittle material. The welding of the material does 
also have to be further investigated. Mechanical testing over joints would give information if the 
weldability is as good for AM material as for wrought material. That the material is weld able is 
a presumption for the process to qualify for manufacturing because of the limited building size of 
the machine. 
SLM is an interesting alternative to the AM techniques that have been tested in this project. SLM 
scored well in the concept selection matrix and have as good geometrical capabilities as EBM, 
but with higher precision, better surface finish and possibilities to build larger parts. The 
drawbacks are the need of heat treatment after the printing process because of martensitic 
material and residual stresses. It would be interesting to compare the need of machining after the 
EBM process and the need of heat treatment after the SLM process and compare the quality and 
cost of both methods.

APPENDIX B: Microscope study 
Macrostructure 
It is observed that there are columnar grains in the building direction (Z-direction). The length of 
the grains is estimated to 1-3 mm by measuring with a ruler. The thickness is below 0.5 mm. 
Porosity was discovered in a specific area of the surface.  
 
Figure 28: Arcam XY10 
The same kind of macrostructure is found in the Arcam XY11 sample. Porosity was found in 
similar positions as for the Arcam XY10 sample (see blue markings) 
 
Figure 29: Arcam XY11 
Building 
direction 
 
Area with 
porosity 
 
63 
 
When looking at the XY-plane small globular grains are observed. The grains are estimated to be 
below 0.5 mm in diameter. 
 
Figure 30: Arcam Z15 
The Arcam Z10 sample shows the same kind of macrostructure as Arcam Z15. 
 
Figure 31: Arcam Z10 
 
64 
 
 
In the first attempt to examine the thin bars, Arcam 1XY and Arcam AZ, a cross section close to 
the top of the bars was investigated. The Arcam 1XY yta sample showed fine columnar grains 
and a lot of porosity. The large porosity was concentrated to a specific area (see blue marking). 
The Arcam AZ yta shows fine globular grains.  
 
Figure 32: Left: Arcam 1XY yta. Right: Arcam AZ yta 
Because of the large amount of porosity in the samples close to the surface, another cross section 
1 cm below the top of the bars was examined. There was however almost as much porosity in 
this cross section, and here also the Arcam AZ 1 cm sample showed some porosity (see blue 
markings) 
 
Figure 33: Left: Arxam AZ 1 cm. Right: Arcam 1XY 1 cm 
 
65 
Joint 1 was cut into three cross sections. 10 mm, 29 mm and 46 mm from the start. The welds 
looks good without defects. The heat affected zone is visible and measures between 14 and 15 
mm from side to side in this case. The grain size is small in the parent material and growing in 
the heat affected zone to big grains in the weld bead. 
 
Figure 34: Joint 1. From top to bottom: 10 mm, 29 mm, 46 mm from weld start 
Joint 2 was also cut into three cross sections. The heat affected zone is smaller in the cut at 22 
mm where lower energy input was used and a root defect occurred. The heat affected zone 
measured 12 mm in the first cut and 15 mm in the other two cuts. The grain size is small in the 
parent material and growing in the heat affected zone to big grains in the weld bead. 
 
Figure 35: Joint 2. From top to bottom: 22 mm, 44 mm, 65 mm from weld start 
 
 
66 
 The XY as-built sample failed in the preparation so no good microstructure could be observed. 
It has probably been to high temperature when cutting with the discotome. If occasion is given 
the sample will be grinded in an attempt to reach below the heat affected zone.  
 
Figure 36: NTiC XY as-built 
A new sample was made in the second run. In this surface there are columnar grains, with 
diameter ranging from 1-3 mm. It is also possible to see a border between two strings. This is a 
border between two strings in the same layer since it is the XY-plane that is observed. It is 
possible to distinguish a heat affected zone above the border (light brown color) 
 
Figure 37: NTiC XY2 as-built 
 
 
67 
In the XY STA sample globular grains with a lot larger size than the Arcam material is observed. 
The grains are estimated to be 1-2 mm in diameter. These grains look slightly smaller than the 
ones from the NTiC XY2 as-built sample. 
 
Figure 38: NTiC XY STA 
In the XZ as-built sample the strings can be seen. It can also be observed that there is a heat 
affected zone between each layer (light brown in the picture). The grains are columnar in the 
building direction (Z-direction). The grains are much bigger than the columnar grains in the 
EBM XY-10 sample. The size of the grains is estimated to be 2-4 mm long and have a width of 
up to 1 mm. At the bottom of the sample finer and more globular grains are observed. The reason 
for the change in grain shape is unknown. 
 
Figure 39: NTiC XZ as-built 
 
 
68 
After STA the layers can still be distinguished and the grains are still columnar in the building 
direction. The grains are bigger than in in the as-built XZ-sample. The maximum grain length 
exceeds the specimen height of 7 mm and the thickness differs from below 1 mm up to 2 mm. 
Heat affected zones from the cutting of the sample can be seen in the top and bottom of the 
specimen. 
 
Figure 40: NTiC XZ STA 
The YZ as-built sample reveals a string deposition pattern. From this view it can be concluded 
that the strings are deposited in the X-direction. Heat affected zone between the strings can be 
distinguished (light brown color). The grains are columnar in the building direction. The length 
of the grains is around 2-4 mm and the thickness is up to 1 mm. At the top of the sample there is 
also a heat affected zone from the cutting in the sample preparation. 
 
Figure 41: NTiC YZ as-built 
 
 
 
69 
The grains is somewhat columnar and bigger than the as-built sample. On large grain with the 
size 5x2 mm is observed. The other grains are about 3-4 mm long and 1 mm in width. No string 
border can be distinguished but a heat affected zone from the cutting is observed to the left. 
 
Figure 42: NTiC YZ STA 
 
70 
Microstructure 
The structure is arranged in a Basket weave pattern with fine α-lamellae witch has a width of 1-2 
μm in the lower grain and 2-3 μm in the upper grain. Between the lamellae there is a thin layer of 
β-phase. In the picture there is also a grain border visible. 
 
Figure 43: NTiC XZ as-built  
For the STA-material in the XZ-view there is still the same overall microstructure. The lamellae 
is abou 1.5 to 2.5 μm. There is however a lot more β-phase in between the α-lamellae which 
separates the α-colonies. This should give better mechanical properties and conforms with the 
mechanical testing  
 
Figure 44: NTiC XZ STA 
 
71 
 
This picture shows a string border in the NTiC YZ as-built sample. It is observed that the 
microstructure is not uniform in the string borders. This might be a consequence of a heat 
affected zone in the previous layer when the next layer is deposited. 
 
Figure 45: String border NTiC YZ as-built 
The microstructure in the NTiC YZ as built sample inside the strings looks similar to the 
microstructure in the NTiC XZ as-built sample. The lamellae range from 0.5 to 1.5 μm. 
 
Figure 46: In string 1 NTiC YZ as-built 
 
72 
Between the strings there is a darker part with a different microstructure. Possible presence of α’ 
platelets but it could also be a consequence of etching effects. 
 
Figure 47: In string 2 NTiC YZ as-built 
In the YZ STA sample the same phenomena as for the XZ-view is observed. There is an increase 
of β-phase between the α-lamellae. The lamellae range from 1-2 μm. 
 
Figure 48: NTiC YZ STA 
 
 
73 
The NtiC XY as-built sample was caused by high temperature while cutting for sample 
preparation. The microstructure became irregular and cannot be evaluated. 
 
Figure 49: Lines NTiC XY as-built 
Inside the bright lines in the XY as-built sample a very fine widmanstätten structure is 
discovered. Probably because of rapid heating and cooling in the discotome.  
 
Figure 50: NTiC XY as-built 
 
 
74 
 
The new NTiC XY2 as-built sample was successful. Here the lamellae have a width of around 1-
2 μm and a colony size of about 10-20 μm. 
 
 
Figure 51: NTiC XY2 as-built 
In the NTiC XY STA sample a very coarse basket weave structure is discovered. The α-lamellae 
are between 1-4 μm thick and there is an increased amount of β-phase compared to the NTiC 
XY2 as-built sample. 
 
Figure 52: NTiC XY STA 
 
 
75 
Columnar grains in the building direction for Arcam XY15 as-built sample. 
 
Figure 53: Columnar grains Arcam XY10 
Small globular grains in the Arcam Z15 as-built sample. 
 
Figure 54: Arcam Z15 
 
 
 
76 
When looking at the Arcam XY10 sample with low magnification it is possible to see elongated 
pores in the material. The pores seem to be created by poor melting between the layers. The 
pores have a length of up to 300 μm and are located in a specific area of the cross section close 
to the edge. The layers seem to have a thickness of about 100 μm.  
 
Figure 55: Elonged porosity Arcam XY10 
Arcam XY10-sample (view of the xz or yz plane) has a very fine microstructure. The sample 
preparation appear to not been successful which makes the microstructure difficult to analyse 
further. See microstructure analysis for Arcam XY11 that was made under the same conditions 
and gives a better picture.

In the Arcam Z15 sample (view of the XY-plane) it is possible to distinguish a widmanstätten 
structure with α-lamellae in colonies. The thickness of the lamellae is very small, below 1 μm. It 
is also possible to distinguish grains of different size and shape. It is possible to distinguish 
colonies where the lamellae are oriented in the same direction. The colonies have the size of 
about 10 – 20 μm. See microstructure for Arcam Z10 for a better prepared sample. 
 
Figure 57: Arcam Z15 
Arcam Z10 was made under the same conditions as Arcam Z15. Round grains are observed in 
the XY-plane. 
 
Figure 58: Arcam Z10 
 
78 
The microstructure is lamellar as expected and divided in small colonies inside the grains. The 
lamellae have a thickness of 0.5-3 μm and are positioned in colonies with the size of 10-30 μm. 
 
 
Figure 59: Arcam Z10 
Arcam XY11 was made under the same conditions as Arcam XY10. The vertical plane (XZ or 
YZ) has elongated grains in the building direction. The structure of the α-lamellae is finer than 
what is seen in the Arcam Z10 sample.  
 
 
Figure 60: Arcam XY11

Arcam calls this microstructure “acicular alpha in prior beta grains”, so the α-phase has a shape 
somewhere between a “needle” and a “plate”. The lamellae have a thickness of about 0.5-2 μm 
and are positioned in colonies of around 5-15 μm. 
 
Figure 61: Arcam XY11 
The AZ-sample is made from the same run as the plates where surface roughness was tested. 
Here it is thinner cylinders made for shear tests. The AZ cylinder is made in vertical position. 
The microstructure in the horizontally xy-plane is fine lamellar structure with thickness of 0.5-2 
μm and colony size of 5-15 μm. 
 
Figure 62: Arcam AZ yta

The 1XY sample was made with the AZ sample but in horizontal position. The microstructure in 
the vertical plane is similar to the structure in the vertical plane of the XY11 sample. The 
lamellae are 0.5-1.5 μm thick but the colony size is difficult to estimate from the pictures. 
 
 
Figure 63: Arcam 1XY yta 
The 1XY sample showed very much porosity when looking close to the top of the cylinder. The 
porosity has been caused by bad integration between the layers. The layer thickness seems to 
span from 50 – 100 μm. 
 
 
Figure 64: Arcam 1XY yta 
 
 
81 
When looking at a surface 1 cm from the top of the cylinder it was still very much porosity in the 
vertical plane. The layer thickness seems to span from 50 – 100 μm. Some grains are partially 
melted from the left side of the picture. A hypothesis is that the energy source have been directed 
from the side where the grains are partially melted, which would mean that the porosity have 
occurred in the lower part of the object seen to the position in the building chamber. 
 
 
Figure 65: Arcam 1XY 1 cm 
Also the AZ sample showed porosity when looking at a surface 1 cm from the top of the 
cylinder. The pores have a different shape since it is the XY-plane that is observed. Probably this 
is an area where it is bad fusion between the layers but from a top view.  
 
Figure 66: Arcam AZ 1 cm

It is possible to see the columnar grains in the microstructure of the Arcam 1XY 1 cm sample. 
The microstructure consists of fine lamellae with a thickness of 0.5-1.5 μm and colony size 5-10 
μm. 
 
Figure 67: Arcam 1XY 1 cm 
In the Arcam AZ 1 cm sample the lamellae are about 0.5-1 μm thich and a colony size of 10-15 
μm.

This is a magnification of a vertically positioned Arcam plate seen in the XY-plane 
(perpendicular to the building direction). In the surface unmolten powder is visible which 
explains the rough surface. In this picture the surface differ in a span of around 150 µm.

Welded material 
The following pictures show the welded Arcam plates. It starts with unaffected parent material to 
the left in the first picture (dark zone) and how the grains in HAZ grow from small to larger in 
size as the weld bead approaches.

Figure 74 shows an assembly of Figure 70 to Figure 73 and gives a good view of the grain 
growth in HAZ.

In the parent material the microstructure has a characteristic EBM lamellar microstructure, 
 
Figure 75: Microstructure Joint 1, parent material 
In HAZ and in the weld bead the microstructure is rougher and more similar to the 
microstructure in the NTiC material.
