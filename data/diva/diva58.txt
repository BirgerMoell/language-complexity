Sammanfattning 
ABB är världsledande inom kraft- och automationsteknik och deras lösningar förbättrar 
prestanda och minimerar miljöpåverkan för energiföretag och industrier. ABB FACTS designar 
utrustning och anläggningar för serie- samt faskompensering.  
 
Detta examensarbete har utförts på ABB FACTS på avdelningen Mechanical Design (DM) i 
Västerås. Syftet med projektet var att ta fram beräknings- och simuleringsverktyg för plattformar 
som används av ABB FACTS i deras seriekompenseringsanläggningar. Examensarbetet har även 
fungerat som en utvärdering av FEM programmet SolidWorks Simulation. 
 
Examensarbetet inleddes med en förstudie där de normer och standarder som ABB FACTS 
måste ha i åtanke vid konstruerande undersöktes. Eftersom större delen av dessa 
seriekompenseringsanläggningar skickas till USA har den amerikanska standarden ASCE7-05 
använts vid beräkningar av vind-, snö- och islaster. En referensram utvecklades där inhämtad 
kunskap från förstudien och tidigare projekt på ABB presenteras. Därefter påbörjades 
lastberäkningarna, modellerandet och simuleringarna av plattformarna samt utrustningen 
ståendes på dessa plattformar. Verktygen som användes under projektet var Excel, SolidWorks 
samt SolidWorks Simulation.  
 
Resultatet av examensarbetet blev ett beräkningsprogram framtaget i Excel samt fyra modeller 
för simuleringar i SolidWorks Simulation. Två av simuleringsmodellerna är uppbyggda så att de 
kan användas på de bärbara datorer som de flesta av de anställda på ABB FACTS använder. Den 
andra uppsättningen av modeller är tänkt att användas på ABB FACTS’s beräkningsdator. 
Skillnaden mellan dessa modeller är att i de förenklade modellerna har utrustningen ståendes på 
plattformarna ersatts med punktlaster. Modellerna har verifierats mot ABB Corporate Research. 
Även en manual och en rapportmall har tagits fram. Manualen förklarar hur användaren på 
enklast möjliga sätt kombinerar Excel beräkningarna med modellerna i SolidWorks Simulation. 
Rapportmallen är utformad så att användaren snabbt och enkelt kan föra in resultaten från 
beräkningarna samt simuleringarna för att sedan kunna skicka de till kund.

Abstract 
ABB is one of the world’s leading engineering companies in power and automation technologies 
and their solutions improve performance while lowering environmental impacts for energy 
companies and industries. ABB FACTS designs equipment and plants for series and phase 
compensation. 
 
This thesis has been performed at ABB FACTS on the Mechanical Design (DM) department in 
Västerås, Sweden. The purpose of the thesis was to develop and design calculations and 
simulation tools for ABB FACTS’s standard series capacitor platforms. The thesis has also 
served as an evaluation of the FEM program SolidWorks Simulation. 
 
The thesis began with a pre study where the standards and requirements that ABB FACTS has to 
consider during design were investigated. Since most of these series compensation plants are 
sent to the United States, the American standard ASCE7-05 was used in the calculations of wind, 
snow and ice loads. A reference frame was developed where knowledge obtained from the pre 
study and previous projects in the ABB is presented. After that, the load calculations, modeling 
and simulations of the platforms and equipment standing on these platforms began. The tools 
used in this project were Excel, SolidWorks and SolidWorks Simulation. 
 
The thesis resulted in a calculation program developed in Excel and four models for simulations 
in SolidWorks Simulation. Two simulation models were modeled so that they can be used on the 
laptops that most of the employees at ABB FACTS are using. The second set of simulation 
models are designed to run on ABB FACTS’s calculation computer. These models contains in 
addition to the platform also the equipment mounted on it. The models have been verified 
against ABB Corporate Research. A manual and a report template have also been developed. 
The manual explains how the user in the simplest way combines the Excel calculations with the 
models in SolidWorks Simulation. The report template is designed so that the results from the 
calculations and simulations easily can be entered and sent to the customer.

1 INTRODUCTION 
In this chapter the background, the purpose, delimitations and the method used in this project 
are presented. 
1.1 Background 
ABB FACTS (Flexible AC Transmission System) [1] is a part of ABB Power Systems [2] which 
designs equipment and plants for series compensation. These series compensation plants, also 
know as series capacitors (SC’s) [3], are electrical installations for increasing power transmission 
capacity. Series capacitors eliminate the steady-state voltage drop along the power lines as well 
as the voltage fluctuations associated with start-ups of large electrical loads.   
 
In this thesis, calculation and CAD models of the standard platforms that ABB FACTS uses in 
their series compensation plants are modeled and simulated based on the American standard 
ASCE7-05 [4].  
1.2 Purpose 
The purpose of this thesis is to design and develop calculations and simulation tools for ABB 
FACTS’s standard series capacitor platforms in SolidWorks [5] and SolidWorks Simulation [6]. 
Different load standards and requirements will be presented and interpreted. The models will be 
built after the two types of standard platforms used in ABB FACTS. These models will be 
designed in such a way that changes in dimensions and load cases easily can be made. 
 
A manual and a report template will also be presented. The manual will explain the structure of 
the models and the procedure of making changes in them. The manual will explain how the 
inputs are obtained and which parameters are to be fed into the models, but also describe how the 
results from the simulations in a simple way can be transferred in to a report. The manual will be 
written in Swedish and in English.  
1.3 Delimitations 
Calculation and CAD tools will only be developed for the two types of standard platforms that 
ABB FACTS uses in their series capacitors. This thesis work confines to the American standard 
of ASCE7-05 in all load calculations since most of these series platforms are delivered to the 
United States. Only static loads will be considered, seismic and dynamic calculations are omitted 
entirely. No frequency analysis will be made in this project as this has previously been done at 
ABB for these platforms. 
1.4 Method 
A pre study will be performed to investigate the standards and requirements that ABB FACTS 
has to consider when a series compensation plant is designed. The American standard of 
ASCE7-05 will be used in calculations of wind, snow and ice loads. These load calculations will 
be made in Excel [7] spreadsheets so that the loads acting on the standard platforms easily can be 
obtained.  
 
 
2 
CAD models of these standard platforms will be created in SolidWorks so that any changes in 
platform types, dimensions or load cases easily can be made. The task is also to examine whether 
these CAD models are to be built by beam or shell elements. 
 
The evaluation of these standard platforms will be performed by using SolidWorks Simulation 
(former known as Cosmos Works [8]). The results from the FEM simulations will be compared 
with results from ABB Corporate Research [9] in a sharp scenario. 
 
The manual that describes the approach of these calculations and simulations will be written so 
that the user easily can follow the reasoning step by step.  
 
Finally, a report template will be developed together with the employees at ABB FACTS so that 
it easily can be modified from one project to another. It will be designed so that the results from 
the calculations and simulations in a simple way can be entered and sent to the customer. 
1.5 Benefit for ABB FACTS 
This thesis will result in following benefits for ABB FACTS: 
 
• Avoiding outsourcing all calculations and simulations at ABB Corporate Research, this 
will streamline the projects. 
 
• More reliable results, this will reduce the risk of over dimensioning. 
 
• Better and more reliable reporting data to the customers. 
 
• Evaluation of the FEM program SolidWorks Simulation. It is desirable to find out if this 
program is sufficiently strong and developed for the tasks that ABB FACTS encounters 
during their projects.

2 FRAME OF REFERENCE 
This chapter presents the theoretical reference frame and provides support and understanding 
for the remainder of the report.  
2.1 Series compensation 
The reason for series compensation is essentially to increase transmission capacity into the 
power lines by reducing the reactance in it. The maximum capacity that can be transmitted from 
node 1 to node 2 at high voltage electricity can be approximated from equation 1 and 2 below.

U  represents the voltages at either end of the nodes, whereas δ  denotes the angular 
difference of the two voltages. X  is the reactance of the transmission circuit, while P  and Q  
denote the received active and reactive power.  
 
Equation 1 suggests that the greater the reactance of a power line is the less power can be 
transferred through it. By installing series capacitors on the power line, the total reactance of the 
circuit can be reduced and maximum transmitted power can be provided. In Figure 1 below the 
difference between a power grid with and without a series capacitor is shown [10][13]. 
 
 
 
Figure 1. Power grid with and without a series capacitor [ABB Power Technologies AB, 2005].

2.2 Series capacitor  
Long distances are often the main reason for the usage of series capacitors. Series capacitors 
work like boosters as they eliminates the steady-state voltage drop along the power lines as well 
as voltage fluctuations associated with high load start-ups. 
 
A standard one phase ABB series capacitor is constructed as shown in Figure 2, 3 and 4. It has a 
capacitor bank (a), several metal oxide varistors (b), a trigger equipment (c), a damping circuit 
(d), two spark gaps (e), a fiber optic link (f), a control platform (g), a by-pass breaker (h) and 
several Rodurflex’s (i). Every component is either standing on or connected to an insulated steel 
platform. It is this platform including the insulators supporting the platform that this thesis 
focuses on. Detailed information about the equipment standing on the platform is not presented 
in this public report due to confidentiality.

2.2.1 Capacitor bank 
The capacitor bank shown in Figure 5 consist of capacitor units connected in parallel in 
sufficient number to handle the highest continuous current required of the load downstream of 
the bank. These parallel arrangements, or groups as they are called, are connected in series to 
provide the required ohmic value of compensation needed to provide the required voltage rise 
under the given operating conditions.  
 
 
Figure 5. Capacitor bank. 
 
6 
2.2.2 Metal oxide varistors 
The metal oxide varistors (MOV) shown in Figure 6 protects the capacitors against over-voltage. 
During ordinary conditions, all the power flows through the capacitor bank and when a fault 
arises the varistors limits the voltage across the capacitors. 
 
 
Figure 6. Metal oxide varistors. 
 
2.2.3 Trigger equipment 
The trigger equipment is used to force trig the spark gaps and enable the by-pass of the series 
capacitors in situations where the varistors capacity is not sufficient to absorb the excess current 
during a fault sequence. 
 
2.2.4 Damping circuit 
The damping circuit consists of two components, the reactor and the damping resistor. The 
purpose of the damping circuit shown in Figure 7 below is to limit and damp the discharge 
current caused by spark gap or closing of the switch.  
 
 
Figure 7. Damping circuit. 
 
7 
2.2.5 Spark gaps 
Spark gaps are normally used for immediate by-pass of the metal oxide varistors and the 
capacitors at internal or severe external faults or at demanding short circuit levels and duty 
cycles. 
 
2.2.6 Fiber optic link 
For communication between platform and ground, fiber optic transmission links are utilized. 
 
2.2.7 By-pass breaker 
The bypass breaker is an Auto-Puffer circuit breaker. With a closing time of half of what the 
other bypass switches have, makes it the fastest bypass switch available on the market for series 
compensation applications. This enables a great saving on metal oxide varistors in the protective 
scheme. 
 
2.2.8 Platform 
There are two types of standard platforms, one with two transverse main beams and one with 
three, this is shown in Figure 8 below. The beam arrangement for a platform is adjusted 
regarding the spatial spreading of the equipment placed on it. The dimensions of the beams are 
usually limited to two or three different types.  
 
 
 
Figure 8. The two and the three beam platform. 
 
 
The platform module includes supporting insulators, the platform (steel structure) and supporting 
structure for all equipment placed on the platform. Handrails, corona protection, ladder and other 
details related to the platform are also included. Listed below is a brief description on some of 
the sub modules. 
 
• Platform, steel structure. 
ABB uses a hot dip galvanized steel structure in the design of the platforms. The platforms 
are designed with respect to easy handling and are completely prefabricated in the workshop 
to be bolted together at the construction site. For the personal safety the platforms are 
provided with a steel grating. The stressed beams have a material strength of 355 MPa, the 
non stressed beams have normally a lower material strength. 
 
 
 
8 
• Supporting insulators 
The insulators are made of homogeneous porcelain and can handle a torque of 8 kNm due to 
the mechanical joints located between the insulators and the platforms (steel structure and 
isolator platform), see Figure 9. The solution and design is depending on environment, 
voltage level and mechanical loads from the platform.  
 
Figure 9. A supporting insulator, broken view. 
 
 
• Rodurflex  
The Rodurflex is not an ABB specific component, it is manufactured by LAPP Insulators 
[11]. The Rodurflex consists of a fiberglass core which is covered with 3 mm thick high 
temperature vulcanized silicone rubber that improves the systems mechanical characteristics 
but also protects the core during handling and installation. Since the insulators are made of 
porcelain, the Rodurflex’s are important because they absorb the tensions which the 
insulators are exposed to. A Rodurflex in a standard design can handle tensions of 210 kN 
[12]. 
 
• Corona protection. 
This sub module protects the platform and the equipment standing on it against radio 
interference voltage (RIV) and corona. There are two different aluminum profiles depending 
on voltage level. Fastening system is standardized to one standard solution.  
 
The corona protection also works as a handrail. The aluminum profile for the handrail is 
specially developed for ABB and after many years of experience it has shown that this is the 
best solution. The advantage with using the profile is the protective solution for corona 
protection and the easy erection. It has also the mechanical strength to prevent personal from 
falling of the platform. 
 
• Ladder 
The ladder gives a safe access to the platform. It is easy to handle and the turntable design 
minimize required space. The ladder can be equipped with interlocking to prevent human 
errors. There are two standard ladder solutions and one ladder design. The length of the 
ladder is adjusted depending on voltage level (length of the insulators).

• Equipment support  
There are two different standard solutions to support the varistors. Choice of support is 
depending on mechanical loads. For the reactor there is only one type of leg with variations 
on the height.

A dynamic load is a load that gives rise to the supplement forces and deformations as a result of 
accelerations in the structure and load. A load is considered static if it does not cause 
significance acceleration for the structure.  
 
Many loads should be considered as dynamic, such as rotating loads, the load of people and 
machinery shocks. In many cases the structures dynamic conditions are not treated 
computationally and therefore these calculations can be performed in the same way as for static 
loads.  
 
At pulsating or alternating loads there are risks of resonance if the frequency of the load is close 
to the structures eigenfrequency. The dynamic effects can usually be neglected if the load 
frequency is one third of the structures eigenfrequency. If the load frequency is much higher than 
the eigenfrequency of the structure, the impact of load variations can be neglected due to the 
structure which acts as a vibration damper [14].   
 
Given in this thesis is that the platforms should be considered as rigid with an eigenfrequency of 
2 Hz. These calculations have been done in previous projects and will not be included in this 
report [15]. 
 
2.3.1 Wind loads 
The wind load is inherently a dynamic load which means that its acceleration is affecting the 
structure. For structures with high stiffness and damping, that does not need to consider the 
structural vibration characteristics for the determination of wind load, the wind load can be 
treated as a static load. The wind load can sometimes be a fatigue loading. This applies mainly 
when the wind load causes a large number of oscillations of the structure.  
 
The velocity of the wind affecting the structure depends on the geographic location of the 
structure, surrounding terrain and the height of the structure. The effect of location is described 
by the reference wind speed and is mostly obtained from wind maps [14] [4]. 
 
2.3.2 Snow and ice loads 
Snow loads are in the most cases assumed to be variable and bounded loads and determined as 
the weight per horizontal area. When determining the snow loads, the form of the structure has to 
be taken into account due to wind effects and risks of sliding. The characteristic snow pressure is 
often retrieved from snow maps. 
 
Ice loads are mostly generated by changes in the temperature and freezing rain. Freezing rain 
occurs when warm moist air is forced over a layer of subfreezing air at the earth’s surface. The 
precipitation usually begins as snow that melts as it falls through the layer of warm air aloft. The 
drops then cool as they fall through the cold surface air layer and freeze on contact with the 
structure [16] [4]. 
 
 
10 
2.3.3 Dead loads 
A dead load is a static load and consists of the weight of all materials incorporated with the 
structure, including the weight of all components standing on or in the structure [4]. 
 
2.3.4 Earthquakes  
Depending on country and region, there is sometimes a risk of earthquakes. Earthquakes consist 
of dynamic forces that occur irregularly over time and to calculate these forces seismic studies 
are required. An alternative is to use sophisticated FEM programs, but ABB FACTS has not 
direct access to these programs and therefore are these kind of calculations omitted entirely in 
this thesis. 
2.4 Norms and standards 
ABB FACTS is currently using several different standards. It is essentially the costumer’s 
geographical market that determines the use of norms and standards in a project. Since most of 
these platforms are delivered to the United States, the American standard ASCE7-05 is used 
throughout this thesis. 
 
ASCE or American Society of Civil Engineers is an ANSI accredited standards development 
organization that produces consensus standards under direction of the Codes and Standards 
Activities Committee. 
 
The ASCE standard 7-05 provides minimum load requirements for the design of buildings and 
other structures that are subject to building code requirements. Wind, snow, ice, dead and live 
loads as well as appropriate load combinations are interpreted and determined in this standard 
[4].  
 
2.4.1 Wind loads 
ASCE7-05 provides three different approaches to determine the wind load from which the 
designer can choose. An expanded simplified method in which the designer can select the wind 
pressures directly without any calculation if the building meets all the requirements, one wind 
tunnel procedure and one analytical method. In this project the analytical method is used 
consistently. 
 
2.4.2 Snow loads 
The method of calculating the snow loads as ASCE7-05 offers is designed by static analysis of 
extreme values of snow amounts over a period of 50 years in the United States.  
 
2.4.3 Ice loads 
This chapter deals with various ice scenarios, such as freezing rain, in-cloud icing, wind on ice 
and hoarfrost.  
 
2.4.4 Dead loads 
The calculation of dead loads is very straight on in this standard and only a few pages are 
speared to these calculations. 
 
 
 
11 
3 METHOD 
This chapter describes the approach of load calculations, CAD modeling and FEM simulations.  
3.1 Load combinations 
Structures, components, and foundations shall, according to ASCE7-05, be designed so that their 
design strength equals or exceeds the effects of the factored loads in equation 3.

The coefficient D stands for the dead loads, S for snow loads, R for rain loads and W for the 
static wind loads. 
 
ABB Corporate Research uses two design load combinations when designing series capacitor 
platforms. Equation 4 is for the transverse Y-direction and equation 5 for the longitudinal X-
direction of the platform.

T in equation 4 and 5 represents the terminal forces, Y stands for forces in the transverse 
direction of the platform and X is forces in the longitudinal direction. 
 
3.2 Load and terrain categories 
When calculating on wind, snow and ice loads the ambient roughness has to be considered. 
Below follows a categorization of terrain roughness from ASCE7-05.  
 
Exposure B shall apply where the ground surface roughness condition, as defined by Surface 
Roughness B, prevails in the upwind direction for a distance of at least 792 m or 20 times the 
height of the building, whichever is greater. 
 
Surface Roughness B: Urban and suburban areas, wooded areas, or other terrain with numerous 
closely spaced obstructions having the size of single-family dwellings or larger. 
 
Exposure C shall apply for all cases where Exposures B or D does not apply. 
 
Surface Roughness C: Open terrain with scattered obstructions having heights generally less than 
9 m. This category includes flat open country, grasslands and all water surfaces in hurricane 
prone regions. 
 
Exposure D shall apply where the ground surface roughness, as defined by Surface Roughness 
D, prevails in the upwind direction for a distance greater than 1524 m. 
 
Surface Roughness D: Flat, unobstructed areas and water surfaces outside hurricane prone 
regions. This category includes smooth mud flats, salt flats and unbroken ice.

The wind directional factor

The speed of wind V  varies greatly depending on the country and region. Therefore, this 
constant is determined from a wind map. In Appendix A, a wind map of the United States is 
presented. 
 
The importance factor I  used in equation 7 diversifies from 0.77 to 1.15 depending on if the 
region in which the plant or building is standing has a higher risk of hurricanes. This is shown in 
 
14 
Table 4 below. Only category IV  (four), which includes communication towers, fuel storage 
tanks, cooling towers and electrical substation structures, is treated in this thesis. 
 
Table 4. The importance factor of the wind loads [ASCE, 2006]. 
 
 
 
Depending on whether the structure is considered as rigid (natural frequency, 
1
f
Hz
≥
 ) or 
flexible (natural frequency, 
1
f
Hz
<
) the gust effect factor G  is determined in different ways. 
For a flexible structure the gust effect factor is calculated according to equation 10 and for a rigid 
structure according to equation 11.

3.4 Snow loads 
Depending on the roof type, the snow loads are calculated in different ways. Below follows the 
calculations used depending on difference in roof type. 
 
3.4.1 Flat roofs 
For a flat roof the snow loads are determined by equation 25. A roof classifies as flat if its slope 
is less than 5 degrees.

Table 7. The thermal factor [ASCE, 2006]. 
 
 
I , the importance factor is found in Table 8. As mentioned in chapter 3.3 Wind loads this thesis 
will only treat buildings classified as category IV  (four), which includes electrical substations 
and plants, so this factor is set to 1.2 through all snow load calculations.   
 
Table 8. The importance factor depending on building category [ASCE, 2006]. 
 
 
The ground snow loads  
g
p  used in equation 25 is obtained from a snow map. Appendix B 
shows a snow map for the United States. Snow loads are set to zero in Hawaii, and for colder 
locations in Alaska Table 9 is used.

3.4.2 Sloped roofs 
Snow loads acting on sloped roof is assumed to act on a horizontal projection of that surface. 
The sloped roof loads are obtained by multiplying the flat roof snow loads by the slope roof 
factor

t
C  value of 1.1 
the slope factor is determined by Figure 10b and for those with a 
t
C  value of 1.2 the Figure 10c 
is used.

3.5 Dead loads 
After careful consideration together with higher courts at ABB FACTS, the dead load will in 
addition to the platform with supporting insulators only consist of the capacitor bank, the 
damping circuit and the metal oxide varistors. These components weigh, compared to the other 
equipment on the platform, considerably more. It is also these components that have the largest 
effective load surface.  Depending on the platform type and size, the total dead load varies from 
40000 to 60000 kg. 
 
When calculating on the weight of the platform, 105 
2
/
kg m  can be used as a reference figure. 
This gives, in a standard version, a two beam platform a total weight of approximately 9000 kg 
and a three beam platform a total weight of about 12000 kg. 
 
The weight of a supporting insulator depends on the length of it, which in turn depends on the 
plants voltage level. Somewhere between 700 and 1000 kg can be expected that an insulator in 
its standard version weighs. 
 
The capacitor bank has a weigh of about 9000 kg per stack. The number of stacks varies 
depending on the plant size and location, but in a typical case the capacitor bank have two stacks 
and weighs 25000 kg on a two beam platform. On a three beam platform the capacitor bank have 
four stacks, this result in a weight of 50000 kg. 
 
The weight of a damping circuit varies slightly depending on the plant size, but on average, this 
module weighs about 2000 kg. 
 
The metal oxide varistors have a weight of approximately 4500 kg, plus minus a couple of 
hundred kilos depending on the number of varistors units and terminals.    
3.6 Pre-stress loads 
Pre-stressing forces in the diagonally mounted Rodurflex’s, see Figure 11, are in this report 
named as pre-stress loads. These loads are for the most of ABB’s plants set to 20 kN.

3.7 Modeling 
No deeper breakdown of the model creating will be presented in this chapter, the reader is 
assumed to possess basic knowledge in this area. Dimensions and other sensitive information 
will not be presented in this general report due to confidentiality. The models are modeled so that 
the dimensions and structure quickly and easily can be modified. All models are constructed of 
3D sketches. In addition to regular models, simplifications are developed to facilitate and speed 
up the simulations. 
 
3.7.1 Platform 
The base of the platform consists of either two or three HEA beams, depending on platform type. 
Across these beams are four capacitor beams, four apparatus support beams and several grating 
support beams placed, all beams of the type HEA. The cross beams, marked blue in Figure 12, 
stiffens the platform. These cross beams together with the outer frame are modeled from an L-
profile. The command “Structural Remember” is used for all beams in the platform, this feature 
keeps the model size down. 
 
 
Figure 12. CAD model of a three beam platform with blue marked cross beams. 
 
3.7.2 Supporting insulators 
The supporting insulators are modeled in three subassemblies; the porcelain insulator, the 
insulator platform and the upper end joint.  
 
The porcelain insulator is modeled as a single solid piece. With the command “Revolve” in 
SolidWorks a 3D profile is created from a 2D sketch. The material in this 3D profile is set to 
homogenous porcelain.  
 
The insulator platform consists of several parts, see Figure 13 on the next page. On top of the 
bottom plate, which is the base of the model and created by an “Extrude”, stands a square tube 
built by the command “Structural Member”. Four support plates are connecting the bottom plate 
with the square tube. Above the square tube are two square plates located with a mechanical joint 
between them. These three elements, along with the supporting plates, are modeled with the 
command “Extrude”.  
 
 
 
23 
 
Figure 13. CAD model of the supporting insulator platform. 
 
The upper end joint consists of a circular and a square plate, between these is the mechanical 
joint located. The material in the insulator platform and the upper end joint is set to galvanized 
steel. 
 
3.7.3 Capacitor bank 
The capacitate stack, shown in Figure 14 below, consists only of a capacitor unit, a capacitor 
frame and an insulator. These components are then multiplied by using linear and circular 
patterns, this in order to reduce the model size. The capacitor frame is modeled as a solid block 
with “Extruded Cuts” in several directions. The capacitor unit is an extruded body with a circular 
connection. A revolved 2D sketch forms the insulators.  
 
 
 
Figure 14. CAD model of a capacitor stack. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
24 
3.7.4 Damping circuit 
The damping resistor is mainly designed with the “Revolve” and the “Extrude” command. The 
connections are modeled with the “Sweep” command. 
 
The reactor and the insulators which the reactor is standing on are modeled using “Revolve”. 
The mounts between the reactor and the insulators are made from two L-profiles by using 
“Structural Member”. The other components in this assembly are made from by “Extrude”. Both 
the reactor and the damping resistor are shown in Figure 15 below. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 15. CAD model of the damping circuit. 
 
3.7.5 Metal oxide varistors 
The tripod to the metal oxide varistors is modeled from six UPE beams and four ABB specific 
beams, using the “Structural Remember” feature. The varistors are designed with the “Revolve” 
and “Linear Pattern” command. The result is shown in Figure 16. 
 
 
 
Figure 16. CAD model of the metal oxide varistors. 
 
 
 
25 
3.8 Simulation 
As mentioned in chapter 3.7 Modeling, there are in addition to regular models also 
simplifications, this results in four simulation models; two for three beam platform and two for 
two beam platform. One of the models in each platform type is designed to run on laptops and 
does not containing the equipment standing on the platform. The equipment and the forces acting 
on them are replaced by point forces. The second set of simulation models are designed to run on 
ABB’s calculation computer. These models contains in addition to the platform also the 
equipment mounted on it. The results between the regular and the simplified models do not 
differ. The main reason for using the complete regular models is to give the costumer a more 
accurate visual perceptive. 
 
3.8.1 Beam or shell elements 
The task to examine whether the models are to be built up of beam or shell elements was 
developed at a time when ABB still was using Cosmos, today known as SolidWorks Simulation. 
Cosmos gave the user the ability to choose a way of meshing the model at the beginning of each 
study. In SolidWorks Simulation, this feature has been removed and replaced with an automatic 
“Mixed Mesh”. By default, any surface bodies will be treated as shell elements, any structural 
members will be treated as beam elements, and everything else will be treated as solid elements.  
 
The platforms, excluding the outer frames, are in these simulations meshed as beams as this 
speeds up the simulations. The outer frames are meshed as solid since wind loads are affecting 
on these surfaces and SolidWorks Simulation does not support pressure on beam elements. The 
support insulators are meshes as solid.  
 
3.8.2 Connections and fixtures 
When using both beam and solid elements in a simulation, bonded contact sets between these 
elements are needed. Bonded entities behave as if they were welded or bolted.  
 
Rigid connectors are placed between the insulator platform and the square tube standing on it. 
These rigid connectors rigidly connect faces from one solid body to faces from another solid 
body. In this case rigid connectors simulate the welds, which have been removed to allow the 
simulations.  
 
To simulate the foundation bolts, fixed support is used in the holes on the insulator platform, see 
Figure 17.  
 
 
 
Figure 17. Fixed support on the insulator platform.

The mechanical joints in the supporting insulators, illustrated in Figure 18, have a structure that 
resembles a universal joint. These joints have in the simulation models been replaced by simple 
square blocks. To make the models as close as to reality, these blocks are in the ends connected 
with “Hinge” connections. The “Hinge” connections are locked so that they only allow 
movement in two directions and entirely limit rotations along the insulators. 
 
 
 
Figure 18. The mechanical joint in the supporting insulators. 
 
3.8.3 Loads 
The equivalent force magnitude acting on the platform generated by pressure is equal to the 
pressure times the area, this is shown in Figure 19 for an insulator on the next page. The size of 
the wind pressure depends on the height of the platform since the pressure increases with 
increasing distance from the ground. It is important to apply the right pressure on the right area 
and height. 
 
In the same way as for wind loads, force equals pressure times area, the snow and ice loads are 
applied on the platform and equipment. The advantage with calculating forces in this way is that 
the user only needs to calculate the pressure acting on the surface. In the regular models, 
SolidWorks determines the surface areas and hence the forces acting on the platform and 
equipment. In the simplified models the user has to determine the effective load surface, 
preferably from a dimensioned drawing and manually calculate the magnitude of the force.  
 
In addition to the external forces there are weights of the equipment, dead loads, affecting on the 
platform. These forces are in the simplified models set as point masses with the direction to the 
ground. In the regular models, SolidWorks generates these loads if the right material properties 
are given for all components.

The diagonal mounted Rodurflex’s and the pre-stress loads located in them are simulated with 
tension springs. These springs have an axial stiffness of 
6
2.5 10
⋅
 N/m and a tension preload force 
of 20 kN. The springs are attached to the support plates down on the insulator platform and the 
other end is attached at the upper end joint on the support insulator standing next, this is 
illustrated in Figure 20 below.

3.4.4 Mesh 
In these models, SolidWorks Simulation only generates a working mesh when all settings are set 
to the highest and finest (this is a documented error that often occurs for large assemblies), this 
gives that no convergence study can be done for the results generated by SolidWorks Simulation. 
The elements in the models have a global size of 50 mm and a tolerance of 3 mm. The few 
available mesh settings are shown in Figure 21.

4 RESULTS  
This chapter presents and summarizes the results from this thesis. 
4.1 The calculation tool 
The calculations are made as previously mentioned in Excel with a work sheet for each load 
calculation, see Figure 23. The user only needs to have the dimensions of the plant and the 
geographic location in mind, the calculation tool generate the right wind, snow and ice pressure 
as a function of height. The XML code for the Excel program is available at Appendix E.

4.2 The simulation tool 
This part resulted in four models designed in SolidWorks, two regular models and two simplified 
models. Two of these, the simplified and the regular three beam model are shown in Figure 24. 
The main reason for why there exist regular models is the visual requirements from the 
costumers. These customers want to ensure that the equipment standing on the platform is 
included in the calculations. The results between the simplified and regular models do not differ.

4.1 The user manual 
The user manual describes how to use the Excel calculation program and the simulation models 
in SolidWorks Simulation, and how to combine the calculations and simulations in the easiest 
way. The manual is given in Appendix G. 
4.1 The report template 
The report template, which is given in Appendix E is designed so that the results from the 
calculations and simulations quickly and easily can be entered and sent to the customer.

5 VERIFICATION 
This chapter presents the way of verification made in this thesis. 
 
The simulation models developed in this thesis is verified against the results produced by ABB 
Corporate Research. ABB Corporate Research uses a self-developed FEM program called 
Ramses [17]. Based on values from sharp scenarios, displacements in the platforms, see Figure 
25 and 26, and forces in the foundation, shown in Figure 27 and 28, are calculated and 
compared.  
 
 
 
No specific values from the simulations will be presented in this public report due to 
confidentiality.

The displacement results from the two independent models differ from 5 % to 11 % under 
extreme circumstances.

Figure 28. The foundation forces generated by Ramses [S.Berggren, 2009]. 
 
 
The difference between the foundations loads calculated with SolidWorks Simulation varies at 
maximum 7 % from the values calculated with Ramses. With these reasonable differences in the 
results, the models can be considered as correct.

6 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
This chapter summarizes this thesis and the results presented in previous chapters are discussed. 
 
Initially only wind loads was meant to be considered in the calculations and simulations but after 
discussions with the supervisor at ABB FACTS, snow and ice loads was committed. However, 
there is no material to verify simulations with snow and ice loads at the moment.  
 
Although the results from the calculations and simulations are in line with the results from ABB 
Corporate Research, critical thinking should be used by the user when analyzing the results. In 
the reference material from ABB Corporate Research, the height from the ground to the center of 
the equipment is not taken in account when the pressure is calculated and applied on the model. 
Also, a surcharge of 15 % is applied on as extra margin by ABB Corporate Research in 
assessment of the wind loads. These differences between the inputs in the models presented in 
this report and the models used by ABB Corporate Research contributes most likely to 
differences in the final results, although the differences are very small and the results can be 
considered as very good. 
 
There are a number of uncertainties identified during the project, however due to lack of time 
and for practical reasons these uncertainties could not be investigated sufficiently. Below follows 
a short brief of the identified uncertainties: 
 
• The load cases applied to the models are theoretical. Local variations in wind, snow and 
ice loads can of course occur.  
 
• Uncertainty in the insulator platform. It is uncertain how the program handles the 
connection (Rigid Connector) between the bottom plate and the square tube and if the 
force is transmitted as in a real weld. 
 
• Inadequate Mesh, the mesh properties in SolidWorks Simulation are insufficient and only 
a small amount of changes can be made by the user. 
 
• Since “Remote Load” can not be applied on beam elements, there is an uncertainty in 
how much torque that is lost when the loads is placed directly on the equipment support. 
However, this only concerns the simplified models. 
 
• A major uncertainty is how easy the platforms fall into self oscillation. This phenomenon 
is probably more noticeable the higher the platforms are. 
 
The Excel calculations with the SolidWorks models can profitable be used in calculations and 
simulations of wind loads on series capacitor platforms, but the user should check the reliability 
of the results before they are submitted to the customer. 
 
This thesis has also served as a test of the FEM program SolidWorks Simulation. It was desirable 
to find out if this program is sufficiently strong and developed for the tasks that ABB FACTS 
encounter during their projects. During this thesis, it was found that SolidWorks Simulation has 
developed a lot since the previous version, but unfortunately not enough. Meshes containing both 
solid and beam elements (Mix Mesh) does not work satisfactorily and the support of beam 
elements is still very poor, for example does not remote load always work as planed on beam 
elements. Although this is a supplementary module to the SolidWorks and it is very cleverly 
 
35 
integrated into the modeling program, ABB FACTS should investigate and try other FEM 
simulation programs available on the market.

7 RECOMMENDATIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
In this chapter recommendations and future work are presented.  
 
It is recommended that the ABB FACTS changes to a more reliable and recognized FEM 
simulation program. During this thesis, SolidWorks Simulation has proven to be a fully 
functional program, but that it is not suitable for large and more advanced simulations. The 
program lacks the ability to limit the mesh area (the entire model must be meshed), the poor 
handling of beam elements and the bug that prevents the “Remote Load” sometimes to be 
applied on beam elements are some of the reasons which makes that SolidWorks Simulation 
does not feel stable and fully developed. It is possible that these errors have been corrected in 
some new service pack, but it nonetheless strongly recommended that ABB tries other FEM 
simulation programs available on the market. 
 
There is a lot of more work that can be done to improve and develop these models, especially the 
simulation models. Below follows suggestions of future work. 
 
Linking values from Excel to load magnitudes in SolidWorks Simulation and results from 
SolidWorks Simulation back to Excel are future work which with the time and knowledge 
available should be resolved quickly. A version of the Excel program which focuses on the IEEE 
standard would also likely to be done in the future. 
 
Since there at the moment are not material to verify the ice and snow simulations and load 
simulations on the two beam platform is it essential that these verifications are done as soon as 
possible. 
 
Even if it is given in this thesis that these platforms have an eigenfrequency of 2 Hz, is it of 
interest to verify and check when the platform ports in self-oscillation by doing a frequency 
analysis.  
 
In the simulation models there are several changes that could have been done if the calculation 
computer had come at an earlier stage of this thesis. The regular models are currently very 
unstable, only about every fifth simulation generates a result. Instability in the models is the 
main reason for these failures.   
 
Instead of using “Fixed Support” on the insulator platforms, “Ground Bolt Support” could be 
used. This is something that was meant to be used during the thesis since it would facilitate the 
foundation force calculations, but after several failed simulations this option was disregarded and 
replaced with “Fixed Support”.  
 
The “Spring Connections” representing the Rodurflex’s could be replaced with solid models so 
that the user can verify that Rodurflex’s handles the tensions as intended.  
 
In the future it would be of interest to add the other components standing on the platform to the 
simulation models. This would provide an even more real scenario, but to verify these upcoming 
models ABB Corporate Research would have to modify their Ramses models as they only 
contain the platform with capacitor bank, reactor and metal oxide varistors.

Abstract 
This manual is created as a part of a thesis made at ABB FACTS and the department DM. The 
purpose of the thesis is to develop and design calculations and simulations models for ABB 
FACTS’s standard series capacitor platforms in SolidWorks and SolidWorks Simulation. The 
American standard of ASCE7-05 is used in calculations of wind, snow and ice loads since most 
of these series platforms are delivered to the United States.  
 
The load calculations are made in several Excel work sheets and the simulations are performed 
in SolidWorks Simulation (former know as Cosmos). This manual explains how to use the Excel 
calculation program, simulation models in SolidWorks Simulation and how to combine the 
calculations and simulations in the easiest way.

1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 ASCE standard 7-05 
 
ASCE or American Society of Civil Engineers is an ANSI accredited standards development 
organization that produces consensus standards under direction of the Codes and Standards 
Activities Committee. 
 
The ASCE standard 7-05 provides minimum load requirements for the design of buildings and 
other structures that are subject to building code requirements. Wind, snow, ice, dead and live 
loads as well as appropriate load combinations are interpreted and determined in this standard.  
 
1.1.1 Wind loads 
ASCE7-05 provides three different approaches of determine the wind load from which the 
designer can choose. An expanded simplified method in which the designer can select the wind 
pressures directly without any calculation if the building meets all the requirements, one wind 
tunnel procedure and one analytical method. In this manual the analytical method is used 
consistently. 
 
1.1.2 Snow loads 
The method of calculating the snow loads as ASCE7-05 offers is designed by static analysis of 
extreme values of snow amounts over a period of 50 years in the United States. 
 
1.1.3 Ice loads 
This chapter deals with various ice scenarios, such as freezing rain, in-cloud icing, wind on ice 
and hoarfrost. 
 
1.1.4 Dead loads 
The calculation of dead loads is very straight on in this standard and only a few pages are 
speared to these calculations. 
1.2 SolidWorks Simulation 
SolidWorks Simulation, former known as Cosmos, is an expansion to SolidWorks and is used to 
perform finite element analysis. Further than the simplified version “Xpress” which is included 
in all SolidWorks licenses, there is a heavier “Professional” version and it is this which is used 
through all simulations in this manual.

2 CALCULATIONS AND SIMULATIONS 
2.1 Excel calculation 
Before the calculations can be initiated, the user needs to know where the series compensator 
will be located geographically and the dimensions off it. 
 
2.1.1 Wind loads 
The inputs for the wind load calculations, shown in Figure 1 below, are marked as yellow cells. 
The white cells are results and can not be modified. 
 
 
 
Figure 1. The input data for the wind load calculations.

The wind speed is obtained from the wind map included as a separate work sheet named “Wind 
map”.  
 
The occupancy category can be changed, but for calculations on series capacitors category four 
is used. (Category four includes communication towers, fuel storage tanks, cooling towers and 
electrical substation structures). 
 
The exposure category is defined as follows: 
 
• Category B: Urban and suburban areas, wooded areas, or other terrain with numerous 
closely spaced obstructions having the size of single-family dwellings or larger. 
 
• Category C: Open terrain with scattered obstructions having heights generally less than 9 
m. This category includes flat open country, grasslands and all water surfaces in 
hurricane prone regions. 
 
• Category D: Flat, unobstructed areas and water surfaces outside hurricane prone regions. 
This category includes smooth mud flats, salt flats and unbroken ice. 
   
The topography factor is calculated as

K
K
=
+
+
+
, but the most critical approach is when 
zt
K  reaches the value 1 and 
therefore this factor should be set as 1 through all calculations. 
 
The height, width and length of the structure are information that the user must know before 
calculations can begin. 
 
The damping ratio varies from 0.01 to 0.07, but according to IEEE693-2005, A.1.3.2 “Static 
coefficient method” this factor should be set as 0.02 for these platforms. 
 
The structure period coefficient has suggested range of values from 0.020 to 0.035 
It is only used in the calculation when a structure is considered “flexible”.  A structure is 
considered “flexible” when it has a natural frequency, 
1
f < Hz. Otherwise the structure is 
considered “rigid”. 
 
The wind directionality factor is set to 0.85 through all calculations. 
 
The force coefficient is calculated differently depending on how the surface where the wind 
affects appears. 
 
After the correct input data is entered, Excel generates the output data, see Figure 2, which is to 
be fed into the simulation models. The output of the wind load calculations is a correct wind 
pressure as a function of the height and the force coefficient.

2.1.2 Snow loads 
The in- and outputs for the snow load calculations are shown in Figure 3. 
 
 
Figure 3. The in and output data for the snow load calculations.

The occupancy category can be changed but as in the wind calculations, category four is used 
for calculations on series capacitors.   
 
The ground snow load is obtained from a snow map included as a work sheet named “Snow 
map”. 
 
The length of the high and low roof, the distance from eave to ridge, roof type and 
obstructions height are information that the user need to have before calculations can begin. 
 
The exposure factor is defined as follows: 
 
Terrain Category                                          Fully Exposed     Partially Exposed     Sheltered

                                                0.9                     1.0                       1.1 
D  
 
 
                                                0.8                     0.9                       1.0 
 
 
• Partially Exposed: All roofs except as indicated below. 
• Fully Exposed: Roofs exposed on all sides with no shelter afforded by terrain, higher 
structures or trees. Roofs that contain several large pieces of mechanical equipment, 
parapets which extend above height of balanced snow load, or other obstructions are not 
in this category. 
• Sheltered: Roofs located tight in among conifers that qualify as obstruction. 
 
The thermal factor is determined as bellow:    
                                                                                                           
 
 
Ct       
All structures except as indicated below:                                                                            1.0     
 
Structures kept just above freezing and others with cold, ventilated roofs in                     1.1

2.1.3 Ice loads 
The user needs to know member size and type from which the platform is built from. 
 
The occupancy category can be changed, but for calculations on series capacitors category four 
is used.  
 
The nominal ice thickness is obtained from an ice map, this ice map is included as a work sheet 
named “Ice map”. 
 
The topography factor is, as mentioned in “2.1.1 Wind loads”, calculated as

, but the most critical approach is when

K  reaches the value 1 and 
therefore this factor should be set as 1 through all calculations. 
 
The user needs to know the height above ground for the platform before calculations can begin. 
 
The output, a uniformed distributed ice load, is shown in Figure 4 below.

2.3 Simulations  
There are in addition to the regular models also simplifications, this results in four simulation 
models; two for three beam platform and two for two beam platform. One of the models in each 
platform type is designed to run on laptops and does not containing the equipment standing on 
the platform. The equipment and the forces acting on them are replaced by point forces. The 
second set of simulation models are designed to run on ABB’s calculation computer. These 
models contains in addition to the platform also the equipment mounted on it. The results 
between the regular and the simplified models do not differ. The main reason for using the 
complete regular models is to give the costumer a more accurate visual perceptive. 
 
2.2.1 Starting a simulation 
In order to get SolidWorks Simulation, the user needs to select it from “Tools” and then “Add-
Ins”. In “Add-Ins”, check both checkboxes for SolidWorks Simulation as shown in Figure 5 
below. 
 
 
Figure 5. Set up of SolidWorks Simulation. 
 
To start a simulation of the platform, open desired model and select the “Study SC_Y” tab, see 
Figure 6. 
 
 
Figure 6. The Study tab.

As shown in Figure 6, there are two study tabs, on for simulations in the transverse Y-direction 
and one for the longitudinal X-direction of the platform. 
 
Now it should look like in Figure 7. Figure 7a is for the simplified model and 7b for the regular 
model. To edit a feature in the Study tree, right click on desired feature and select “Edit 
Definition”.

2.2.2 Connections and fixtures 
When using both “Beam” and “Solid” elements in a simulation, bonded contact sets between 
these elements are needed, see Figure 8. Bonded entities behave as if they were welded or bolted.

Rigid connectors, shown in Figure 9, are placed between the insulator platform and the square 
tube standing on it. These rigid connectors rigidly connect faces from one solid body to faces 
from another solid body. In this case rigid connectors simulate the welds. 
 
 
Figure 9. Rigid connectors between the base plate and the square tube. 
 
To simulate the foundation bolts, fixed support is used in the holes on the insulator platform, see 
Figure 10.  
 
 
Figure 10. Fixed support on the insulator platform.

The mechanical joints in the insulators, shown in Figure 11, have a structure that resembles 
universal joints. These joints have in the simulation models been replaced by simple square 
blocks. To make the models as close as to reality, these blocks have in the ends been connected 
with “Hinge” connections. The “Hinge” connections have been locked so that they only allow 
movement in two directions and entirely limit rotations along the insulators. 
 
 
 
Figure 11. The mechanical joint in the insulators. 
 
The diagonal mounted Rodurflex’s and the pre-stress loads located in them are simulated with 
tension springs, see Figure 12. These springs have been given an axial stiffness of 
6
2.5 10
⋅
 N/m 
and a tension preload force of 20 kN. The springs are attached to the support plates down on the 
insulator platform and the other end is attached at the upper end joint on the support insulator 
standing next.

These settings are already made for all models, the user do not need to bury into these.

2.2.3 Loads 
The equivalent force magnitude acting on the platform generated by pressure is equal to the 
pressure times the area. It is important to apply the right pressure on the right area and height. 
 
All loads are placed on the right place and right component, the user only needs to calculate the 
magnitude, and this is where the Excel calculation program is used.  
 
To modify a the wind pressure on a component in the regular model, right click on the intended 
pressure and select “Edit Definition”, this is also shown in Figure 13 below. 
 
 
Figure 13. Editing the pressure. 
 
In “Edit Definition” the user have to control that the magnitude of the pressure is the same as 
calculated with the Excel program, if not, then change to the right value with respect to the 
height (the distance from ground to the center of the component). This is shown in Figure 14. 
 
 
Figure 14. The right pressure from the Excel calculations is feed in to the simulation model. 
 
The user should also check that the pressure is applied on the right surfaces. In Figure 15 on the 
next side, wind pressure on the capacitor bank is illustrated. 
 
 
12 
 
Figure 15. Wind pressure on the capacitor bank in a regular three beam model. 
 
To modify the wind load on a component in the simplified model, right click on the intended 
force and select “Edit Definition” (See Figure 16). 
 
 
Figure 16. Editing the load. 
 
 
13 
Since no components and therefore no faces are available in these models, the user must 
calculate the wind loads as the pressure times the area and enter in the “Edit Definition”. The 
pressure is obtained, as for the regular models, from the Excel program. The user needs to 
calculate the surface area where the wind is acting, preferably from a detail drawing. From the 
detail drawing, the user should also obtain the mass of the component and enter in the same 
“Edit Definition” mentioned above, this is shown in Figure 17. 
 
 
Figure 17. Remote wind pressure and mass on the capacitor bank. 
 
 
Even in these models the user should ensure that the force acts in the right place. In Figure 18, 
the wind force acting on the capacitor bank in a simplified three beam model is shown. 
 
 
14 
 
Figure 18. Remote wind load acting on the capacitor bank in a simplified three beam model. 
 
 
 
The same procedure as described above for the capacitor bank is used to simulate the wind loads 
for the MOV, the reactor and the insulator. Figure 19 below shows a platform with wind pressure 
on the insulators. 
 
 
Figure 19. Wind pressure on the insulators. 
 
The gravity is in all models set to 9.81 
2
/
m s , the user do not need to modify it.

2.2.4 Mesh and run 
When all loads are properly fed into the model the mesh process can begin. To generate a mesh 
to the model, right click on the Mesh feature in the Study tree and select “Create Mesh”, see 
Figure 20. In the mesh option the user needs to make sure that the mesh density is set to “Fine”, 
this to generate a fine mesh and reliable results (this is also the only setting that will generate a 
fully working mesh in this program). 
 
 
Figure 20. The “Create Mesh” option. 
 
 
After the mesh is generated the user is able to start the simulation by selecting “Run” in the 
Simulation bar, this is illustrated in Figure 21.

2.2.5 Results 
The simulation time may vary from 15 minutes to several hours depending on the model size and 
the inputs. After a successful simulation, SolidWorks Simulation will generate three standard 
results in form of stress, displacement and strain. Figure 22 shows the displacement on a three 
beam platform. 
 
Figure 22. Displacement in a three beam platform.

To obtain the foundation forces select “Result Tools” and then “Reaction Forces” from the 
Simulation toolbar (see Figure 23). 
 
 
Figure 23. The “Reaction Forces” option in the Simulation toolbar. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
18 
In the “Reaction Force” option, select all bottom faces of the insulator platforms, see Figure 24, 
and select “Update”. SolidWorks Simulation calculates and shows the reaction forces and 
torques of these faces, the user can now collect the information (displacements in Y- and X-
direction and the reaction forces) and feed it into the report template.
