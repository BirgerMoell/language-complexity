Sammanfattning 
Denna rapport inkluderar en litteraturstudie inom området ”Diesel Dual Fuel”-motorer 
(hädanefter kallat DDF-motorer). Rapporterna som redovisas i litteraturstudien behandlar DDF-
motorer med CNG (naturgas) som huvudbränsle och diesel som tändkälla. Utöver 
litteraturstudien så byggdes en CNG bränsleanläggning. Bränsleanläggningen och provcellen där 
testerna utfördes är beskrivna i rapporten tillsammans med resultat från körningarna. Redovisade 
resultat visar emissioner, värmefrigörelse och cylindertryckskurvor vid körning med DDF. 
 
Litteraturstudien visade att den mesta forskningen gjorts med tunga dieselmotorer. 
Forskningsrapporterna som redovisas beskriver de huvudsakliga intresseområdena inom DDF-
teknologin. Dessa inkluderar; insprutningsstrategier, diesel/naturgas-förhållande, 
låglastegenskaper, knack, emissionsnivåer och dieselinsprutarens utförandes påverkan på 
förbränningen. DDF-motorer lider generellt av dåliga låglastegenskaper och begränsningar vid 
högre laster p.g.a. knack och problem med emissionsnivåer. En stor utmaning är att kunna 
hantera de ökade utsläppen av kolväten, speciellt vid låga laster kombinerat med låga 
avgastemperaturer. 
 
Det huvudsakliga arbetet har varit att slutföra och validera installationen av bränsleanläggningen. 
Utöver installationen och valideringen utav den så utfördes ett insprutningsvinkelsvep med 
dieselinsprutningen och ett försök att öka lasten med ökad mängd CNG. Resultat från 
insprutningsvinkelsvepet visade att valet av insprutningsvinkel och insprutningsstrategi kan 
förbättras. Vid en låglastpunkt som utvärderades gav insprutningsvinkelns förändring från 5 
oFÖD till 55 oFÖD en minskning av NOx med mer än 90 % och samtidigt en momentökning. 
Detta är endast ett exempel på hur valet av insprutningsvinkel påverkar ett emissionsämne. Det 
anses dock troligt att en flerinsprutningsstrategi skulle kunna minska råemissionerna och 
samtidigt minska specifika bränsleförbrukningen vid låga laster. 
 
För fortsatt arbete så presenteras rekommendationer och teorier gällande DDF-motorer och 
CNG-bränsleanläggningen i slutet av rapporten.

Abstract 
The work covered in this report includes a literature study of the diesel dual fuel technology 
(hereinafter referred to as DDF). The literature study covers earlier work that has been done 
regarding the use of compressed natural gas (CNG) and diesel in a DDF system. Moreover a one 
cylinder research diesel engine was fitted with a CNG fuel system for experimental testing. The 
installation of the engine and the test cell is described. Results from the tests are presented 
covering emissions, heat release and pressure traces from the DDF-concept. 
 
During the literature study it was found that most research was related to heavy duty diesel 
engines. The research papers covered in this report describes the main areas of interests in DDF 
engines including injection strategies, amount of diesel fuel ratio, low load performance, 
knocking, emission levels and the effect of the injector geometry. When looking at the concept 
of DDF engines, the main problems are poor low load characteristics and proneness to knock at 
high loads and emission levels. A major concern is the ability to handle the high levels of 
hydrocarbon emissions especially at low loads associated with low exhaust gas temperatures. 
 
The main focus of the work presented in this report has been on completing the installation of a 
CNG system and making it work. Although, experimental testing was performed and an injection 
sweep and an attempt to increase load was tested. Results from the injection sweep showed that 
the choice of SOI (start of injection) and the injection strategy could most likely be improved at 
low loads. Looking at a single injection strategy moving from SOI at 5 oBTDC to 55 oBTDC 
lowered the nitrous oxide emissions by more than 90 % and at the same time increasing net 
torque. However, this is just an example of what influence the SOI has on one emission. It is 
believed that a multi-injection strategy could reduce the engine out emissions and at the same 
time improving combustion efficiency at low loads. 
 
For further work recommendations and theories of the author are presented at the end of the 
report.

1 INTRODUCTION 
Both the otto and the diesel engine has gone through a large number 
development steps since it’s first market stand in the late 19th century. These 
development steps have all in one way or another focused on increasing the 
overall efficiency of the engine. It was as late as 1989 when the 3-way catalyst 
became a legislative directive for passenger cars in Sweden. Since that year, 
the emission legislatives have been significantly toughened. The continuously 
hardened legislative laws are leading towards less emitting engines and thus 
leading to that a tremendous amount of development needs to be done. Figure 
1.1 illustrates the emission legislative progress during the last years for heavy 
duty engines in Europe. The picture shows the limits for the ESC (European 
Stationary Cycle).

As seen, the boundaries are being more and more tightened. At this stage, 
keeping in mind the increased awareness of the effects of global warming, there 
are no indications of that the emission legislatives will be loosened. However, 
depending on each country’s technological progress, not all countries in the 
world have the same legislative limits. For instance, the sulphur content in 
diesel in countries such as Iran and India differs from the low sulphur mk1 
diesel used in Sweden. One can therefore not only improve engine emission 
levels by engine hardware development but also through the usage of different 
fuels. One alternative for the two countries mentioned could be to replace the 
usage of diesel with CNG (compressed natural gas). This could be done by 
converting diesel engines to run on CNG and diesel, a so called diesel dual fuel 
engine (DDF-engine). Besides, both these countries have the plenty of CNG for 
such a realization. To better understand the limitations and possibilities with a 
 
 
4
DDF-engine one needs to look at the basic fundamentals of the two different 
combustion principles that is used. 
 
Diesel engines or CI (compression ignition) engines utilizes high compression 
ratios compared to those of the SI (spark ignition) engines. The load in diesel 
engines is controlled by varying the amount of fuel introduced in to the cylinder. 
In SI engines the load control is accomplished by throttling the air intake and 
thus increasing the pumping losses. Therefore the SI engine suffers from lower 
efficiency, especially at lower loads.  
 
In CI engines the fuel is introduced in to the combustion chamber close to TDC 
(top dead centre), i.e. the fuel is introduced heterogeneously. CI engines also 
operate with excess of air. Compared to SI engines running under normal 
conditions (stochiometric), diesel engines emit less engine out emissions of HC 
(hydrocarbons) and CO (carbon monoxide). With the diffusion-controlled 
combustion in the CI engine soot is formed due to pyrolysis in the fuel rich 
zones (core of the fuel spray) [1]. This is not an issue with the SI engine 
operating with a homogeneous stoichiometric charge. Soot absorbs organic 
compounds, hence formation of PM (particulate matter). The development 
concerning diesel engines is therefore devoted to lowering the emissions of NOx 
(nitrous oxides) and PM due to the continuously toughened emission 
regulations. 
 
In dual fuel engines the main fuel is introduced either homogenously by 
injectors in the air intake or directly injected in the combustion chamber. The 
pilot fuel injected serves as an ignition source. When converting a diesel engine 
to dual fuel the combustion chamber normally remains unchanged and the 
compression ratio is therefore maintained on relatively high levels. A high 
octane number main fuel is therefore desirable to reduce the problems with 
violent pressure increases or pre-ignition. Usually the main fuel is introduced 
early on, creating a homogenous charge, the pilot is generally injected close to 
TDC. Even though the diesel fuel is injected after the main fuel injection it is 
herein referred to as the pilot fuel in DDF engines, which is not the case in the 
common practice with pilot injections where the pilot injection is introduced 
before the main injection to decrease the ignition delay. However, there are also 
similarities with the common practice of pilot injections since it is a small fuel 
injection used to control the combustion phasing. In DDF engines, if the main 
fuel is directly injected the pilot is injected first, followed by the main injection. 
 
Dual fuel engines are mentioned to be capable to reduce both PM and NOx to 
levels significantly lower than for traditional diesel engines. This is combined 
with the remained efficiency and, at certain operating points, possibilities of 
even higher efficiencies than to those of diesel engines [2]. However dual fuel 
engines suffer from poor low load characteristics. This is mainly because of the 
flammability limit of the lean homogenous charge which leads to incomplete 
combustion or in worst case absence of combustion. When the main fuel is 
 
 
5
premixed with the intake air an increase in HC emissions are also seen due to 
the impact of air/fuel mixture trapped into crevices in the combustion chamber 
during the compression stroke. There are several ways of improving these poor 
low load characteristics, for example throttling, EGR, increase of inlet air 
temperature or as a last resort, switchover to diesel running mode. 
 
The work covered in this report is divided into two parts. Part one includes a 
literature study of the diesel dual fuel technology (hereinafter referred to as 
DDF). The literature study covers earlier work that has been done regarding the 
use of CNG (compressed natural gas) and diesel in a DDF system. The study 
comprises the principal function of the dual fuel engine. Parameters affecting 
the combustion and emissions are covered in this section. Information in this 
literature study is based on research papers.  Part two reviews experimental 
work done with a single cylinder research engine. The single cylinder diesel 
engine was fitted with a CNG fuel system for experimental testing. Results from 
the tests are presented covering the low load region.

2 LITERATURE STUDY 
This chapter comprises the principal function of the diesel dual fuel engine. The 
influence of different parameters affecting the combustion and emissions are 
covered. Dual fuel engines covered in this work have used CNG (compressed 
natural gas) as main fuel and diesel as pilot fuel. The conclusions made in the 
literature study are those of the authors reviewed unless not told. 
2.1 Start of injection (diesel pilot) 
Ignition delay in dual fuel engines differs from those of the pure diesel engine. 
This is because of the main part of the fuel is CNG and it is introduced 
homogenously in the intake stroke. During the compression stroke the mixture 
undergoes chemical reactions and changes the temperature at the end of the 
compression stroke. Some parameters significantly influencing the ignition 
delay are: Temperature and pressure of the charge, gaseous fuel composition 
and concentration [3]. These parameters must be considered to obtain an 
efficient combustion during different operating conditions. 
 
There are several strategies when introducing the pilot fuel into the combustion 
chamber. These can be divided into two groups: 
 
• Diesel fuel injection after main gaseous fuel injection (homogenous) 
• Diesel fuel injection before main fuel injection (DI gas) 
 
The latter one is used when the main fuel is injected with direct injection (DI) 
and will not be reviewed. The first mentioned strategy can be divided into further 
groups: 
 
• Late SOI (start of injection) 
• Early SOI 
• Dual pilot injection 
 
 
2.1.1 Late start of injection 
The most common way of introducing the pilot fuel to the combustion chamber 
is with diesel-like injection timing. This is mainly because of the recent work 
being done on diesel engines that have been converted to run on CNG. These 
converted engines use the original diesel injection system and are thereby 
limited in the maximum possible advanced injection timings unless the injection 
system is fully electronically controlled. 
 
Considering late SOI, around TDC, at lower loads, advanced timing results in 
higher emissions of NOx, higher thermal efficiency and a reduction in HC 
 
 
7
emissions. At retarded injection timings the opposite occurs. However at high 
loads, an advancement of the injection timing yields higher emissions of NOx, 
higher thermal efficiency and relatively unchanged emission levels of HC [4]. 
 
Jie Shen et. al. [5] converted a turbocharged heavy duty diesel engine to 
operate in dual fuel mode with CNG and diesel. Data of the engine is shown in 
table 2.1. Three different injection timings of the pilot fuel were tested for three 
different running modes of the engine: Rated power mode (2300 rpm), 
maximum torque mode (1400 rpm) and low speed with high torque mode (1000 
rpm). The amount of CNG fuel delivered compared to total were 80 % on an 
energy basis. Cylinder pressure and rate of heat release were recorded for the 
different injection timings and they are illustrated in figure 2.1.

Figure 2.1   Cylinder pressures with different pilot injection timings 
 
Figure 2.1 illustrates the influence of the pilot injection timing on the cylinder 
pressure. The y-axes show the cylinder pressure in bar and heat release in 
J/crank angle degree and the x-axes show the crank angle in degrees. Six 
graphs are demonstrated, three graphs with cylinder pressures and three with 
rate of heat release, i.e. one for each operating mode. Three different pressure 
curves (three different injection timings) are seen in each graph except for the 
rated speed running mode. During the test the inlet temperature were held at 
approximately 55 oC. Observations of heavy knock were made when the CNG 
energy amount were 60 % of the total and the injection was advanced to 12 
oBTDC (before top dead centre) for the low speed and high torque case. The 
knocking is explained with the advanced injection angle prolonging the ignition 
delay, which increases the energy released during ignition. This led to an initial 
adverse combustion with high pressure increment per crank angle degree or 
 
 
9
end gas auto ignition. Additionally the air/CNG equivalence ratio is closer to 
stochiometric at the low speed and high torque running mode, which increases 
the risk for knock. 
 
Maximum cylinder pressure and also initial heat release rate are increased at 
low speed and high torque running mode with advancement of the injection 
timing. This was explained with the increased ignition delay which allows the 
pilot fuel to mix with a larger amount of CNG/air mixture and thus providing a 
larger initial heat release rate. The ignition energy in the first stage of the 
combustion involves the pilot fuel and the CNG/air blend mixed within it.  
 
Karim [6] described the combustion process in dual fuel engines by dividing it 
into three different stages. The first stage entails the combustion of 
approximately half of the pilot fuel and the gaseous fuel that is mixed within it. 
The second part is diffusive combustion of the rest of the pilot fuel and the 
gaseous fuel in the vicinity of the pilot. The third stage incorporates the flame 
front propagation of the gaseous mixture. 
 
Figure 2.1 shows that the prolonged ignition delay leads to larger initial heat 
release, which results in increased cylinder pressure. However at the rated 
speed running mode the effect of injection timing is less than low speed and 
torque running mode. This is explained by the authors with the equivalence 
ratio. In the rated speed running mode the equivalence ratio is lower, i.e. the 
gaseous mixture is leaner than at low speed and torque running mode. This 
contributes to a lower combustion speed and hence the cylinder pressure is not 
much affected by the injection timing at this running mode. Nevertheless the 
phasing of the cylinder pressure is changed with the change of the injection 
timing. No results of the efficiency are provided in the report during these tests. 
 
NOx levels during the tests were sampled and they are presented in table 2.2. 
Furthermore smoke was measured with a Bosch smoke meter and during the 
tests smoke numbers (FSN) measured were 1 or below.

2.1.2 Early start of injection 
Another injection strategy is the advanced pilot injection. Injection timings as 
early as 60 oBTDC are used. The advanced injection strategy is beneficial for 
reducing NOx and at the same time having an acceptable efficiency. However 
this is at the cost of variance between the cycles, that is to say an increase in 
COV (coefficient of variation) of the indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP). 
 
Singh et. al. [7] investigated a further advancement of the injection timing 
compared to the previous chapter and found that NOx levels were substantially 
lowered when applying very advanced injection timings (60 oBTDC). The 
concept is called advanced low pilot ignited natural gas (ALPING). The authors 
experienced the occurrence of shorter combustion duration when using this 
concept. The engine used in the tests is described in table 2.3.

Figure 2.2 shows the cylinder pressure and heat release history for different 
injection timings at half load. Engine speed was 1700 rpm and an inlet 
temperature and pressure of 75 oC and 184 kPa respectively were used. The y-
axes illustrate cylinder pressure in MPa and rate of heat release in J/crank 
angle degree. The x-axes show the crank angle in degrees. Two charts are 
shown, one for injection timings between 20 – 40 oBTDC and one for 45 – 60 
oBTDC. The presented rate of heat release results are averaged for 150 cycles 
and may therefore smoothen out interesting characteristics of the individual 
cycles. 
 
 
Figure 2.2   Cylinder pressure and heat release rate with different injection timings, half 
load 
 
As seen in the figure, the amount of energy released within the first stage of the 
combustion increase with the advancement of the injection timing. This leads to 
shorter combustion durations (faster burning time). When using further 
advanced injection timings misfire/partial burn occur. Observations were made 
considering the transition between the initial diesel combustion and the 
combustion of the gaseous mixture. In between the injection timings of 30 – 45 
oBTDC this transition is shown as an initial bump in the rate of heat release. At 
injection timings retarded or advanced from this region this phenomenon is not 
seen. The figure reveals that the start of combustion is not further advanced 
with a further advancement in injection timing from 40 oBTDC. Instead the start 
of combustion is phased closer towards TDC. This is a result of the pilot fuel 
leaning out to levels were ignition strength is weakened. 
 
 
12 
 
Figure 2.3 illustrates NOx emissions and fuel conversion efficiency for the 
different injection timings. The results for the fuel conversion efficiency do not 
account for the externally driven fuel pump or the effects of simulated 
turbocharging. Moreover results are from a single cylinder engine and cannot 
be directly compared to the multicylinder engine, but the trends would be 
similar. Two diagrams are illustrated, one for each parameter. The x-axes show 
the injection timing in oBTDC and the y-axes for the two diagrams shows fuel 
conversion efficiency in % and NOx in g/kWh at both half and full load. No 
comparison with the baseline diesel engine is made. As seen, NOx levels can 
be lowered to a large extent without a large sacrifice in efficiency with advanced 
SOI. 
 
 
Figure 2.3   Fuel conversion efficiency and specific NOx emission at various injection 
timings 
 
The authors also showed that the effect of increasing the inlet temperature is 
much more advantageous at advanced injection timings. At retarded injection 
timings (20 oBTDC) the inlet temperature does not affect the rate of heat 
release at the same extent as for advanced timings. This increases the fuel 
conversion efficiency because of the shorter combustion duration obtained with 
the higher inlet temperatures that increase the burning rate. 
 
COV decreased with the increase of inlet temperature for all injection timings 
but attained a lowest level of 11,5 % with an injection timing of 20 CAD BTDC 
and an inlet temperature of 105 o C. According to Heywood [1] COV of indicated 
mean effective pressure higher than 10 % is considered unusable in IC engines. 
 
Also, during the tests, the dual fuel engine suffered from high emissions of HC 
and CO. This was due to the high inlet pressure providing a high air/fuel 
equivalence ratio. 
 
Similar trends to those of the ALPING concept are observed by Tomita et. al. [8] 
 
 
13 
 
 
2.1.3 Dual pilot injection 
A combination of the above mentioned injection strategies is the dual pilot 
injection strategy. The main purpose of this strategy is to reduce the high HC 
emission levels at low loads in a duel fuel engine. 
 
Micklow and Gong [9] showed with a multidimensional computation that a split 
injection strategy could reduce HC emissions with 90 %, CO emissions with 50 
% and NOx emissions with 70 % compared to those of a single pilot injection 
injected at 30 oBTDC. The computational model used was the KIVA3V code 
developed by Los Alamos National Laboratory. The numerical study was 
validated by comparing with measured and predicted cylinder pressures. 85 % 
of the energy was supplied by CNG and the fuel/air equivalence ratio of the 
CNG was 0,33. The engine speed was set to 1700 rpm. The characteristics of 
the engine are described in table 2.4. Load was approximately 50 %.

The first injection is said to serve as an added higher hydrocarbon constituent 
whom will ignite weakly before the ignition of the gaseous fuel. The purpose of 
the first injection is to increase the temperature of the mixture before ignition in 
order to prevent flame extinction, i.e. extend the lean flammability limit. 
Approximately 2/3 of the pilot fuel is injected in the first injection at a crank 
angle degree of about 100 oBTDC. The second pilot injection with the remaining 
1/3 of the diesel fuel is injected at roughly 30 oBTDC. This injection is intended 
to start the combustion. 
 
Figure 2.4 illustrates the benefits of a dual pilot strategy. The figure shows HC, 
CO and NOx for the dual pilot injection compared to the single pilot injection. 
Three different plots are shown, one for each emission. The y-axes show the 
emission in ppm/kJ and the x-axes show the injection timing in crank angle 
degrees whereas 360 o is TDC. The reductions of HC emissions are obvious. 
 
 
 
14 
 
Figure 2.4   Emission levels of dual pilot injections compared to single pilot injection 
 
 
One problem with the dual pilot injection strategy is that if the first pilot injection 
is injected to early, the diesel spray impinges on the cylinder wall. And the other 
way, if the first pilot is injected too late fewer diesel droplets will reach the 
squish area. In between these injection timings the author found the optimal 
injection timing of the first pilot injection at 110 oBTDC and the second at 
approximately 25 oBTDC. The basis of the conclusion drawn from the optimal 
injection timing for the second pilot injection is shown in figure 2.5.

The y-axis shows HC emissions in ppm/kJ and the x-axis show the injection 
timing of the second pilot fuel delivery in crank angle degrees (first pulse set to 
110 oBTDC). Single point denotes the injection timing when using single 
injection strategy.  
 
 
2.2 CNG-ratio 
The amount of CNG introduced to the combustion chamber in relation to the 
total amount of fuel delivered is denoted as CNG-ratio. CNG-ratio can be 
defined on the mass, energy content etc. In other words, 95 % CNG-ratio 
indicates that 95 % of the total fuel injected is  CNG. High CNG-ratios can 
generally be achieved at high loads while at low loads a larger ignition source 
(more diesel) is necessary to allow initiation of combustion. However at high 
loads a large amount of pilot fuel (lower CNG-ratio) can cause severe knock 
due to the increased initial heat release [10]. 
 
Zhiqiang and Wanhua found that an optimal amount of pilot diesel exists for 
each different load and engine speed point [11]. Instead of pairing the result to 
CNG-ratio they used the equivalence ratio for the air/CNG mixture. The engine 
used in the tests is illustrated in table 2.5. In order to evaluate the amount of 
pilot fuel relative to the air/CNG equivalence ratio independently of each other, 
parameters were set to obtain the same heat release in each case.

Figure 2.6 illustrates the experimental relation obtained between air/CNG 
equivalence ratio compared to NOx, soot and amount of pilot diesel. Three 
dashed lines without markers illustrate amount of pilot diesel in mg/stroke, one 
for 50 %, 75 % and 100 % load. Three solid lines with markers represent soot in 
BSU (Bosch smoke units) at the different loads while the dashed lines with 
markers shows NOx in ppm. 
 
 
 
16 
 
Figure 2.6   NOx, soot and amount of pilot diesel for different air/CNG equivalence ratio 
 
 
The figure indices that there is critical amount of pilot diesel where a further 
decrease of the amount of diesel does not decrease soot levels but increase 
NOx. This is explained as follows. Lean burn strategy benefits from low NOx 
emission levels. However at very lean air/CNG ratios the diesel diffusion 
combustion increase with the increased amount of pilot diesel introduced to the 
cylinder in order to obtain combustion. This tends to increase NOx. On the other 
hand, at richer air/CNG ratios, NOx emissions increase as well because of the 
increased burnt zone temperature. This is seen for the case with 75 % load. 
Therefore, an optimal amount of pilot diesel exists at different loads. 
 
A further explanation of the optimal amount of pilot diesel is given from picture 
2.7. The y-axis shows the optimal amount of pilot diesel in mg/stroke and the x-
axis shows the load in %. As can be seen, the amount of pilot diesel decreases 
with the increase of load. This is owing to the shorter ignition delay. 
 
 
Figure 2.7   Optimal amount of pilot diesel fuel for different loads. 
 
 
17 
 
In contribution to the optimal amount of pilot strategy other authors’ points 
towards the use of a micro pilot strategy [7, 12, 13]. 
 
Beck et. al. [13] found that the optimal pilot quantity is the minimum quantity. 
They give an example in terms of energy contained in the pilot compared to 
typical electrical spark energy. 1 mm3 of pilot fuel contains approximately 36 J 
which is about two orders of level more than the energy from the electrical 
spark. This is beneficial for the dual fuel engine that may allow ignition of leaner 
air/CNG mixtures. Yet pilot spray characteristics differ from those of the 
electrical spark, spatial distribution etc. 
 
No information of the engine in the test is provided more than that the injector 
was modified to deliver small amounts of pilot fuel. The minimum amount of 
pilot fuel was evaluated by studying the injector pressure (when stable), misfire 
(cylinder pressure history and HC emission) and exhaust gas temperature. 
Maximum injection pressures used was 560 bar. The injector was an electro-
hydraulic electronically controlled unit injector. 
 
Table 2.6 lists the influence of engine performance obtained in the report. The 
pilot fuel quantity is denoted as Qp. No information is given on the air/CNG 
equivalence ratio used.

10 
At rated power, Navistar DT-466 dual fuel thermal efficiency yielded 24 % and 
18 % higher efficiencies (at the same NOx levels) than those of the baseline 
diesel. 
 
Soliman et. al. [14] investigated the effect of the pilot fuel quantity on the 
performance of a dual fuel engine. As generally known the amount of pilot fuel 
 
 
18 
has to be increased at low loads (considering no throttling) in order to increase 
the ignition energy and grant combustion of the lean gaseous mixture. At higher 
loads less amount is needed to initiate combustion, partly because of the richer 
air/CNG mixture, but also due to avoid knocking. This indicates, as mentioned 
earlier [10], that the amount of pilot fuel delivered will need to vary depending 
on the load. 
 
In order to understand in which regions of total equivalence ratio that greatly 
depend of the amount of pilot fuel introduced to the combustion chamber Karim 
et. al. investigated the flame spread limits in a dual fuel engine [15]. The 
characteristics of the engine used in the experiments are shown in table 2.7.

A pilot injection timing of 20 oBTDC and an engine speed of 1000 rpm was 
used. Figure 2.8 shows the concentrations of unconsumed methane and carbon 
monoxide in the exhaust gas at different global equivalence ratios for different 
pilot injection quantities. The x-axes show the total fuel/air equivalence ratio and 
the y-axes show the unburned methane concentration in % by volume and 
carbon monoxide concentration in % by volume. Three lines are seen, one for 
each pilot quantity injected. In the plot with carbon monoxide the results from 
the baseline diesel operation are illustrated. 
 
 
Figure 2.8   HC and CO for different total equivalence ratios and pilot injection quantities 
 
As shown there is a total equivalence ratio limit where the pilot fuel injection 
quantity does not largely affect the HC and CO emission. This is supposed to 
 
 
19 
indicate the limit for successful flame propagation from the pilot ignition points. 
A notation; the intake mixture temperature was held at -23 oC and the cetane 
number of the pilot diesel fuel was approximately 45. 
 
Figure 2.9 shows a sketch of unconverted HC and CO concentrations in the 
exhaust at different equivalence ratios. The equivalence ratios are divided into 
four regions and they are as follows: 
 
• Region 1: Combustion of pilot fuel only. Homogenous mixture too lean for 
combustion.  
• Region 2: Combustion of pilot fuel only. Homogenous mixture too lean for 
combustion although some pre combustion chemical reactions of the 
gaseous fuel are taking place. 
• Region 3: Partly flame propagation although the homogenous mixture still 
is too lean for a proper combustion. 
• Region 4: Extended flame propagation 
 
 
Figure 2.9   Sketch of HC and CO emissions at different regimes of equivalence ratio 
 
Because of the need of simple guidelines for estimating operation conditions for 
dual fuel engines Karim et. al. [15] further investigated the limit of flame 
propagation. It is concluded that the flame spread limit is extended with the 
increase of the amount of pilot fuel quantity. The same trend was observed 
when increasing the air inlet temperature. 
 
Shen et. al. [5], quoted earlier, examined the combustion characteristics with 
sweeps of CNG-Ratio at three different loads (table 2.2). Information of the 
engine used during the tests is located in section 2.2.1 (table 2.1). Figure 2.10 
illustrates the rate of heat release history and cylinder pressure when changing 
CNG-Ratio at three different running modes. The y-axes show rate of heat 
release in J/crank angle degree, cylinder pressure in bar and the x-axes show 
the crank angle in degrees. Three running modes are evaluated, low speed high 
 
 
20 
torque (1000 rpm), highest torque (1400 rpm) and rated speed (2300 rpm) 
running mode. Each graph shows different traces for each CNG-Ratio used. 
The characteristics observed is said to differ from those of naturally aspirated 
dual fuel engines. In naturally aspirated dual fuel engines, cylinder pressure is 
seen to decrease in comparison to pure diesel operation. However, this is not 
the case with the turbocharged dual fuel engine used in these test. 
 
 
Figure 2.10   Rate of heat release at different CNG-ratios and running modes 
 
As seen in figure 2.10 the initial peak in rate of heat release is seen to rise with 
the increase of CNG-Ratio. This is accompanied with the increase of inlet air 
temperature due to turbocharging. Moreover, the amount of pilot fuel is 
increased and thus providing greater amount of energy released at ignition. The 
 
 
21 
ignition energy in the turbocharged engine is larger than of the naturally 
aspirated one. However, at rated speed the cylinder pressure is reduced with 
increased CNG-ratio. Although the higher peak in rate of heat release the 
combustion phasing is retarded after and away from TDC. The cylinder 
pressure is therefore lowered due to the fact that the combustion is phased in 
the expansion stroke. 
 
Ignition delay is seen to increase with the increase of CNG-ratio at all running 
modes. 
 
 
2.3 Improving low load performance 
Load control in dual fuel engines are mostly accomplished by decreasing the 
main fuel flow to the engine. Conversely the air/CNG equivalence ratio will lean 
out to the extent where no flame propagation will occur. In other words, 
improving low load characteristics is one of the major challenges for dual fuel 
engines. 
 
Possibilities of improving the low load characteristics are: 
 
• Throttling 
• Hot EGR 
• Increased inlet temperature 
 
Additionally there are more parameters that could grant improved low load 
characteristics such as the earlier mentioned pilot injection strategy, stratified 
combustion of the gaseous fuel, lower engine speed, pilot injector geometry etc. 
[15, 20]. The effect of cylinder deactivation has been used in dual fuel engines 
to improve low load performance and is reviewed in earlier work [16, 17]. 
However all these solutions suffer from a relatively extensive hardware 
modification on the engine and are therefore not entrained in this work. A 
remark; there is also a possibility to switch over to pure diesel mode. 
 
 
22 
 
2.3.1 Throttling 
The problem related to low loads in dual fuel engines is the limit of the flame 
propagation because of the leaning out of the gaseous fuel. To prevent 
quenching of the flame propagation the air/CNG equivalence ratio can be 
increased by throttling the air intake and reduce the amount of air delivered. 
However, pumping losses will increase, albeit the additional pumping losses is 
surmounted by the increase of the combustion efficiency. 
 
Daisho et. al. [18] carried out engine tests to improve low load performance by 
throttling the intake air. The engine used is described in table 2.8.

Results observed, when operating with a throttled air intake, were much lower 
HC emissions compared to those of the unthrottled operation.  
 
Figure 2.11 illustrates the HC and NOx emissions in g/kWh and the thermal 
efficiency in % at different CNG-ratios with three different setups and for two 
different loads, quarter (left adjusted graphs) and half load (right adjusted 
graphs). The setups used were start of injection at 13 oBTDC with throttled and 
unthrottled operation, also the injection timing 20 oBTDC was used with throttled 
operation. The throttled running modes reduced air intake by 40 % at quarter 
load and by 20 % at half load. The reason for the change in pilot injection timing 
at throttled operation was the attempt to decrease the ignition delay (ignition 
delay is extended when throttling) at low load. The authors enlightens that the 
ignition delay was left almost unaffected by the injection timing. 
 
 
 
23 
 
Figure 2.11   HC, NOx and ηth for different CNG-ratio, throttled/unthrottled operation 
 
The general trends of throttling observed are reduction of HC emissions, an 
effect of the better overall combustion. Increase of NOx, especially at advanced 
injection timing, caused by the phasing of the combustion which moved closer 
to TDC. The increase of NOx with advanced pilot injection timing is also 
contributed by the slightly longer ignition delay providing a larger initial heat 
release, increase of temperature and shorter combustion duration. Moreover, 
the cylinder pressure was reduced almost linearly with the reduction of the air 
intake pressure. 
 
 
The authors also investigated the usage of EGR to improve the low load 
performance as well. The effect of introducing hot EGR at low loads were 
 
 
24 
considered to be the best alternative of the three alternatives, throttling, cold 
and hot EGR. 
 
 
2.3.2 EGR 
Another approach of achieving higher efficiencies at lower loads, as mentioned 
earlier, is the usage of EGR. Because of the above statement that applying hot 
EGR is considered to be the best alternative for improving low load 
characteristics, Daisho et. al. [19] further investigated the effects of EGR. 
 
The engine used is described in section 2.4.1 (table 2.8). The engine self 
supplied EGR from its exhaust and provided either cooled, partly cooled or hot 
EGR. The upper EGR ratio was limited by incomplete combustion. Therefore 
the EGR ratio was limited to 40 % at quarter and half load. The engine speed 
was held constant at 2000 rpm. 
 
The reason for investigating the influence of different temperatures of EGR was 
to study the effect of temperature on the combustion characteristics as well. 
 
Moreover the reason for the interest of investigating the effects of EGR in dual 
fuel engines was because of the possibility to re-burn the unconverted 
hydrocarbons and thus increasing the brake thermal efficiency and at the same 
time lowering NOx. 
Figure 2.12 shows the effect of the cooled, partly cooled and hot EGR on HC, 
NOx and thermal efficiency at two different loads, quarter load and half load. 
Three graphs are shown for each load. The y-axes show HC in g/kWh, NOx in 
g/kWh and thermal efficiency in %. X-axes show the CNG-ratio on an energy 
basis. Four lines are illustrated in each graph corresponding to the use of 
cooled, partly cooled, hot and no EGR. 
A notation; Knock was observed with hot EGR at full load for CNG-Ratios above 
60%. The full load results are not of interest in this section, however they notify 
the tendency of knocking and therefore indict the interest of further investigation 
in following chapter (2.5). 
 
Observations of water condensation were made when using fully cooled EGR, 
this led to unwanted condensate being fed to the engine inlet. 
 
 
 
25 
 
Figure 2.12   HC, NOx and ηth for different CNG-ratio, no EGR/EGR, low load 
 
As shown in figure 2.12 hot EGR yields an enchanting possibility of increasing 
thermal efficiency and at the same time providing relatively low levels of NOx. 
The improvements are higher at larger fractions of CNG, i.e. increased CNG-
ratio, except for NOx. 
 
 
26 
 
The reduction of NOx is largely bonded to reduced combustion temperatures 
and to some extent the reduction of exhaust gas flow rate. The effect of the 
reduction of the exhaust gas rate is indicated in the graphs as a dashed line 
without markings. 
 
With the introduction of hot EGR the combustion duration decreased to less 
than half of the duration compared to without EGR at approximately 90 % CNG-
ratio. The ignition delay was not largely affected by the hot EGR, although 
cooled and partly cooled EGR increased the ignition delay. The combustion 
phasing was retarded at partly and fully cooled EGR at high CNG-ratios 
whereas with hot EGR it was advanced towards TDC. 
 
Cylinder pressure curves are seen in figure 2.13 with quarter load and CNG-
Ratio of 60 %. The graph shows the delayed combustion phasing with cooled or 
partly cooled EGR. This is a result of the increased ignition delay of the pilot 
diesel at cold EGR conditions. With hot EGR the opposite effect is seen. A 
slight decrease of the ignition delay is seen with hot EGR. The effect of the 
ignition delay on the initial heat release is clearly shown. With the increase in 
ignition delay the initial heat release is increased as well.

27 
 
2.3.3 Heating of inlet air temperature 
Increasing the inlet air temperature is an efficient approach when improving the 
poor low load performance of dual fuel engines. Shen et. al. [5] states implicit 
that increasing the inlet air temperature is more beneficial than a decrease of 
the CNG-ratio to improve combustion. This is because of the more perceptible 
influence of inlet air heating on the maximum combustion pressures compared 
to CNG-ratio. In addition, ignition delay decreases with an increase of inlet air 
temperature. However, the results obtained are at full load operation but 
information covering the effect of inlet air heating reveals the usage of air 
heating at low loads as well. 
 
The engine used in the tests is described in chapter 2.2.1 (table 2.1) and the 
different operating points are covered in table 2.2. Cylinder pressure and heat 
release rate history is shown in figure 2.14 at different inlet air temperatures. 
The unit of the y-axes of heat release is in J/crank angle degree and the unit of 
y-axes of cylinder pressures are in bar. All x-axes show crank angle in degrees. 
Different traces are seen for each different air inlet temperature used. 
 
 
Figure 2.14   Effect of inlet air heating on cylinder pressure and rate of heat release 
 
With increased inlet air heating cylinder pressures are significantly increased at 
high torque running mode (1400 rpm). And even more obvious, concerning rate 
 
 
28 
of heat release, the ignition delay is reduced with inlet air heating. The authors 
do not state the differences between the different appearances in the rate of 
heat release at the two different running modes. However the equivalence ratio 
is higher at high torque running mode. This and the influence of the engine 
speed could be the explanation of the HCCI-like (homogenous charge 
compression ignition) combustion characteristics. Besides, heat release is seen 
during the expansion phase, this could be explained by the diffusion-like 
combustion of the remaining pilot fuel considering the rather low amounts of 
CNG-ratio used (60 %). This denotes a possibility of a different combustion 
strategy at lower loads if air inlet heating is used (HCCI or flame propagation). 
At high loads this phenomenon is unwanted for the reason that knocking is 
more likely to occur. 
 
For the rated speed running mode (2300 rpm) the effects of the heated air is not 
as significant as during high torque mode. Moreover, the authors found that 
below a critical value of the air temperature the ignition delay is not largely 
affected (for instance 72 oC at high torque mode). No efficiencies are given 
during the tests. 
 
 
2.4 Knock in dual fuel engines 
Knocking in dual fuel engines are mainly caused by end gas auto-ignition much 
like the knocking in SI engines. Yet, diesel combustion noise can not be 
excluded. Diesel combustion noise is associated with large derivatives of the 
initial pressure history at the onset of combustion. In relation to dual fuel 
engines, a large amount of pilot fuel could give abnormally high heat release 
rates because of the ignition of the pilot fuel and the air/CNG mixture entrained 
in and in the vicinity of the pilot. It is not excluded that both SI knock and CI 
combustion noise can occur in DDF engines [21]. 
 
The operating range in dual fuel engines are limited by poor combustion 
acquiescent to large values of COV at low loads and by SI knocking and CI 
combustion noise at high loads. Karim [20] investigated the nature and origin of 
knock in dual fuel engines and found that the transition from no knocking to 
knocking is sharp, well defined and repeatable. The heavy knocking at this point 
of transition yields sudden changes in the cylinder pressure history. Knocking 
was observed as highly frequent oscillating cylinder pressure traces (SI knock). 
Karim explains the dominating factors, influencing knock, as the nature of the 
gaseous fuel (octane number and equivalence ratio), inlet air temperature and 
at a lower degree the quantity of pilot fuel. 
 
Saidi et. al. [22] studied knock with a numerical model that had been validated 
with experimental results and work done by other researchers. The engine used 
in the test bed is illustrated in table 2.9.

The tests were performed with approximately 90% diesel substitution on an 
energy basis at part and full load. The authors found that a decrease of air/CNG 
equivalence ratio not explicitly strengthens knock. This is believed to depend on 
the higher heat capacity of the air/CNG mixture that decreases the reaction 
activities of the mixture during the compression stroke. Furthermore their results 
indicate that the engine is more sensitive to knock at lower speeds. The reason 
for this is not stated. However, at lower engine speeds more time is given to 
chemical pre-reactions such as cool flames which is strongly time dependent. It 
is likely that this is one of the reasons for the increased sensitivity for knocking 
at lower speeds. 
 
As mentioned earlier in section 2.4.2 end gas auto ignition occurred at full load 
when using hot EGR and with CNG-ratios above 60 %. Although hot EGR 
yields better combustion of the premixed gaseous mixture there is a limitation 
when the air/CNG equivalence ratio is decreased. 
 
Kubesh and Brehob [21] studied knock in a dual fuel engine. They used a 
Waukesha CFR (cooperative fuel research) engine equipped to operate on dual 
fuel. No further description of the engine was given more than it utilized IDI and 
used a CR of 16:1. Intake temperatures in the tests were varied from 66-110 oC, 
overall air/fuel equivalence ratio was held at 1.43. The natural gas used 
contained 97,5% methane. The premixed air/CNG equivalence ratio was varied 
between 2 - 5. They found that diesel combustion noise occurred at high CNG-
ratios and in general tests with premixed air/CNG equivalence ratios of 2 gave 
both diesel combustion noise and SI knock. 
 
 
30 
 
Figure 2.15 illustrates the results obtained for both SI knocking and diesel 
combustion noise. Two graphs are seen, one for FFT (fast fourier transform) 
analysis for SI-knock and one for pressure rise rate for diesel combustion noise. 
For the FFT power map the vertical axis show the FFT power (knocking power). 
The other two horizontal axes shows premixed CNG/air equivalence ratio and 
inlet air temperature in K. The maximum rate of pressure rise map shows the 
diesel combustion noise. The vertical axis illustrates the derivative of the 
cylinder pressure in (kPa/crank angle degree). The two horizontal axes are the 
same as in the FFT power map. 
 
 
Figure 2.15   SI Knock intensity respectively CI combustion noise in a dual fuel engine 
 
As can be seen, and as previously acknowledged, an increase in inlet air 
temperature, as well as an enrichment of the gaseous mixture, intensifies the 
frequency of end gas auto ignition. Maximum rate of pressure rise was 8,5 
 
 
31 
bar/crank angle degree where 6 bar/crank angle degree is said to be the limit of 
knock. The increase of diesel combustion noise is encountered with the 
increase of CNG introduced to the combustion chamber. This is due to the 
presence of the premixed fuel leading to longer ignition delays, longer time for 
the pilot fuel to mix and therefore a larger initial energy released at ignition. 
Also; both pressure rise combustion noise and end gas knock is seen at the 
same time. 
 
 
2.5 Emissions 
One stated benefit of dual fuel engines, considering emissions, is the reduction 
of NOx and at the same time offering almost soot free combustion with a large 
substitution of diesel fuel. The reduction of NOx is realized with a small amount 
of pilot fuel and lean air/CNG mixtures. Smaller amounts of pilot fuel decrease 
the locally stochiometric zones and thus lowering NOx. Another strategy is, as 
mentioned before, early injection of the pilot fuel in order to prevent locally rich 
zones. The early injection permits the pilot fuel to mix better with the air/CNG 
mixture, the pilot fuel zones are leaner and high combustion temperatures are 
avoided hence decreasing NOx generation. With the poor low load performance 
of dual fuel engines, one possibility of improvement is a decrease of the CNG-
ratio in order to increase the energy of the pilot ignition. That is to say, at low 
loads most generation of NOx is from the pilot fuel. However at higher loads the 
opposite occur. This is because of the lessened amount of pilot fuel needed for 
initiation of combustion of the closer to stoichiometric air/CNG mixture. The 
generation of NOx is hereby contributed by the overall richer mixture associated 
with higher burning rates and temperatures. 
 
There are several uncertainties considering the emission levels of NOx in dual 
fuel engines. Different researchers have reported different trends when dual 
fuelling a diesel engine. Wong et. al. [23] summarized the results from different 
researchers and found that the levels of NOx is ranging from lowered at all 
engine operating loads to only lowered in lower loads and, even further, an 
increase in NOx at all operating conditions. The reason for the wide spread 
trends, considering NOx, when using dual fuel is not mentioned but would 
depend on the geometry of the combustion chamber (piston), injector geometry 
(injector pressure, number of holes, spray angle, pre-chamber), injection 
strategy (early, late, micro-pilot), fuel composition (pilot and main fuel), CNG-
ratio (lowest amount of pilot fuel delivered) etc. To summarize, there are many 
parameters that could affect the combustion properties in dual fuel engines and 
more knowledge is needed in order to fully describe their influence more 
precisely. 
 
Particles are generally not an issue in dual fuel engines, unless low substitution 
of diesel fuel. The reason for this is that a large part of the fuel is homogenously 
mixed before start of combustion. Morevoer the lower carbon content in CNG 
contributes as well.  
 
 
32 
 
HC emissions in dual fuel engines are generally higher compared to the 
baseline diesel. This is due to the nature of the premixed charge being forced 
into crevices during the compression stroke, piston ring blow by, low ignitability 
at higher air fractions, flame quench at the cylinder walls, bulk quench and, if 
overlapped valve-timing, bypassing of unburned mixture. The possible use of an 
oxidation catalyst could lower these levels, however the low exhaust gas 
temperatures at low loads is a crucial factor to overcome to obtain light off 
temperatures. Moreover methane is considered to be relatively unreactive thus 
adding up the setback in oxidation of HC. A reverse flow catalytic converter 
could allow high reductions of HC at low exhaust gas temperatures. However, 
the catalytic process has to be started with either a high load running mode or 
by preheating [23]. At a critical point, i.e. the flame spread limit of the gaseous 
mixture, the fraction of the unconverted methane will decrease. 
 
CO emissions are of concern in dual fuel engines as well. The generation of CO 
is not crucial in dual fuel engines at high loads due to higher temperatures 
allowing conversion of CO to CO2. When leaning out the gaseous mixture, the 
combustion temperature is lowered and subsequently increasing CO because 
of the time available for conversion has been lowered. At a further decrease of 
equivalence ratio CO will start to decrease because of the lack of combustion. 
This is also illustrated by Karim in figure 2.8, section 2.3. 
 
 
2.6 Injector geometry 
Not much information is found on the injector geometry affecting the combustion 
process in dual fuel engines. In general, the main problem with the injection 
system is to provide a low amount of pilot diesel fuel with repeatability. The 
limiting factor of the lowest amount possibly delivered will come back to the 
amount of diesel injected at pure diesel operation at idling. This is crucial at 
higher loads when less amount of pilot fuel is required. This is however not an 
issue at lower loads, if throttling is not used, due to the larger amount of pilot 
fuel needed to initiate combustion of the lean gaseous mixture. 
 
Beck et. al. [13] developed a pilot fuel injector for small delivery of pilot fuel 
(maximum of ~ 20 mm3/injection). This was accomplished with a modified 
electro-hydraulic electronically controlled unit injector. The minimum pilot fuel 
delivery was 2 mm3/injection. Further observations during the evaluation are 
shown for full load in table 2.6. The authors’ summaries that further 
improvements can be made in order to improve ignitability of lean air/CNG 
mixtures. These improvements are said to be granted by optimization of the 
spatial distribution and the quality of the pilot spray. Yet, these results do not 
reveal much of the impact of pilot injection pressure and the spatial distribution 
of the spray (number of nozzle holes in the injector, spray angle etc.). 
 
 
 
33 
Mbarawa et. al. [24] investigated the injection pressure and number of nozzle 
holes influence on the combustion in a constant volume combustion bomb 
numerically. The results were validated with experimental results. The constant 
volume bomb is illustrated in table 2.10.

At first injection pressure was studied. The amount of diesel injected was held 
constant and therefore the nozzle hole diameters were increased with lowered 
injection pressure. Figure 16 illustrates the bomb pressure and the unburned 
methane in MPa and mg on the y-axes. The x-axes show the time elapsed in 
ms. 
 
 
Figure 2.16   Bomb pressure and unburned methane emissions studied with different 
injection pressures 
 
The results show that a higher injection pressure is desirable. With a decreased 
injection pressure, the penetration of the pilot fuel is shorter. This is due to the 
initial rapid combustion that vaporizes the fuel spray rapidly. With a higher 
injection pressure the spray penetrates further into the combustion chamber. 
This provides a larger volume of pilot fuel mixed with the gaseous mixture. The 
authors’ states that the partial oxidation is increased with an increase of 
injection pressure thus providing higher overall temperatures and larger 
combustion zones. 
 
 
 
34 
The effect of the number of nozzle holes is illustrated in figure 2.17. The y-axes 
for show the chamber pressure in MPa and unburned methane in mg. The x-
axes show the time elapsed in ms. Three different nozzles were tested with 
different number of holes. The amount of pilot diesel injected is held constant 
for all cases and therefore the nozzle hole diameter is changed. 
 
 
 
Figure 2.17   Bomb pressure and unburned methane emissions studied with different 
nozzle hole diameters 
 
The pressure increases faster with more nozzle holes. This is explained by the 
authors as the effect of that more CNG is ignited early in the combustion 
process. No influence on the ignition delay was observed. 
 
Additionally, due to the cooling effect of the diesel flow through the injector, one 
concern is to make sure that the injector does not get overheated when injecting 
small amounts of diesel. This could be an issue at high loads and high CNG-
ratios.

2.7 Summary of literature study - part 1 
During the literature study it was found that most research was related to heavy 
duty diesel engines. Yet, some information found, covered the medium duty 
(bore of approximately less than 100 mm) diesel engines. Table 2.11 
summarizes the distribution between the different reports read. Moreover the 
table illustrates the usage of the information in this report. The purpose of the 
table is to confirm the relevancy of the information in the literature study as if 
one were to compare with either a heavy duty or medium duty dual fuel engine. 
The literature study covered more than 100 research papers, where 
approximately 50 % of them were read in means by quality and/or relevancy. 
The papers column show the total numbers of reports and the unread column 
indicates the number of reports not further investigated.

3 PROPERTIES OF THE ONE CYLINDER TEST BED  
This chapter describes the engine test bed with a one cylinder diesel engine 
that has been equipped with a CNG fuel delivery system. The hardware of the 
system, the implementation of each component added as well as the data 
acquisition are described. 
 
3.1 Engine overview 
The engine used in the test bed was a one cylinder research engine based on a 
Scania D12. Besides the original engine hardware a CNG fuel system was 
added. Engine data are specified in table 3.1 and the engine is shown in figure 
3.1.

3.2 Test bed overview 
A simplified schematic figure of the test bed layout is seen in figure 3.2. The 
engine and the engine brake are represented as blue colored blocks. The green 
colored piping illustrates the gas line, this system is described in detail in 
chapter 3.3.  
 
The purple colored piping illustrates the diesel fuel delivery system. The engine 
is equipped with a common rail direct injection system, the common rail 
pressure is generated by an externally driven high pressure pump. The 
common rail pump is seen as the purple colored box. After the pump, an 
accumulator is fitted to prevent pressure pulsation phenomenon.  
 
Inlet air and exhaust air piping are grey colored in figure 3.2. Looking at the inlet 
air piping the air is led through a surge tank where temperature and pressure of 
the air is measured. The tank has also the function of heating the air with its 
heaters covering the tank. The inlet air massflow is measured upstream of the 
inlet air piping shown with a rotary piston gas meter. Besides, the inlet air 
pressure is fully adjustable from approximately 0,2 - 6 bar absolute pressure. 
The exhaust piping flows into a large surge tank where the exhaust back 
pressure can be adjusted by an actuator that adjusts the outlet cross section 
area of the tank.  
 
Emissions are sampled downstream the exhaust tank and a broadband lambda 
sensor is fitted beside it. Additionally the windows on the test cell doors were 
dismounted and new detonation hatches were fitted. The detonation hatches 
will open in case of an explosion inside the engine test cell. 
 
 
 
39 
 
Figure 3.2   Schematic of the engine test bed and measured engine parameters 
 
The engine brake is hydraulically maneuvered and the drive pressure is 
generated by a Saab SI engine located one floor below the test cell. This allows 
the possibility to motor the single cylinder engine without any fuel injections. 
Furthermore, the Saab engine can deliver stochiometric EGR to the intake air 
system were the exhaust gases are mixed with the pure intake air in required 
proportions. The amount of EGR introduced to the engine is measured by 
differential pressure principle. 
3.3 Measurement equipment 
This section describes the measurement equipment of the engine test cell, 
including temperature sensors, pressure transducers, emission measurement, 
opacimeter, flow metering and actuators for EGR. Pressure and temperature 
control are also covered. 
 
3.3.1 Temperature sensors 
Temperatures at the engine test bed as shown in figure 3.2 were measured with 
type K thermo elements from Pentronic. Besides the measurement points 
shown in the figure other positions such as engine coolant, engine oil, 
temperature at the rotary piston gas meter and ambient air temperature etcetera 
were also measured. Depending on the environmental impact on the lifetime of 
the temperature sensors, they were either 3 mm thick (exhaust port) or less 
(CNG temperature). 
 
 
40 
3.3.2 Pressure transducers 
Pressures at the engine test bed were measured with GEMS and WIKA 
pressure transducers of membrane type. Depending on the medium condition 
for the measurements to cover, the measurement range were different for the 
pressure transducers mounted, i.e. typically ranges for air inlet and exhaust gas 
outlet were 0-6 bar. CNG pressure after the regulator was 0-10 bar and 0-25 
bar before the regulator. All GEMS pressure transducers was connected by a 4-
wire installation except the WIKA pressure transducer that used a 3-wire 
connection. 
Cylinder pressure was measured with an AVL 12QP505clk water-cooled piezo 
electrical pressure transducer. 
 
3.3.3 Emission measurement 
Emission measurement was performed with a Horiba EXSA 1500 exhaust gas 
analyzer (single analyzer except for CO2). The emission bench measured CO, 
HC, NOx, CO2 (at inlet and exhaust gas outlet) and O2. Moreover an AVL 739 
opacimeter was used for measurement of smoke in the exhaust. The 
opacimeter was set up to show smoke in values ranging from 0 to 100 %.  
 
The emission probes sampled exhaust gases downstream of the exhaust gas 
surge tank (also for CO2 in the engine air inlet). 
 
3.3.4 Flow metering 
Flow measurement of the engine air intake was performed with a rotary piston 
gas meter of the model Aerzener G250 Zb 11.3. Flow measurement of the CNG 
was performed with a PEI Thermal flow meter with compensation for 
temperature and calibrated for measurement of gases at pressures between 7 
and 14 bar. 
 
3.3.5 Regulating parameters 
EGR was not used during the project; however it was calibrated using the 
Horiba emission rack analyzer (CO2). The EGR is not controlled by closed loop, 
only a control value is set to the regulator. Although, there is a possibility to 
have the circuit controlled by a closed loop. Inlet temperature and pressure was 
controlled by feedback from the air temperature and pressure measurement at 
the engine air inlet manifold. Exhaust back pressure was controlled by the same 
principle but with a valve. 
 
 
41 
3.4 CNG fuel delivery system 
A CNG fuel system was added to allow DDF fueling of the engine. The full chain 
from gas bottle to injectors installed is shown in a flow diagram in Figure 3.3.  
 
 
Figure 3.3   CNG fuel delivery system flow diagram 
 
The installation from the gas bottles (1) to the valve (8) before the flow sensor 
(9) is outside of the engine test cell. As seen, two CNG bottles (1) are 
connected to a manual valve (2) with indication of bottle pressure and a purge 
valve to purge the system. After the valve a regulator (3) is fitted with indication 
of pressure before and after the regulator. The first regulator (3) decreases the 
pressure from 180 bar (full bottle) to 12 bar. The purpose of this regulator is to 
supply the flow sensor with a CNG pressure within its range. For correct 
measurement with the flow sensor a pressure between 7 – 14 bar is needed. If 
the flow differs from this range incorrect fuel measurements will be registered 
and the calibration data for the flow sensor will have invalid correction factors 
thus giving an incorrect voltage output. After the regulator a pop off valve (4) is 
mounted. The function of this valve is to discharge the pressure and lead it out 
into the atmosphere in case of failure of the first regulator (3). This valve 
disallows that higher pressure than the level adjusted on the pop off valve is 
reaching inside the test cell. After the pop off valve a 7 micron filter (5) is fitted 
to filter the gas and minimize component failure downstream due to fuel 
contamination. After the filter a pipe-break valve is fitted (6). This device (6) 
stops the gas flow in case of a break/fracture somewhere downstream the fuel 
system. Downstream of the safety device (6) an electrically maneuvered shut 
off valve (7) is fitted. The valve (7) is opened when the test cell voltage is turned 
on. The next valve (8) is a manually operated tap inside the test cell for 
additionally safety. Next component in the gas supply system is the flow sensor 
(9). The flow sensor measures gas flow by infrared light and it has a thermal 
compensation for variations in gas temperature. Pressure and temperature of 
the gas is measured at the flow sensor. This is for supervision of that the CNG 
pressure and temperature is within the acceptable range for the flow sensor. In 
case of a too high or too low gas pressure the engine will halt due to a 
predefined emergency stop in the test cell control system. The gas pressure is

reduced even further with a regulator (10) before the injectors (11) to 
approximately 3 bar. The regulator (10) is conditioned with the engine water 
coolant which is set to 80 oC during the engine tests. Moreover automatic 
adjustment is made for inlet air pressure to keep the differential pressure over 
the injectors constant and solve the problem with compensation of injection 
duration at intake pressures above the atmospheric. After this last step the gas 
is supplied to the injectors which are of Keihin type and mounted at each inlet 
air pipe. The injectors have additional gas filtration and are actuated through a 
Keihin injector driver which is given a 5 volt logical signal through the control 
software of the test cell. 
3.5 Channel setup and calibration of sensors 
Beside the measurement points illustrated in figure 3.1 a big amount of other 
measurements were accomplished by sensors of different types. The most 
important sensors were calibrated, including temperature and pressure sensors 
and an actuator for EGR flow into the test engine air inlet piping. This section 
describes formulas behind the calculated channels, other measurement 
principles (thermocouple, pressure transducer etc.) are assumed to be 
generally known and therefore not discussed. 
3.5.1 Efficiency

As seen, CNG-ratio is defined as amount of energy from CNG introduced to the 
engine in percentage where 0 % CNG-ratio is pure diesel mode. 
3.5.3 Lambda 
The lambda value for both the total mixture and the CNG mixture is calculated 
from the fuel flow. The reason for the calculation is due to potential errors when 
measuring with a broadband lambda sensor without correction for different 
CNG-ratio. The lambda value calculation for the total mixture is shown in 
equation 3:

As seen, the stochiometric air fuel mixture ratio is approximated to 14.5 to 
simplificate the calculation of lambda since the two different fuels have similar 
stochiometric air fuel ratios. The reason for the approximation might seem 
incorrect, however, it led to that less calculated channels needed to be defined 
and therefore decreasing the software system load.

3.5.4 Carbon balance for validation 
For validation of the experimental setup a carbon balance (hereinafter called c-
bal) document was prepared for calculation of “carbon out of the engine” divided 
by “carbon in to the engine”. In this way any leakages in the CNG-system, inlet 
air piping, exhaust gas piping or instabilities in the fuel mass flow measurement 
and emissions measurement equipment can be found. The c-bal was calculated 
for every measurement made to validate or give indications on the preciseness 
in the measurements that were made. The c-bal calculation is illustrated in 
equation 5:

The c-bal should be 0 % when there are no errors in the measurements made, 
i.e. same amount of carbon mass in as out of the engine. However, there are 
always errors and the acceptance limit was initially set to ±4 % (at AVL MTC the 
acceptance limit is set at ±2 %). As a simple guidance the c-bal value is 
negative if the analyzed emission levels are to low or the fuel flow measurement 
is showing to high values. If the c-bal value is positive it is the opposite around. 
 
The emissions values are presented in g/kWh from the test cell software (raw 
emission values in ppm are presented as well in the software but not used for c-
bal calculation) and therefore conversions have to be made by multiplication of 
the measured engine power, this is not described further. However, correction 
for the measurement of 
2
CO  has to be made since it is measured in volume 
percentage of exhaust flow with heated sample lines. Therefore the values are 
corrected as follows in equation 9:

Where:

A notation; the average mole weight of the exhaust gas differs depending on the 
lambda value. In this calculation the mole weight is approximated to not change with 
lambda. However, the average mole weight changes it values approximately only in 
its first decimal. Moreover both CO and CO2 are measured on a dry basis thus a 
correction is needed since the exhaust gas in reality includes H2O. The test bed 
control system automatically compensates for the dry/wet correction for CO. For CO2 
correction needs to be done and thus the calculation from equation 9 needs to be 
corrected with a multiplication factor for dry/wet correction. This is not further 
explained in the report due to several difficulties which is discussed in the last part of 
chapter 3.7. 
 
 
46 
3.6 Real-time controlling 
The engine is controlled by a main computer with the software called “CELL4”. 
Instructions are given to six different PIC processors, which are able to handle 
port injectors, common rail injector, different types of actuators etc. The strength 
of the system is that there is a large degree of freedom in terms of functionality 
and adding different hardware, setup in the software and definition of different 
types of channels. One weakness of the system is that it is somewhat built up 
for evaluating measurements after the test and not during. For instance there is 
at the time not possible to show continuously updated cylinder pressure for 
longer times and at the same time incrementing the injection duration or 
changing the injection start. Nor is it possible to change the injection parameters 
by simply turning a potentiometer for a increase/decrease in injection duration 
or injection start. This makes the testing time-consuming although the controls 
of the injections are found to be stable when the software is used in a correct 
manner.  
3.7 Initial DDF experimental setup testing 
Before the engine tests were performed the newly installed gas system was 
tested to evaluate the installed components status and reliability. A leakage test 
was performed initially with pressurized air at 8 bar. At this pressure the 
injectors were tested with the engine motoring, injections were made and 
volumetric efficiency was compared with injection duration. This test gave an 
estimation of the injector flow rate compared to the mass flow rate signal from 
the CNG mass flow meter. Initially the mass flow signal gave values in NCMH 
(Normalized Cubic Meters per Hour) and together with temperature and 
pressure of the gas the mass flow rate was determined. Due to the possibility of 
changing units on the mass flow meter the signal was changed to kg/h without 
using the temperature and pressure to calculate the mass flow . The mass flow 
meter is of thermal type and has internal compensation for temperature if it is 
within specified range. During the engine testing the CNG fuel was held almost 
constant at 20 oC at the mass flow meter. It is therefore not a problem with the 
CNG fuel not being preheated. Although it is known that it could be a problem at 
higher loads when the CNG flow is higher. This is because of the pressure 
reduction at the first pressure regulator. The acceptable pressure range at the 
mass flow meter is between 7 – 14 bar. This is because the calibration of the 
flow meter were performed at these pressures. After the change in units the 
signal behaved better, however, a comparison between the injector flow rate 
and the flow rate according to the flow meter showed that there is a deviation. 
Figure 3.4 illustrates the differences between the expected values due to 
injector characteristics compared with the actual according to the flow meter. 
The figure shows that there is an initial difference in flow rate between the two 
different approaches of determining the CNG mass flow. However there is a 
linear correlation between the curves at injection duration times above 5 ms, i.e. 
there is a possibility to correct this with a new linear parameterisation for the 
CNG mass flow meter. The initial error for the thermal mass flow meter is 
believed to derive from the very low gas flows at lower loads. At these low 
volume flows the thermal mass flow meter is unable to register a flow change.

In figure 3.5 injector characteristics are shown compared to air mass flow into 
the engine. The data are taken from tests with injections of air instead of CNG 
in order to realize large values for duration. In this figure the expected port 
injector characteristics correlate well with the measured values of the inlet air 
flow loss due to the lowered volumetric efficiency when introducing gas through 
the injectors to the engine air inlet. The air mass flow meter was calibrated 
before the test and is expected to show reasonable values, although there are 
some deviations. These deviations are believed to be errors in the 
measurements.

A carbon balance was also performed which was within the selected margins 
when testing in strictly diesel mode. In the upper range of injection duration time 
 
 
48 
the fuel pressure was lowered, this could contribute to the offset at longer 
injection durations. 
 
In figure 3.6 the results from the carbon balance during the project are revealed. 
The acceptable margin was set to ±4 % deviation from zero tolerance. The x-

Measurement [#]
C-bal [%]
 
Figure 3.6   Carbon balance during the project 
 
As seen in the figure there is a larger error when in dual fuel mode indicating 
that the fuel mass flow measurement is showing to low values or that there is a 
CNG leakage after the thermal mass flow meter. The CNG-system was leakage 
tested and showed no tendencies that the fuel pressure would gradually 
decrease during time. Therefore the conclusion is that the thermal mass flow 
meter is sending out a lower voltage signal than expected. Initially the c-bal 
values were within the acceptance limit for the 3 first measurements in pure 
diesel mode. The reason for the measurement value number 4 placing outside 
the limit is explained by the very low engine load , 9 Nm. 70 % of the diesel 
mode measurements are within the limits whereas only 10 % of the DDF 
measurements are within the limits. However, it is important to add that during 
the testing the CNG mass flow calculation was changed from measuring NMHC 
to kg/h, i.e. no compensation for temperature and pressure was needed thus 
minimizing the calculation effort and contribution to errors. After the unit change 
the mass flow meter was experienced as measuring more accurately in terms of 
repeatability. There is however errors in the measurements which could be 
related to the low CNG flow through the flow meter. The last measurement 
 
 
49 
points showed more stability and repeatability than the other measurements. 
Measurements number 33 and above are made with injection durations from 6 
ms to 7,5 ms which were the longest injection durations used during the project. 
The CNG flow in these measurements is larger and thus believed to add to the 
stability and minimizing the measurement error. This is based on the same data 
used in the presentation of CNG mass flow in figure 3.5. One possibility could 
be to add a multiplication factor in the CNG mass flow measurement in order to 
correct the error. This assumes that the error is linear. 
 
As stated before, the test bed control system automatically compensates CO 
since it is measured on a dry basis. HC however is measured on a wet basis 
and therefore no compensation is needed. Dry/wet correction for CO2 was 
never performed because of that the CNG fuel composition was unknown. 
Without information of the fuel specification it is not possible to perform a 
correction for the water content in the exhaust gas. Moreover the CNG fuel 
bottles used had different date marks indicating differences as large as years. 
Besides, there was no possibility to trace the exact location where the CNG was 
taken from. Since CNG composition varies depending on were it is drawn from 
and during what time, no more time was put into achieving an acceptable 
carbon balance. For example, a change of the carbon/hydrogen ratio (less 
hydrogen) would give a change in the right direction due to the lowered mole 
weight of CNG which would contribute to a lowered carbon balance result. 
Another explanation is that the CNG mass flow meter is incorrectly calibrated 
with a too low multiplication factor. This would yield an increasing error when 
increasing the CNG mass flow. Another contribution to the error in the carbon 
balance is originated from the HC response of the emission analyser. The HC 
emission analyser is calibrated with propane. However since CNG mostly 
contains methane the emission measurement will show values approximately 
10% less than reality. 
 
The points of measurement used for the c-bal are revealed in appendix 1.

3.8 Pilot start of injection 
As an initial test, in order to get to know the behaviour of the DDF engine a pilot 
injection angle sweep was made. Other parameters were held constant. Table

The column “value” shows the demanded value or as for the case with CNG 
mass flow the calculated value from injector characteristics. Due to problems 
with validation of the amount of CNG injected to the engine the CNG-ratio used 
during the test is the CNG-ratio calculated from injector characteristics instead 
of mass flow from the CNG flow meter. Moreover the diesel mass flow 
measurements were not stable as can be seen in table 4.3 (COV 7,55 %). With 
the lower heating values of CNG (50 MJ/kg) and diesel (43 MJ/kg) and mass 
flows from table 3.3 the CNG-ratio was calculated to be approximately 45 % 
according to equation 2. A notation; the diesel mass flow measurement seemed 
somewhat high during the test. The torque output from the engine was close to 
50 Nm and indicated mean effective pressure (defined over the full cycle) was 
between 2,6 - 3 bar. Peak cylinder pressure seen during the test was 91 bar 
with the diesel start of injection at 25 oBTDC.

3.8.1 Emission levels 
The emission levels are shown in figure 3.7 for the variation of injection start 
angle for the pilot injection. The only parameter that was controlled was the 
variation for the diesel start of injection. Other parameters such as the port 
injectors control was set before the tests and never changed during the tests. 
Therefore, the combustion phasing is changed during the tests. This affects the 
pressure and the temperature in the cylinder leading to drawbacks with 
conclusions of the injection sweep. The x-axis represents the start of the pilot 
injection in crank angle degrees before top dead center. The left y-axis shows 
the emission levels in ppm while the right y-axis show the smoke opacity in 
percent.

Figure 3.7   Emission levels measured during variation of pilot injection angle 
 
As seen there are two local minimums when looking at the emissions of HC and 
CO. The initial decrease in HC and CO emissions when moving from 5 oBTDC 
to 30 oBTDC can be explained with the increased time for the diesel to mix with 
CNG. This allows diesel to mix with larger volumes of gas leading to a lowered 
octane index for the volume. The lowered octane index contributes to a mixture 
that needs less ignition energy to initiate combustion. i.e. longer mixing time 
with diesel and lowered octane index explains the overall better combustion 
with less HC and CO emissions. Moreover, the extra time that is given for the 
diesel to penetrate and mix with the gaseous mixture lowers the local lambda 
and contributes to larger combustible volumes. At approximately 30 oBTDC the 
HC and CO emissions starts to increase and reaches its local maximums at 50 
oBTDC. This is believed to be caused by piston wall impingement of the diesel. 
However it is not excluded that the increase also is affected by the increased 
 
 
52 
amount of diesel in crevices, although, the main contribution to HC and CO 
emissions at 40-55 oBTDC is believed to originate from wall impingement. This 
statement can also be confirmed when looking at the geometry of the piston 
together with the spray angle from the diesel injector. The position of the piston 
at 50 oBTDC and the injector spray angle is illustrated in figure 3.8. The figure is 
based on a rough approximation of the geometry of the combustion chamber. 
The figure is only intended to give an explanation for the increased HC and CO 
emissions and one should be aware of that this is only an approximation.  
 
 
Figure 3.8   Illustration of the piston position contra injection spray angle at 35 oBTDC 
 
If the injection angle is further advanced the pilot will not hit the piston. Instead 
the pilot will be scattered above the piston at the squish areas. Due to the large 
area to volume relationship at the squish areas the effect of mixture cooling will 
become more noticeable in these spaces. The added amount of diesel in the 
squish area lowers the octane index and increases the ignitability. However, the 
effect of over-leaning of the mixture, exposure of diesel in crevices, wall 
impingement and flame quenching leads to more HC emissions. The 
combustion of HC to CO2 goes through CO and the more efficient combustion 
at the squish areas leads to lowered amount of CO emissions. This could be an 
explanation for the local minimum of the CO emissions at injection timings 55 
oBTDC. A further advancement in injection angle will increase HC and CO 
emissions. This could be explained by flame quenching due to the overall lean 
mixure and/or wall impingement and/or introducing more fuel to crevices in the 
 
 
53 
combustion chamber. The increased soot emission indicates that wall 
impingement is a problem at these early injection timings, although the soot 
emission starts to increase at 50 oBTDC. When looking at the different effects of 
the different injection timings, a dual pilot strategy or even more injection would 
seem like a good strategy at low loads. Such a strategy could improve 
combustion efficiency and lower the amount of HC and CO emissions. At these 
low loads the main contribution of NOx is from the pilot injection. If the main part 
of the pilot is introduced early in the cycle the NOx emissions can be held low 
as well. Injecting to early (more than 70 oBTDC) will only lead to combustion 
instability, wall wetting and increased emission levels of CO, HC and soot. It 
has not been confirmed experimentally in this project that a dual (or more) 
injection strategy would improve HC and CO emissions, since no tests were 
made. However, the conclusion drawn from this dataset is that a dual pilot 
injection with the main proportion of diesel at approximately 60 oBTDC, the 
second pilot at 30 oBTDC and a final pilot close to TDC to initiate combustion 
would be recommended to evaluate. The purpose of the two first pilots would be 
to lower the octane index while the third pilot is injected to initiate the 
combustion.

3.8.2 Rate of heat release 
All figures of ROHR (rate of heat release) presented in this section are 
calculated from logged cylinder pressure traces that are visualised in appendix 
2. Figure 3.9 shows history for the rate of heat release for the first five different 
pilot injection timings. The y-axis shows ROHR (rate of heat release) in J/CAD 
and the x-axis shows CAD ATDC where 0 CAD indicates TDC.

Figure 3.9   Pilot start of injection sweep from 5 to 25 oBTDC 
 
Looking at the ROHR, when the injection angle is advanced from TDC the heat 
release traces changes as well. The combustion goes from “diesel-like” to “otto-
like”. Another, by now already known phenomena from the literature study, is 
that the further injection advance from TDC not always moves the maximum 
cylinder pressure earlier. With the advancement of SOI a clear trend is shown 
that the ROHR is phased earlier, although, the ignition delay is increased with 
the advancement. Moreover a shift in the ROHR characteristics is seen when 
moving from SOI 20 to 25 oBTDC. This change was also observed during the 
tests in terms of noice. The combustion noice went from “diesel-knocking-like” 
to a more silent and smooth combustion although the earlier phased ROHR. 
When looking at the cylinder pressure in parallel to the ROHR history one can 
observe oscillating pressure traces for all the injection timings shown in the 
figure except for SOI at 25 oBTDC. 
The initial peak in ROHR was expected to increase with the advancement of the 
SOI. The reason for this is that the diesel fuel is given more time to penetrate 
and mix with the homogenous charge. This is also seen in the figure when 
moving from 5 to 10 oBTDC. For even earlier SOI the initial peak is seen to be 
lowered, this is explained with the further advancement giving even more time 
for the diesel to mix with the homogenous charge. This would with the former 
 
 
55 
explanation yield even higher ROHR peaks, however the diesel fuel is leaned 
out to the extent where it at this point no longer contributes to higher peak 
values in ROHR with an advancement of SOI. Although the larger volumes of 
diesel mixed with the homogenous charge, the lambda values in these zones 
are lowered and therefore lowering the “multipoint” flame front velocity.  
The SOI at 25 oBTDC shown in the picture shows the cool flame phenomenon. 
Cool flames are also seen with earlier injection timings but not as clearly. With 
further advancement of SOI the ROHR phasing trend is changed and the 
increased ignition delays contributes to a ROHR phasing retarding towards to 
TDC.  
Figure 3.10 shows history for the rate of heat release for three different pilot 
injection timings, 30, 35 and 40 oBTDC. The y-axis shows ROHR (rate of heat 
release) in J/CAD and the x-axis shows CAD ATDC where 0 CAD indicates 
TDC.

Figure 3.10   Start of pilot injection sweep from 30 to 40 oBTDC 
 
The reason for the prolonged injection delay is explained earlier and it is arised 
from the leaning out of the diesel pilot which yields a longer ignition delay. 
Besides, the peak ROHR is lowered as well. This indicates a slower combustion 
which is seen with the longer combustion durations. The cool flame 
phenomenon is now more observable indicating that the cool flames originate 
from the diesel fuel and that it is time dependent. During the tests the 
combustion noice was further reduced with earlier injection timings. The reason 
is partly evident in the figure due to lowered peak heat release values but also 
because of the retarded phasing of the peak leading to peak cylinder pressures 
phased later after TDC. 
 
 
56 
 
Figure 3.11 illustrates the further advancement of SOI. The figure is formatted 
with exactly the same scaling and units as in figure 3.9 and 3.10. Going from 40 
to 45 oBTDC in SOI gives a, to some extent, surprising result; the ROHR peak 
is now phased further away from TDC breaking the earlier trends. The 
combustion duration is more compact, the ROHR peak is higher and in general 
the pattern of the ROHR at 45 and 50 oBTDC is closely related to the pattern of 
the ROHR at SOI 30 oBTDC. The reason for the shift in characteristics and the 
“break” in the earlier trend is not fully understood. However, keeping in mind the 
emission measurements and the geometry of the piston and the injector it can 
be explained with the distribution of the pilot fuel in the combustion chamber. It 
is likely that the diesel spray impinges on the piston wall and divides between 
the squish area and the piston cup. This choice of SOI is not beneficial for either 
HC, CO or torque output. However this timing yielded the lowest values for soot 
emissions. For SOI at 70 oBTDC the combustion was stable showing a COV of 
IMEP at less than 2,3 %.

summarizes at least two important findings during the tests. First; the observed 
change in combustion noice during the tests can be identified by looking at the 
pressure rise rate. Second; The torque output illustrates the impact of piston 
wall impingement at 40 – 50 oBTDC leading to a lowered torque output in this 
region. Notation; at 35 oBTDC the torque output is seen to rise although the 
lowered indicatet mean pressure indicating a measurement error.

Figure 3.13   ROHR and cylinder pressure for 4 different port injector durations 
 
As seen the phasing of the cylinder pressure was not adjusted. The x-axis 
shows the crank angle degree in oATDC, the left y-axis shows ROHR in J/CAD 
and the right axis shows cylinder pressure in bar. 8 different curves are seen, 
two curves for each port injector duration. ROHR and cylinder pressure are 
shown for 5, 6.5, 7 and 7.5 ms of port injector duration. Looking at the ROHR, 
when increasing load, the peak value of ROHR is increased. This is explained 
with the extra amount of CNG added to the mixture with the scattered diesel 
pilot. The effect of the increase of CNG is also contributed by the earlier 
phasing of the combustion due to the richer homogenous mixture. Moreover the 
flame front velocity is increased (starting from multiple points. The initial slope of 
the ROHR traces is also increased with the increment of load. The added 
amount of CNG places the cool flame start earlier indicating that the 
temperature and pressure in the cylinder affects the cool flame start. With the 
two longest port injector durations the ROHR changes characteristics after the 
maximum peak. Oscillating ROHR and pressure curves indicates that end gas 
auto-ignition is taking place, also a knocking sound was heard from the engine. 
This could be contributed not only from the end gas auto-ignition but also due to 
the stronger initial pressure increment. 
 
The engine settings used during the tests are presented in table 3.3.

4 EXPERIENCES AND GENERAL DISCUSSION 
The project was divided into two equally long time parts. Ten weeks of work for 
the literature study and ten weeks for installation and validation of the CNG fuel 
system including DDF engine testing. During the literature study it was found 
that there are numerous of reports covering the “DDF area”. However, DDF 
engines are still yet to be explored and the documentation can be 
complemented. A market scan, not included in this work, showed that DDF 
engines are used in mainly genset applications and large vessels. In these 
applications the engine is calibrated for running at a constant speed (except for 
vessels travelling in/out of harbours). The engine operating spectra is limited to 
knock limitation and misfire regions. Using DDF engines efficiently in road 
vehicles which are dynamically operated is a tough nut to crack. Especially 
concerning a retro-fit solution. Handling of the low load in DDF engines is 
considered by the author to be manageable and different strategies are 
reviewed in this report. DDF application in the high load region is however not 
as trivial as the low load region, if the low load region is considered as a minor 
challenge. Due to lack of time in the project, no time was given for testing at 
higher loads. DDF operation at high load therefore remains as a challenge for 
further work on the engine used for these tests. 
 
 
 
 
61 
 
5 CONCLUSIONS 
 
• Most of the research has been performed on HD engines 
• DDF actual challenging areas are:  
- Low load (due to flame quenching caused by lean mixture) 
- Knock (pre-ignition due to high compression ratio) 
- Emissions (HC caused by flame quenching. Combustion chambers 
optimized for Diesel and not Otto engine) 
 
• Problem areas - solutions / interesting areas to investigate: 
- Throttling (to keep lambda low at part load) 
- Hot EGR (keep lambda low and good fuel preparation) 
- Load and speed window (low and high torque limitation for DDF, 
especially the high load region) 
- Catalyst is necessary to reduce HC 
- Multiple injection strategies 
• Experimental setup needs further work for validation of the CNG 
measurement and the carbon balance to increase redundancy for the 
measurements.

6 FURTHER WORK / RECOMMENDATIONS 
For further work on the one cylinder engine at the ICE-department at KTH it is 
recommended to test/modify following: 
• Increase load and look at boundaries for DDF combustion 
• Use a multiple injection strategy at low loads 
• More testing of the CNG flow meter and new setting of its full scale 
• Add online cylinder pressure for safety at higher load 
• Order a “known” CNG fuel with specifications 
• Implement a new carbon balance formula 
• Add online carbon balance for easy online feedback 
• Improve control of CNG shut off valve (oscillating problems) 
• AVL Visioscope combustion studies with DDF 
• Add potentiometer to control injections

12 APPENDIX 2 
Green marked areas are c-bal values that are within the tolerance limit. In the 
DDF points the injection duration for diesel was set at 0,35 ms most of the time 
when using 1500 bar in common rail pressure. As seen, most measurements 
with DDF at the higher injector durations gives a high value indicating that the 
Horiba emission bench measures too high carbon levels, i.e. the fuel 
measurement shows too low values.
