To analyze the provided Swedish sentence and create a dependency tree, we will identify the tokens, their relationships, and their heads. Here’s the output:

```plaintext
[(1, Besöker, 2), 
 (2, du, 0), 
 (3, en, 4), 
 (4, sida, 2), 
 (5, om, 6), 
 (6, till, 7), 
 (7, exempel, 8), 
 (8, antivirus, 9), 
 (9, program, 4), 
 (10, kan, 2), 
 (11, det, 12), 
 (12, hända, 10), 
 (13, att, 12), 
 (14, det, 15), 
 (15, kommer, 12), 
 (16, upp, 15), 
 (17, ett, 18), 
 (18, litet, 19), 
 (19, fönster, 15), 
 (20, som, 21), 
 (21, tipsar, 19), 
 (22, om, 23), 
 (23, andra, 24), 
 (24, antivirus, 25), 
 (25, program, 19), 
 (26, ., 15)]
```

In this output:
- Each tuple represents a token, its index, the token itself, and the index of its head token in the structure of the dependency tree.
- The index of the root token (which has no head) is represented as 0.
