To analyze the Swedish sentence "Olika discipliners och individers sätt att agera och tänka i byggprocessen förklaras genom en intervjustudie som genomförts." and produce a dependency tree, we can break down the structure of the sentence as follows:

1. "Olika" (various) is a modifier of "sätt" (way).
2. "discipliners" (discipline's) and "individers" (individual's) function as possessive modifiers to "sätt".
3. "sätt" is the subject of the sentence.
4. "att agera" (to act) and "tänka" (to think) are infinitive clauses that describe what is done in the ways.
5. "i byggprocessen" (in the building process) is a prepositional phrase modifying how the actions are carried out.
6. "förklaras" (is explained) serves as the main verb, with "sätt" as the subject.
7. "genom" (through) introduces a prepositional phrase with "en intervjustudie" (an interview study) as the object.
8. "som genomförts" (that has been conducted) is a relative clause modifying "intervjustudie".

Based on this analysis, the dependency tree can be represented as follows:

```
[(1, Olika, 3),
 (2, discipliners, 3),
 (3, sätt, 4),
 (4, att, 6),
 (5, agera, 4),
 (6, tänka, 4),
 (7, i, 8),
 (8, byggprocessen, 4),
 (9, förklaras, 0),
 (10, genom, 9),
 (11, en, 12),
 (12, intervjustudie, 10),
 (13, som, 12),
 (14, genomförts, 13)]
```
