To analyze the Swedish sentence and create a dependency tree, I will use a combination of part-of-speech (POS) tagging and dependency parsing rules. Here is the analysis:

1. Speciﬁkt: Adverb
2. skulle: Auxiliary verb
3. de: Pronoun
4. krav: Noun
5. identiﬁeras: Verb
6. som: Subordinating conjunction
7. var: Verb
8. n¨odv¨andiga: Adjective
9. f¨or: Preposition
10. att: Subordinating conjunction
11. garantera: Verb
12. att: Subordinating conjunction
13. applikationer: Noun
14. som: Subordinating conjunction
15. k¨ors: Verb
16. p˚a: Preposition
17. mellan: Adjective
18. -varan: Noun (Note: I'm assuming "mellan-" is a prefix of "varan", but it can't be considered a token here because then I wouldn't be able to know what root is has, for parsing purposes)
19. har: Verb
20. st¨od: Noun
21. f¨or: Preposition
22. h˚arda: Adjective
23. realtidskrav: Noun
24. .: Period (Punctuation mark)

Here is a possible dependency tree for the sentence:

[(1, Speciﬁkt, 2), 
(2, skulle, 5), 
(3, de, 5), 
(4, krav, 5), 
(5, identiﬁeras, 0), 
(6, som, 7), 
(7, var, 8), 
(8, n¨odv¨andiga, 6), 
(9, f¨or, 11), 
(10, att, 11), 
(11, garantera, 14), 
(12, att, 13), 
(13, applikationer, 14), 
(14, som, 15), 
(15, k¨ors, 8), 
(16, p˚a, 18), 
(17, mellan, 18), 
(18, varan, 15), 
(19, har, 15), 
(20, st¨od, 19), 
(21, f¨or, 22), 
(22, h˚arda, 23), 
(23, realtidskrav, 20), 
(24, ., 0)]

Please note that Swedish sentences are typically complex, and their syntax can vary depending on context and pragmatics, which might make the results not always accurate and sometimes ambiguous. Additionally, while a statistical model can do better in terms of finding more appropriate relations and reducing ambiguity, the syntax trees produced here do not necessarily reflect the various possibilities. Therefore, these should be taken as possible, rather than definitive parses.
