To create a dependency tree for the given Swedish-inspired but English sentence, I will use the following steps:

- Tokenize the sentence.
- Identify the syntactic roles of the tokens (e.g., subject, verb, object).
- Build the dependency tree based on these roles.

Given sentence: "However, VIP make it possible to reduce the thickness of the building envelope and you can thereby increase the area for selling with increased income as a result."

Here is the tokenized version of the sentence:

1. However
2. ,
3. VIP
4. make
5. it
6. possible
7. to
8. reduce
9. the
10. thickness
11. of
12. the
13. building
14. envelope
15. and
16. you
17. can
18. thereby
19. increase
20. the
21. area
22. for
23. selling
24. with
25. increased
26. income
27. as
28. a
29. result
30. .

The dependency tree in the format (token index, token, head token index):

[(1, However, 4), 
 (2, ,, 1), 
 (3, VIP, 4), 
 (4, make, 0), 
 (5, it, 6), 
 (6, possible, 4), 
 (7, to, 8), 
 (8, reduce, 6), 
 (9, the, 10), 
 (10, thickness, 8), 
 (11, of, 10), 
 (12, the, 13), 
 (13, building, 10), 
 (14, envelope, 13), 
 (15, and, 16), 
 (16, you, 19), 
 (17, can, 19), 
 (18, thereby, 19), 
 (19, increase, 4), 
 (20, the, 21), 
 (21, area, 19), 
 (22, for, 23), 
 (23, selling, 21), 
 (24, with, 26), 
 (25, increased, 26), 
 (26, income, 23), 
 (27, as, 29), 
 (28, a, 29), 
 (29, result, 26), 
 (30, ., 0)]

Some possible improvements and adjustments to this result, and reasons for that:

* Verb tenses are more complex than represented by the current tree: 'make' is in present tense, 'increase' is also in present tense.
* Possible error: the role of the 'thereby increase... with increased income as a result' in relation to the first part of the sentence. 'thereby' is an adverb and needs an independent verb to function with.  Therefore, the structure starting with 'and' likely indicates an independent sentence trying to convey a causal-effect relationship with 'VIP make it possible...'
* How is VIP understood in this context?  As this will lead to how 'VIP' ought to be formulated within the grammatical tree.

For a further understanding one can see more complex parsing like PRO Drops, clause dependencies...  given dependency parse possibly lead one deeper but one may run risk if such factors in mind are to be ruled prior as shown parsing diagram would not demonstrate.
