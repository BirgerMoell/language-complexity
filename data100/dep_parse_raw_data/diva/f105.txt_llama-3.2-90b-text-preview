To create a dependency tree for the given Swedish sentence, we need to analyze the grammatical structure and identify the relationships between the words. Here is the dependency tree for the sentence:

[(1, Så, 3), (2, fort, 3), (3, man, 4), (4, misstänker, 0), (5, att, 6), (6, datorn, 7), (7, är, 6), (8, smittad, 7), (9, av, 11), (10, ett, 11), (11, virus, 8), (12, så, 14), (13, ska, 14), (14, man, 15), (15, genast, 14), (16, sätta, 14), (17, den, 19), (18, i, 19), (19, karantän, 16), (20, alltså, 22), (21, genom, 22), (22, att, 25), (23, dra, 25), (24, ut, 25), (25, alla, 26), (26, nätverkssladdar, 25), (27, modem, 11), (28, och, 29), (29, kommunikationsenheter, 11), (30, ., 0)]

Here's a short explanation of the relationships:

- The main predicate is "misstänker" (4), which has "sätta" (16) and "dra" (23) as subsequent actions.
- The clause "att datorn är smittad av ett virus" (5-11) is a subordinate clause, where "datorn" (6) is the subject and "är smittad" (7-8) is the predicate.
- The phrase "så ska man genast sätta den i karantän" (12-19) is the consequence of the main action, where "sätta" (16) is the main verb and "den" (17) is the object.
- The phrase "alltså genom att dra ut alla nätverkssladdar" (20-26) is a dependent clause that explains the consequence, where "dra" (23) is the main verb.
- The phrase "modem och kommunikationsenheter" (27-29) is a coordinate clause that explains the objects of the verb "dra" (23). 

Note that the analysis might not be perfect due to the complexity of Swedish grammar and the sentence structure.
