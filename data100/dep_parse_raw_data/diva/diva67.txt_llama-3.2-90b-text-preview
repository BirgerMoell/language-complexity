To provide the dependency tree for the given sentence in the specified format, I'll first translate it into Swedish, since the format and instructions are given for a Swedish sentence. Here's the translation: "Antalet experter som ansvarar för olika delar av designen bör dock hållas på ett minimum."

However, since you asked for the analysis on the provided English sentence, I will continue with that one. Here is the dependency tree:

[(1, The, 2), (2, number, 3), (3, of, 2), (4, experts, 6), (5, responsible, 6), (6, for, 2), (7, different, 9), (8, parts, 7), (9, of, 8), (10, the, 11), (11, design, 6), (12, should, 0), (13, , 12), (14, however, 15), (15, be, 12), (16, kept, 15), (17, to, 16), (18, a, 19), (19, minimum, 17), (20, ., 12)]

Note: For sentences in English, the subject-verb-object (SVO) word order typically influences the structure of the dependency parse tree, which is consistent with the output provided. However, the actual output may vary based on the specific dependency parser or grammar used for the analysis.

Explanation:

- The word "The" (index 1) is a determiner of "number" (index 2).
- "number" (index 2) is a noun and the head of a prepositional phrase, dependent on the main clause headed by "should" (index 12).
- The preposition "of" (index 3) is attached to "number" as it introduces the prepositional phrase "of experts".
- The noun "experts" (index 4) and the verb "responsible" (index 5) are part of a reduced relative clause that modifies the noun "experts".
- "responsible" (index 5) is a reduced relative clause verb dependent on the preposition "for" (index 6), which serves as its head in the clause structure.
- "for" (index 6) itself is a preposition dependent on "number" (index 2), establishing the relationship between the noun phrase and the noun.
- "different" (index 7), "parts" (index 9) and the preposition "of" (index 8) form another prepositional phrase modifying "parts", and "parts" is a direct object for the preposition "for".
- The determiner "the" (index 10) and the noun "design" (index 11) form a noun phrase that is an object for the second prepositional phrase "of ... the design".
- The verb "should" (index 12) is the main verb and the root of the sentence.
- The adverb "however" (index 14) is an adverb that functions as a modifier for the sentence.
- The verb "be" (index 15) is the head of a verb phrase dependent on "should".
- The verb "kept" (index 16) is a dependent verb on "be".
- The preposition "to" (index 17) is the head of a prepositional phrase that indicates purpose or direction.
- The determiner "a" (index 18) is a definite article that specifies the noun "minimum".
- The noun "minimum" (index 19) is the object of the preposition "to".
