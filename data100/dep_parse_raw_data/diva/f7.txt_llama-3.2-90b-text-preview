Now, let's analyze the dependencies:

- "Först" (1) is an adverb and doesn't have any clear grammatical relation to other tokens, so we'll treat it as a root, meaning its head is 0.
- "efter" (2) is a subordinating conjunction introducing a subordinate clause, so its head is the following main verb "imponerat" (7).
- "en" (3) is a determiner modifying the noun "diskussion" (4), so its head is "diskussion" (4).
- "diskussion" (4) is a direct object of the main verb "imponerat" (7), so its head is "imponerat" (7).
- "där" (5) is an adverb indicating a location and has a grammatical relation to the verb "imponerat" (7), so its head is "imponerat" (7).
- "han" (6) is the subject of the verb "imponerat" (7), so its head is "imponerat" (7).
- "imponerat" (7) is the main verb of the first subordinate clause, and its head is the verb "får" (22) in the main clause.
- "på" (8) is a preposition introducing the indirect object "gruppen" (9), so its head is "gruppen" (9).
- "gruppen" (9) is the indirect object of the verb "imponerat" (7), but since "imponerat" is its head, "gruppen" doesn't have any direct relation to other tokens, so we'll keep its head as the main verb "imponerat" (7).
- "i" (10) is a preposition introducing the location "skolans bibliotek" (11, 12), so its head is "skolans bibliotek" (12).
- "skolans" (11) is a possessive determiner modifying the noun "bibliotek" (12), so its head is "bibliotek" (12).
- "bibliotek" (12) is the locative object of the preposition "i" (10), and since "i" is its head, we'll keep its head as the main verb "imponerat" (7).
- The comma (13) is punctuation marking the end of the first subordinate clause, so we'll treat it as having its head as 0, the root of the sentence.
- "och" (14) is a coordinating conjunction, it has no direct grammatical relation to other tokens, so we'll treat it as a root.
- "efter" (15) is a subordinating conjunction introducing the second subordinate clause, so its head is the following main verb "får" (22).
- "sitt" (16) is a possessive determiner modifying the noun "andra" (17) "besök" (18), so its head is "besök" (18).
- "andra" (17) is an adjective modifying the noun "besök" (18), so its head is "besök" (18).
- "besök" (18) is the direct object of the verb "får" (22), but since we want to capture the fact that the main verb "får" is its head, we'll set the head of "besök" to the following verb "får" (22).
- "hos" (19) is a preposition introducing the indirect object "Julian" (20), so its head is "Julian" (20).
- "Julian" (20) is the indirect object of the verb
