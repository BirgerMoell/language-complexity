To create a dependency tree for the given sentence, I will analyze its grammatical structure. Keep in mind that Swedish is not the given language in this case. It seems like a sentence in English. 

Breaking down the sentence:

- "The suggested solution" is a noun phrase.
- "uses" is the main verb.
- "a translation layer" is a noun phrase, the direct object of the main verb "uses".
- "called Metadata FTL (MFTL)" is a non-essential clause providing more information about the noun "a translation layer".
- "where" is a subordinating conjunction introducing the subordinate clause.
- "ﬁle system metadata and userdata" is the subject of the subordinate clause.
- "are separated" is the main verb of the subordinate clause.
- "from each other" is a prepositional phrase, describing the separation.
- "in order to improve performance" is a non-essential clause explaining the reason for the separation.

Creating the dependency tree:

[(0, The, 2), (1, suggested, 2), (2, solution, 3), (3, uses, 0), 
 (4, a, 5), (5, translation, 6), (6, layer, 3), 
 (7, called, 6), (8, Metadata, 10), (9, FTL, 10), (10, (MFTL), 6), 
 (11, where, 13), (12, ﬁle, 13), (13, system, 12), (14, metadata, 15), (15, and, 17), (16, userdata, 15), 
 (17, are, 18), (18, separated, 11), (19, from, 18), (20, each, 22), (21, other, 20), (22, in, 19), 
 (23, order, 25), (24, to, 25), (25, improve, 26), (26, performance, 25)]

The numbers in each triple are:
- the token index (starting from 0)
- the token itself
- the index of the head token
