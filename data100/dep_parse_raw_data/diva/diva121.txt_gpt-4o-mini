To analyze the provided English sentence and produce a dependency tree, we first need to identify the tokens and their grammatical relationships. Here’s the dependency tree for the sentence:

1. Even
2. though
3. it
4. ’s
5. young
6. ,
7. it
8. has
9. already
10. transformed
11. itself
12. multiple
13. times
14. and
15. survived
16. both
17. super
18. expansive
19. growth
20. and
21. fire
22. and
23. depression
24. .

The resulting dependencies are as follows:

[(1, Even, 3), (2, though, 1), (3, it, 8), (4, ’s, 3), (5, young, 4), (6, ,, 5), (7, it, 8), (8, has, 0), (9, already, 8), (10, transformed, 8), (11, itself, 10), (12, multiple, 13), (13, times, 10), (14, and, 10), (15, survived, 14), (16, both, 15), (17, super, 18), (18, expansive, 19), (19, growth, 16), (20, and, 19), (21, fire, 20), (22, and, 19), (23, depression, 22), (24, ., 15)]

This captures token indices, their surface forms, and their corresponding head indices in the dependency structure.
