The sentence provided is in English, not Swedish. However, I'll still analyze the sentence and produce a dependency tree for it.

The English sentence is: 
"The purpose of this study is to design an education called Miljösäkrade inköp from the target audiences' knowledge, interests and attitudes, together with literature."

Here's the tokenized sentence with their indices:
1. The
2. purpose
3. of
4. this
5. study
6. is
7. to
8. design
9. an
10. education
11. called
12. Miljösäkrade
13. inköp
14. from
15. the
16. target
17. audiences'
18. knowledge
19. ,
20. interests
21. and
22. attitudes
23. ,
24. together
25. with
26. literature

Here's the dependency tree for the sentence:
[(1, The, 2), 
(2, purpose, 5), 
(3, of, 2), 
(4, this, 5), 
(5, study, 6), 
(6, is, 0), 
(7, to, 8), 
(8, design, 6), 
(9, an, 10), 
(10, education, 11), 
(11, called, 8), 
(12, Miljösäkrade, 13), 
(13, inköp, 11), 
(14, from, 8), 
(15, the, 16), 
(16, target, 18), 
(17, audiences', 16), 
(18, knowledge, 20), 
(19, ,, 20), 
(20, interests, 22), 
(21, and, 22), 
(22, attitudes, 8), 
(23, ,, 26), 
(24, together, 26), 
(25, with, 26), 
(26, literature, 8)]

In this dependency tree, the token 'study' is attached to the token 'is' because 'study' is the subject of the sentence. 'Is' is attached to the root (index 0) because it is the main verb of the sentence.
