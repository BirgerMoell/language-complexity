To analyze the Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we need to identify the grammatical relationships between the tokens. Here's the analysis:

1. Vi (we) is the subject of the sentence.
2. har (have) is a auxiliary verb, with Vi as its subject.
3. dock (however) is an adverb, modifying the verb har.
4. blivit (become) is a verb, with Vi as its subject, and har as its auxiliary verb.
5. mer (more) is an adverb, modifying the verb blivit.
6. civiliserad (civilized) is a past participle, and the object of the verb blivit.
7. och (and) is a coordinating conjunction, connecting two clauses.
8. slåss (fight) is a verb, with Vi as its subject (although not explicitly stated).
9. inte (not) is an adverb, modifying the verb slåss.
10. lika (as) is a preposition, introducing a comparative phrase.
11. mycket (much) is a noun, and the object of the preposition lika.
12. – (–) is a dash punctuation, marking the start of a subclause.
13. men (but) is a coordinating conjunction, connecting the subclause.
14. ändå (still) is an adverb, modifying the verb that follows.
15. för (too) is an adverb, modifying the verb that follows.
16. mycket (much) is an adverb, and the head of the subclause, with Vi as its subject (although not explicitly stated).

The dependency tree can be represented as follows:

[(1, Vi, 2), 
 (2, har, 0), 
 (3, dock, 2), 
 (4, blivit, 2), 
 (5, mer, 4), 
 (6, civiliserad, 4), 
 (7, och, 8), 
 (8, slåss, 0), 
 (9, inte, 8), 
 (10, lika, 11), 
 (11, mycket, 10), 
 (12, –, 13), 
 (13, men, 16), 
 (14, ändå, 16), 
 (15, för, 16), 
 (16, mycket, 8)]

Here the head token index is set based on the grammatical relationships and emphasis described in the original explanation.

However this output is imperfect due to difficulties associated with trying to represent a grammatic structure with a coordination using only triples; sometimes this structure appears 'flat.'
