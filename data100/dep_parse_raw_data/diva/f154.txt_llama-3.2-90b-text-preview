To analyze the given Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we'll break down the sentence into its constituent parts and establish the grammatical relationships between them.

Here's the sentence with the tokens numbered:

1. En
2. del
3. sötvattenfiskar
4. som
5. gädda
6. och
7. abborre
8. klarar
9. den
10. låga
11. salthalten
12. i
13. Bottenviken
14. och
15. norra
16. Östersjön
17. .

Now, let's identify the head tokens for each dependent token:

- 1 (En) depends on 2 (del), so its head index is 2.
- 2 (del) depends on 3 (sötvattenfiskar), so its head index is 3.
- 3 (sötvattenfiskar) is the subject of the sentence and depends on 8 (klarar), so its head index is 8.
- 4 (som) is an adverbial clause introducer and depends on 8 (klarar), so its head index is 8.
- 5 (gädda) and 7 (abborre) depend on 4 (som), so their head index is 4.
- 6 (och) connects 5 (gädda) and 7 (abborre), so its head index is 5 (or 7).
- 8 (klarar) is the main verb of the sentence, so it is the root and its head index is 0.
- 9 (den) is the subject pronoun and depends on 11 (salthalten), so its head index is 11.
- 10 (låga) is an adjective and depends on 11 (salthalten), so its head index is 11.
- 11 (salthalten) is a direct object and depends on 8 (klarar), so its head index is 8, but since it is a dependent of 8, it should have a higher dependency index. However in this model, multiple dependencies are linearized to the dependent head index that occurs last.
- 12 (i) is a preposition and depends on 13 (Bottenviken), so its head index is 13, however since 13 is not a head of the sentence it is logical to rewrite head index of 12 to 8 to clarify relation to other objects that 'klarar' act upon.
- 13 (Bottenviken) depends on 12 (i) which in turn depends on 8 (klarar) as a sentence object - its head index is 8.
- 14 (och) connects 13 (Bottenviken) and 16 (Östersjön), so its head index is 13 (or 16).
- 15 (norra) is an adjective and depends on 16 (Östersjön), so its head index is 16.
- 16 (Östersjön) depends on 14 (och), which depends on 13 (or 16) so its logical head index is also 8.
- 17 (.) is a punctuation mark and typically depends on the root verb of the sentence, so its head index is 8.

Here is the resulting dependency tree:

[(1, En, 2), 
 (2, del, 3), 
 (3, sötvattenfiskar, 8), 
 (4, som, 8), 
 (5, gädda, 4), 
 (6, och, 5), 
 (7, abborre, 4), 
 (8, klarar, 0), 
 (9, den, 11), 
 (10, låga, 11), 
 (11, salthalten, 8), 
 (12, i, 8), 
 (13, Bottenviken, 8),
 (14, och, 13), 
 (15, norra, 16), 
 (16, Östersjön, 8),
 (17, ., 8)]
