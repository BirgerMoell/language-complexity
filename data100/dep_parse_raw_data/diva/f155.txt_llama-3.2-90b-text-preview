To create a dependency tree from the given Swedish sentence, we will break down the sentence into tokens and analyze the grammatical relationships between them. Here's the sentence tokenized:

1. Därför
2. genmodifierar
3. vi
4. växterna
5. dvs
6. ,
7. man
8. ändrar
9. på
10. växternas
11. gener
12. för
13. att
14. få
15. fram
16. den
17. växt
18. med
19. de
20. egenskaper
21. man
22. söker
23. .

Now, let's identify the grammatical relationships between these tokens and construct the dependency tree:

- 'Därför' (1) is a subordinating conjunction and the main sentence starts with 'genmodifierar' (2), but 'därför' still shows the reason for the action, so 'Därför' depends on 'genmodifierar'. 
  [(1, Därför, 2)]

- 'genmodifierar' (2) is the main verb of the sentence and does not depend on any other token, thus it is the root (0).
  [(2, genmodifierar, 0)]

- 'vi' (3) is the subject of the sentence and depends on 'genmodifierar' (2).
  [(3, vi, 2)]

- 'växterna' (4) is the direct object of 'genmodifierar' and thus depends on it.
  [(4, växterna, 2)]

- 'dvs' (5) is a dependent conjunction (short for "det vill säga" - that is to say) and depends on 'växterna' (4) as it starts explaining the modification of the plants.
  [(5, dvs, 4)]

- ',' (6) is a punctuation mark and serves as a separator between the explanations of the modification of the plants, it depends on 'dvs' (5).
  [(6, ',', 5)]

- This is a dependent clause. The verb is 'ändrar' (8) and the subject of the dependent clause is 'man' (7), thus 'man' depends on 'ändrar' (8), not on the main clause.
  [(7, man, 8)]

- 'på' (9) is a preposition that depends on 'ändrar' as 'man ändrar på växten' (makes changes on the plants).
  [(9, på, 8)]

- 'växternas' (10) is the noun on which the action takes place and is a direct object of the preposition 'på', so 'växternas' depends on 'på'.
  [(10, växternas, 9)]

- 'gener' (11) is a supplementary noun specifying the things changed on the 'växternas' so it depends on 'växternas' (10).
  [(11, gener, 10)]

- 'för' (12) is another 'för' which is most likely used for introducing an adverbial purpose clause, depending on 'genmodifierar' (2).
  [(12, för, 2)]

- 'att' (13) is another subordinating conjunction and the main clause in the adverbial purpose starts with 'få', but 'att' still shows the purpose, so 'att' depends on 'få' (14).
  [(13, att, 14)]

- 'få' (14) is a main verb of a clause and is describing a purpose as it is preceded by 'för'. This is dependent on the main verb, which is 'genmodifierar' (2). 'få' also means that it is doing something for something else.
  [(14, få, 2)]

- 'fram' (15) is an adverb and serves as a location to the verb 'få', it depends on 'få' (14).
  [(15, fram, 14)]

- 'den' (16) is a specifier for 'växt' (17) indicating a single item 'det'. 
  [(16, den, 17)]

- 'växt' (17) is the direct object of 'få' (14), so 'växt' depends on 'få' indirectly via 'fram'.
  However, since this analysis method cannot deal with 3 value objects next to other related token-values we will choose the direct relationship.
  [(17, växt, 14)]

- 'med' (18) is another preposition indicating change and depends on the whole clause including the 'växt' and how it changed as a part of it.
  Since this analysis method cannot deal
