First, let's remove the bullets and analyze the Swedish sentence. We will consider the entire sentence including the English parts and the punctuation marks.


Here is the dependency tree for the given sentence:


[(1, Especially), (2, I, 3), (3, want, 0), (4, to, 3), (5, thank, 3), (6, My, 7), (7, academic, 8), (8, supervisor, 5), (9, Martin, 8), (10, Törngren, 9), (11, who, 12), (12, despite, 14), (13, a, 14), (14, heavy, 12), (15, workload), (16, have, 11), (17, contributed, 16), (18, with, 19), (19, a, 20), (20, lot, 18), (21, of, 22), (22, valuable, 18), (23, feedback, 17), (24, and, 17), (25, help, 24), (26, with, 25), (27, this, 28), (28, thesis), (29, .)].


Here is a breakdown:

- 'Especially' is an adverb that modifies the entire sentence and is not strongly connected to any one word.
- 'I' is the subject of the sentence and its main verb 'want'.
- 'to' is an infinitive marker modifying the main verb 'want'.
- 'thank' is the main verb that is connected to 'want', which means 'want to thank'.
- 'My', 'academic', and 'supervisor' all describe 'Martin Törngren', who is the person being thanked.
- 'who' is a relative pronoun that starts the dependent clause describing Martin Törngren.
- 'despite' is a subordinating conjunction that introduces the reason 'a heavy workload' that might prevent the action of thanking, but Martin Törngren contributed with valuable feedback anyway.
- 'have' is the verb of the dependent clause 'who have contributed'.
- The combination of 'contributed with' means 'have made a contribution, in particular, through'.
- 'a lot of' is an idiomatic expression meaning 'a great deal of', modifying the noun 'valuable feedback' and is further described by the combination of 'help with' that also explains what the contribution means.

However, the resulting dependency parse might still be debatable since there is no widely accepted dependency parse theory.
