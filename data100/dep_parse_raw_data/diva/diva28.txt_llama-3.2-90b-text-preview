To analyze the given Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we will use the following steps:

1.  Tokenize the sentence into individual words and punctuation marks.
2.  Analyze the part-of-speech (POS) of each token to determine its grammatical function in the sentence.
3.  Identify the head token for each token based on its grammatical function and its relationship to other tokens in the sentence.

After applying these steps to the given sentence, we get:

[(1, Arbetet, 3), 
(2, är, 3), 
(3, ämnat, 5), 
(4, att, 5), 
(5, kunna, 8), 
(6, utgöra, 5), 
(7, en, 8), 
(8, plattform, 10), 
(9, för, 10), 
(10, en, 11), 
(11, vidare, 12), 
(12, diskussion, 13), 
(13, kring, 15), 
(14, vad, 15), 
(15, som, 19), 
(16, är, 19), 
(17, rimligt, 20), 
(18, måttligt, 20), 
(19, och, 20), 
(20, möjligt, 22), 
(21, att, 22), 
(22, kräva, 20), 
(23, ., 22)]

However, keep in mind that the dependency analysis can be subjective and depend on the chosen theoretical framework. The result provided here is an approximation based on a general understanding of Swedish grammar rules and dependency syntax. A more accurate analysis might require a more advanced NLP tool or a detailed linguistic analysis.

Here's an explanation of how each dependency relationship was determined:

*   "Arbetet" is the main subject of the sentence and is dependent on "är" (the verb that agrees with it).
*   "är" is linked to the main verb "kunna" through the nominal predicate "ären tat".
*   "att" is an infinitive marker that introduces the subordinate clause and is dependent on "kunna".
*   "kunna" is the main verb of the infinitive clause that is embedded within the sentence and is dependent on "utmöre" which is itself dependent on "kunna".
*   "utgöra" is a verb that agrees with "plattform," which is its direct object.
*   "en" is an indefinite article that determines the noun "plattform" and thus the relationship is: "plattform" is the head.
*   "plattform" has as modifier "för" which indicates a dependency of "en" on "plattform".
*   "för" is a preposition that is dependent on "en" in dependency terms because "en" logically relates the object of "för" rather than, as syntax dictates,  'vidare diskussion'.
*   "en" is an indefinite article that determines the noun "vidare" is the opposite here because it matches 'plattform'. Noun "vidare" is actually an adjective describing the noun "diskussion". However "diskussion" is the head as described previously and in some types of dependencies it can have an inter-relationship to its verb, however here - 'kring' is the dependency head.
*   "vidare" is an adjective describing the object "diskussion".
*   "diskussion" is the direct object of the verb "kring".
*   "kring" is the preposition that introduces the phrase indicating the subject of discussion and is the head of "som" as it induces subject dependency with "är".
*   "som" is a subordinating conjunction that introduces the subordinate clause that describes "diskussion" and is dependent on "kring" but itself acts as depdent on an embedded clause describing the subject indicated in it.
*   "är" is the linking verb in the subordinate clause describing "diskussion" and is dependent on "är" which is itself linked as previously described.
*   "rimligt" "måttligt" "möjligt" are three direct object-complement forms "att kräva" which are introduced by "rimligt" with some ambiguity since each could theoretically be related to each other.
