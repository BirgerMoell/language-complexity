To produce a dependency tree for the given Swedish sentence, we first break down the sentence into its individual tokens and then establish the head-dependent relationships. The resulting dependency tree is as follows:

```
[(1, Mer, 2), 
 (2, specifikt, 3), 
 (3, syftar, 8), 
 (4, denna, 5), 
 (5, studie, 3), 
 (6, till, 3), 
 (7, att, 6), 
 (8, hitta, 7), 
 (9, grupper, 8), 
 (10, av, 9), 
 (11, företag, 10), 
 (12, ,, 3), 
 (13, i, 3), 
 (14, denna, 15), 
 (15, rapport, 13), 
 (16, kallat, 15), 
 (17, kluster, 16), 
 (18, ,, 3), 
 (19, med, 3), 
 (20, liknande, 21), 
 (21, affärsmodell, 19), 
 (22, och, 3), 
 (23, till, 3), 
 (24, att, 23), 
 (25, identifiera, 24), 
 (26, existerande, 27), 
 (27, affärsmodeller, 25), 
 (28, på, 25), 
 (29, den, 30), 
 (30, svenska, 31), 
 (31, bankmarknaden, 28), 
 (32, ., 3)]
```

This representation includes the tokens’ indices, the words themselves, and the indices of their head tokens based on the syntactic structure of the sentence.
