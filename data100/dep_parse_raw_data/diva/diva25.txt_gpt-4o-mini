To produce a dependency tree for the given Swedish sentence, we can break it down into its constituent parts and identify the relationships between them. The sentence is complex and contains multiple clauses, so we will recognize the main verbs, subjects, objects, and modifiers.

1. Vi identify tokens and their heads:
   - "Då" (Then) is often a discourse marker and doesn't have a head, so it will link to the main verb.
   - "det" (it) is a nominal subject pointing to "ingick" (was included).
   - "ingick" (included) is the main verb in the first clause with "att konstruera" (to construct) as a complement.
   - "konstruera" (to construct) serves as an infinitive verb phrase.
   - "en" (a) and "fungerande" (functioning) modify "prototyp" (prototype).
   - The main structure includes "har" (has) as the main auxiliary in the second clause.
   - "detta" (this) serves as the subject for "har" (has).
   - "medfört" (led) is the main verb in the second clause.
   - "att" (that) connects to "examensarbete" (thesis).
   - The final elements are modifiers for "karaktär" (character).

Here is the dependency tree based on the analysis:

```plaintext
[(1, Då, 2), 
 (2, det, 5), 
 (3, ingick, 0), 
 (4, i, 5), 
 (5, examensarbetet, 3), 
 (6, att, 5), 
 (7, konstruera, 6), 
 (8, en, 9), 
 (9, fungerande, 10), 
 (10, fysisk, 11), 
 (11, prototyp, 7), 
 (12, ,, 5), 
 (13, har, 15), 
 (14, detta, 13), 
 (15, medfört, 0), 
 (16, att, 15), 
 (17, examensarbete, 19), 
 (18, varit, 15), 
 (19, av, 20), 
 (20, övervägande, 21), 
 (21, praktisk, 22), 
 (22, karaktär, 16)]
```

In this output:
- Each tuple consists of the token index, the token itself, and the index of its head token.
- The tokens are structured to reflect the grammatical relationships as identified in the analysis.
