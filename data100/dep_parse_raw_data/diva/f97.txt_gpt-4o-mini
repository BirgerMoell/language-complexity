To analyze the provided Swedish sentence and create a dependency tree, we will break down the sentence into its components and determine the relationships between them:

The sentence is: 
"De storlekar som finns är 15", 17", 19" och 21" på de vanliga skärmarna12", 15", 17", och 18" på de platta skärmarna."

The dependency tree is created as follows:

1. De (1) is the subject of the main verb "är" (2).
2. storlekar (3) is the head of the relative clause introduced by "som" (4).
3. finns (4) is the verb in the relative clause.
4. är (2) is the main verb that connects to the phrase indicating what is being described (the sizes).
5. The numbers (5-10) are attributes connected to "är."
6. The phrases starting with "på" (11-14) indicate where these sizes apply, and they further connect to الأخرى words in a compound way.

Here is the dependency tree based on this analysis:

```
[
(1, De, 2),
(2, är, 0),
(3, storlekar, 2),
(4, som, 3),
(5, finns, 4),
(6, 15", 2),
(7, 17", 2),
(8, 19", 2),
(9, 21", 2),
(10, och, 6),
(11, på, 2),
(12, de, 13),
(13, vanliga, 13),
(14, skärmarna12", 11),
(15, 15", 14),
(16, 17", 14),
(17, och, 15),
(18, 18", 11),
(19, på, 11),
(20, de, 21),
(21, platta, 21),
(22, skärmarna, 19)
]
```

This list captures the dependencies between the tokens: the first token's index, the token itself, and the index of its head.
