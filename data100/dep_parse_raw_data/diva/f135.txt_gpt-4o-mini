To analyze the given Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we first identify the tokens and their relationships. The output will show each token's index, the token itself, and its head token's index.

The given sentence is: 
"Så sent som 1939 lades Sveriges enda stridsvagnsbataljon ned, och innan krigsutbrottet hade endast 78 miljoner av de extra anslagen hunnit utnyttjas."

The corresponding dependency tree is as follows:

```plaintext
[
    (1, Så, 2),
    (2, sent, 3),
    (3, som, 4),
    (4, 1939, 5),
    (5, lades, 0),
    (6, Sveriges, 7),
    (7, enda, 5),
    (8, stridsvagnsbataljon, 7),
    (9, ned, 5),
    (10, ,, 5),
    (11, och, 12),
    (12, innan, 13),
    (13, krigsutbrottet, 12),
    (14, hade, 0),
    (15, endast, 16),
    (16, 78, 17),
    (17, miljoner, 18),
    (18, av, 19),
    (19, de, 20),
    (20, extra, 21),
    (21, anslagen, 18),
    (22, hunnit, 23),
    (23, utnyttjas, 14)
]
```

In this output:
- Each token is indexed starting from 1.
- The root of the sentence is indicated by a head index of `0`.
- Commas are treated as tokens as indicated.
