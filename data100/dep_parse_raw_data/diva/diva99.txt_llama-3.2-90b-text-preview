To create a dependency tree for the given Swedish sentence, we'll break it down into individual components. The sentence is: 

"Prestationen mätes i huvudsak av hur stor kundnyttan är, där en av aspekterna är distributionsnätens tillgänglighet."

The individual components will be numbered starting from 1. Here's the breakdown:

1. Prestationen
2. mätes
3. i
4. huvudsak
5. av
6. hur
7. stor
8. kundnyttan
9. är
10. ,
11. där
12. en
13. av
14. aspekterna
15. är
16. distributionsnätens
17. tillgänglighet

Here's the dependency analysis:

- "Prestationen" (1) is the main subject, dependent on the verb "mätes" (2).
- "mätes" (2) is the main verb of the sentence.
- "i" (3) is a preposition, dependent on "mätes" (2) because it's describing where the measurement occurs.
- "huvudsak" (4) is a noun, dependent on "i" (3) as it's the location of the measurement. However, huvudsak here has a sense of emphasis ('mainly'), so it is dependent on 2 (mätes).
- "av" (5) is a preposition, dependent on "mätes" (2) as it's describing how the measurement occurs.
- "hur" (6) is an adverb, dependent on "stor" (7) because it's describing the condition of being 'stor'.
- "stor" (7) is an adjective, dependent on "kundnyttan" (8) as it's describing it. However, "hur" creates an adverbial phrase and hence stor and kundnyttan must be dependent on mätes and hence av so mätes has dependency to 'hur stor kundnyttan' so two separate arcs will lead to av and mätes for arguments marked SINF and CCONJ - its dependent 'är'.
- "är" (9) is a linking verb, dependent on "kundnyttan" (8) as it's describing the condition of the "kundnyttan".
- "," (10) is a punctuation mark that can be considered as a separate token, but the comma here is essentially pointing out that this sentence is an aside from "där en av aspekterna är". Depending on the context,  could potentially be considered as the main sequence joining "mätes" and "där" for continuation but since no direct relation, head is sentence 17.
- "där" (11) is an adverb, dependent on "tillgänglighet" (17) as it's describing the condition under which the "aspekterna" exist. Also 'aspekterna' head for tillgänglighet does not hold but is linking with distributions 'asp' verb root.
- "en" (12) is an indefinite article, dependent on "aspekterna" (14) as it's describing it.
- "av" (13) is a preposition, not having a dependency as all here means they make up general phrase but an alternative way where dependency here points towards (6-8) previous av by the sense of the prepositional usage.
- "aspekterna" (14) is a noun, dependent on "där" (11) for condition and it as CCONJ dependent on final  mätes - a CC.
- "är" (15) is a linking verb, dependent on "aspekterna" (14) as it's describing the condition of the "aspekterna".
- "distributionsnätens" (16) is a possessive noun, dependent on "tillgänglighet" (17) as it's describing it.
- "tillgänglighet" (17) is a noun, dependent on the verb "är" (15) as it's describing the condition.
