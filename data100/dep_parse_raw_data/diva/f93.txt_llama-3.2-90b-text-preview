To create a dependency tree from the given Swedish sentence, we'll break it down into individual tokens and then define the relationships between them.

Here's the tokenized sentence:

1. Anledningen
2. var
3. att
4. den
5. behöves
6. till
7. kanonerna
8. som
9. skulle
10. skjuta
11. efter
12. en
13. viss
14. tid
15. då
16. kom
17. datorn
18. till
19. användning
20. .

Now, let's identify the relationships between the tokens:

- "Anledningen" is the main subject (nsubj) of the sentence, so its head is the root (0).
- "var" is the main verb (root), so its head is the root (0), but it will be considered head for other tokens.
- "att" is a subordinating conjunction (mark) introducing the subordinate clause "den behöves till kanonerna", so its head is "behöves" (5).
- "den" is the subject (nsubj) of the subordinate clause, so its head is "behöves" (5).
- "behöves" is the main verb of the subordinate clause, so its head is "var" (2).
- "till" is a preposition (case) indicating the direction, so its head is "kanonerna" (7) which is the object of the preposition.
- "kanonerna" is the object (nmod) of the preposition "till", so its head is "behöves" (5).
- "som" is a relative pronoun (nsubj) introducing the subordinate clause "skulle skjuta efter en viss tid", so its head is "skulle" (9).
- "skulle" is the main verb of the subordinate clause, so its head is "kanonerna" (7) which is the antecedent of the relative pronoun.
- "skjuta" is the main verb (xcomp) with the same head as "skulle", so its head is "skulle" (9).
- "efter" is a preposition (case) indicating the direction, so its head is the next prepositional phrase "en viss tid" (14).
- "en" is a determiner (det) of the noun phrase "en viss tid", so its head is "tid" (14).
- "viss" is an adjective (amod) modifying the noun "tid", so its head is "tid" (14).
- "tid" is the object (nmod) of the preposition "efter", so its head is "skulle" (9).
- "då" is an adverb (advmod) modifying the verb "kom", so its head is "kom" (16).
- "kom" is the main verb of the clause, so its head is the root (0), but it will be considered head for other tokens.
- "datorn" is the subject (nsubj) of the clause, so its head is "kom" (16).
- "till" is a preposition (case) indicating the direction, so its head is "användning" (19).
- "användning" is the object (nmod) of the preposition "till", so its head is "kom" (16).
- "." is a punctuation mark, so its head is the last verb "kom" (16) which it closes the clause.

Here's the resulting dependency tree:

[(1, Anledningen, 2), (2, var, 0), (3, att, 5), (4, den, 5), (5, behöves, 2), (6, till, 7), (7, kanonerna, 5), (8, som, 9), (9, skulle, 7), (10, skjuta, 9), (11, efter, 14), (12, en, 14), (13, viss, 14), (14, tid, 9), (15, då, 16), (16, kom, 2), (17, datorn, 16), (18, till, 19), (19, användning, 16), (20, ., 16)]

Note: These relationships might be open to interpretation, and different part-of-speech taggers or dependency parsers might assign different labels or relationships.
