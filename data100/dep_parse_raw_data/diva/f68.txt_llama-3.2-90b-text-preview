To analyze the given Swedish sentence and create a dependency tree, we'll break down the sentence into its constituents:

1. Det - pronoun, identifier for the subject
2. som - relative pronoun, introducing a subordinate clause
3. indetifierar - verb, main action of the sentence
4. rasismen - noun, subject of the sentence
5. är - linking verb, connecting the subject to its definition
6. den - pronoun, identifier for the following noun phrase
7. främlingsfientliga - adjective, describing the following noun
8. agendan - noun, first part of the definition
9. och - conjunction, joining two noun phrases
10. motståndet - noun, second part of the definition
11. till - preposition, introducing a subordinate phrase
12. invandring - noun, object of the preposition

Considering the sentence structure and the part-of-speech tagging, we can create the dependency tree as follows:

[(1, Det, 4), (2, som, 4), (3, indetifierar, 0), (4, rasismen, 3), (5, är, 4), (6, den, 8), (7, främlingsfientliga, 8), (8, agendan, 9), (9, och, 0), (10, motståndet, 9), (11, till, 10), (12, invandring, 10)]

However, since "och" is acting more like a coordinating conjunction and connecting "agendan" to "motståndet", the correct dependency would be:

[(1, Det, 4), (2, som, 4), (3, indetifierar, 0), (4, rasismen, 3), (5, är, 4), (6, den, 8), (7, främlingsfientliga, 8), (8, agendan, 9), (9, och, 9), (10, motståndet, 9), (11, till, 10), (12, invandring, 10)]

Also, note that deciding the right head for "och" can be ambiguous as coordinating conjunctions can be seen as dependent on either or both the constituents it connects in different frameworks.
