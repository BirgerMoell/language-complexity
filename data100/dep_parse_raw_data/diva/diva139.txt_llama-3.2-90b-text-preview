To analyze the given Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we'll first tokenize the sentence and then identify the grammatical relationships between the tokens.

The sentence is: "I den har jag endast tagit med totalsumman samt markeringen av de tre högsta talen."

Tokenized sentence:
1. I
2. den
3. har
4. jag
5. endast
6. tagit
7. med
8. totalsumman
9. samt
10. markeringen
11. av
12. de
13. tre
14. högsta
15. talen

Now, let's create the dependency tree. The analysis is as follows:

- The main clause of the sentence is "jag har tagit med" (I have taken with). 
  - "jag" (4) is the subject, depending on the main verb "har" (not a real verb in this context, the verb is actually "tagit").
  - "har" (3) is an auxiliary verb and a dependency of "tagit".
  - "tagit" (6) is the main verb of the sentence, head of the sentence.
- "I den" is an adverbial phrase describing the extent or location of the action.
  - "I" (1) is a preposition that depends on "den" (not directly on the main clause).
  - "den" (2) is the object of the preposition, and it has a relation with "tagit" (actually with the whole sentence), let's link it to the main verb.
- "endast" is an adverb that modifies "tagit" (only, used to provide contrasting emphasis).
  - "endast" (5) modifies the main verb, depending on "tagit".
- "med totalsumman" is a prepositional phrase indicating what is taken.
  - "med" (7) is a preposition that depends on "totalsumman".
  - "totalsumman" (8) is the object of the preposition, and it also has a relationship with the main verb "tagit".
  - Let's assume it is the object of "tagit", dependency of "tagit".
- The second part of the sentence is "samt markeringen av de tre högsta talen".
  - "samt" (9) is a coordinating conjunction that links "totalsumman" to the next part of the sentence.
  - "markeringen" is the subject of an implicit sentence ("samt markeringen"), related to "tagit".
  - "av" (11) is a preposition that depends on "markeringen".
  - "de" (12) is a determiner that depends on "tre högsta talen".
  - "tre" (13) is an adjective that depends on "högsta talen".
  - "högsta" (14) is an adjective that depends on "talen".
  - "talen" (15) is a noun that is the object of the preposition "av".

Based on the above analysis, the output of the dependency tree is:

[(1, I, 2), 
 (2, den, 6), 
 (3, har, 6), 
 (4, jag, 6), 
 (5, endast, 6), 
 (6, tagit, 0), 
 (7, med, 8), 
 (8, totalsumman, 6), 
 (9, samt, 8), 
 (10, markeringen, 6), 
 (11, av, 15), 
 (12, de, 14), 
 (13, tre, 14), 
 (14, högsta, 15), 
 (15, talen, 11)]

Note: Depending on the parser used, the output may vary.
