The dependency tree for the given Swedish sentence would be:

[(1, De, 2), (2, storlekar, 3), (3, som, 5), (4, finns, 5), (5, är, 0), (6, 15", 5), (7, ", 6), (8, 17", 9), (9, ", 8), (10, 19", 9), (11, ", 10), (12, och, 13), (13, 21", 9), (14, ", 13), (15, på, 9), (16, de, 18), (17, vanliga, 18), (18, skärmarna12", 15), (19, ", 18), (20, 15", 21), (21, ", 20), (22, 17", 23), (23, ", 22), (24, och, 25), (25, 18", 23), (26, ", 25), (27, på, 28), (28, de, 30), (29, platta, 30), (30, skärmarna, 28)]

Here's a breakdown of the sentence:

- "De storlekar" is the subject of the sentence, "storlekar" is the head and depends on the verb "är".
- "som finns" is a relative clause modifying "storlekar", "finns" is the head and depends on "är".
- "är" is the main verb and the root of the sentence.
- "15", 17", 19" och 21" are the objects of the sentence, and their heads are "är".
- "på de vanliga skärmarna" and "på de platta skärmarna" are prepositional phrases modifying "storlekar", with "på" as the head and depending on "är".

This is not a perfect analysis, as it relies on a simple set of rules, but it should provide a reasonable approximation of the dependency tree.
