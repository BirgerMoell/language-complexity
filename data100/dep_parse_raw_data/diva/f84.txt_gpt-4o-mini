To analyze the provided Swedish sentence and create a dependency tree, we'll break it down into tokens and identify their relationships. 

The sentence is: "Vi har dock blivit mer civiliserad och slåss inte lika mycket – men ändå för mycket."

Here's the dependency representation of the sentence:

1. **Tokens**:
   - "Vi" (We)
   - "har" (have)
   - "dock" (however)
   - "blivit" (become)
   - "mer" (more)
   - "civiliserad" (civilized)
   - "och" (and)
   - "slåss" (fight)
   - "inte" (not)
   - "lika" (as)
   - "mycket" (much)
   - "–" (dash)
   - "men" (but)
   - "ändå" (still)
   - "för" (too)
   - "mycket" (much)

2. **Dependency tree representation**:
- For the main verbs and their dependencies, I will link them to their heads.

Here is the dependency tree in the specified format:

```
[
    (1, Vi, 2),
    (2, har, 0),
    (3, dock, 2),
    (4, blivit, 2),
    (5, mer, 6),
    (6, civiliserad, 4),
    (7, och, 8),
    (8, slåss, 4),
    (9, inte, 8),
    (10, lika, 11),
    (11, mycket, 8),
    (12, –, 2),
    (13, men, 12),
    (14, ändå, 13),
    (15, för, 16),
    (16, mycket, 14)
]
```

In this output:
- The first number is the index of each token.
- The second entry is the token itself.
- The last number indicates the index of the head token, which connects them in the tree structure.
