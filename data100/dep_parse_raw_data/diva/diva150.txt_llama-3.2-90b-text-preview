I will assume that the input sentence is in Swedish, but the sentence you provided is actually in English. Since it's not a Swedish sentence, I'll work with it as an English sentence instead. Here's the dependency tree for the given sentence:

[(1, An, 2), (2, extensive, 3), (3, literature, 4), (4, study, 6), (5, has, 6), (6, been, 7), (7, made, 0), (8, to, 9), (9, evaluate, 7), (10, all, 11), (11, techniques, 9), (12, on, 9), (13, the, 14), (14, market, 12), (15, and, 17), (16, characterize, 17), (17, what, 18), (18, separates, 16), (19, the, 20), (20, different, 21), (21, processes, 16), (22, ., 0)]

Here's how to read this tree:

- The first element of each tuple is the token index.
- The second element is the token itself.
- The third element is the index of the head token. A head token of 0 indicates that the token is the root of the sentence.

In this sentence, the root is the verb "made". The words "An extensive literature study" are a nominal phrase, functioning as the object of the action "made". The verb "has" is an auxiliary to "made". The clause "to evaluate ... processes" is an infinitive phrase, functioning as an argument of the verb "made".
