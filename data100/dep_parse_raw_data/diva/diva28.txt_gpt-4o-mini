To analyze the given Swedish sentence and create a dependency tree, we first identify the tokens and their heads in the sentence structure. Here is the output in the requested format:

```
[
    (1, Arbetet, 2), 
    (2, är, 0), 
    (3, ämnat, 2), 
    (4, att, 3), 
    (5, kunna, 4), 
    (6, utgöra, 5), 
    (7, en, 8), 
    (8, plattform, 6), 
    (9, för, 10), 
    (10, en, 11), 
    (11, vidare, 12), 
    (12, diskussion, 9), 
    (13, kring, 12), 
    (14, vad, 15), 
    (15, som, 16), 
    (16, är, 18),
    (17, rimligt, 16), 
    (18, måttligt, 16), 
    (19, och, 16), 
    (20, möjligt, 16), 
    (21, att, 22), 
    (22, kräva, 20), 
    (23, ., 2)
]
```

In this output:
- Each token is indexed, with its word form and the index of its head.
- The root of the sentence (main verb) is indicated by a head index of 0.
- Punctuation (the full stop) is also included as its own token.
