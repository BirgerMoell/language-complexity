To create a dependency tree, we need to understand the grammatical relationships between the tokens in the sentence. Here is the analysis:

1. **Sandstormar**: The sentence starts with the noun "Sandstormar" (sandstorms) which is the subject of the sentence.
2. **och**: The conjunction "och" (and) is used to connect "Sandstormar" with the rest of the sentence.
3. **andra**: The adjective "andra" (other) is used to describe the noun "katastrofer" (catastrophes).
4. **katastrofer**: The noun "katastrofer" is the object of the sentence.
5. **väntar**: The verb "väntar" (await/wait) is the main verb of the sentence, linking the subject to the object.
6. **den**: The pronoun "den" is a possessive pronoun that introduces the noun "alltmer handlingskraftiga Kuki".
7. **alltmer**: The adverb "alltmer" (increasingly) is an adverb that modifies the adjective "handlingskraftiga".
8. **handlingskraftiga**: The adjective "handlingskraftiga" (increasingly active/resolute) is used to describe the noun "Kuki".
9. **Kuki**: The noun "Kuki" is the noun modified by the possessive pronoun "den" and the adjectives "alltmer" and "handlingskraftiga".
10. **,**: The comma is a punctuation mark that separates the main clause from the subordinate clause.
11. **som**: The pronoun "som" (as/which) is used to introduce the subordinate clause.
12. **växer**: The verb "växer" (grows) is the main verb of the subordinate clause.
13. **med**: The preposition "med" (with) is used to introduce the object of the subordinate clause.
14. **sin**: The possessive pronoun "sin" (his/her/its) is used to modify the noun "uppgift".
15. **uppgift**: The noun "uppgift" (task-duty) is the object of the preposition "med".
16. **för**: The preposition "för" (for) is used to introduce the time clause.
17. **var**: The pronoun "var" (every) is used to modify the noun "dag".
18. **dag**: The noun "dag" (day) is the object of the preposition "för".
19. **som**: The pronoun "som" (which/as) is used to introduce the relative clause.
20. **går**: The verb "går" (passes/goes) is the main verb of the relative clause.
21. **.**: The full stop is a punctuation mark that marks the end of the sentence.

Based on the analysis above, we can construct the following dependency tree:

[(1, Sandstormar, 5), (2, och, 4), (3, andra, 4), (4, katastrofer, 5), (5, väntar, 0), (6, den, 9), (7, alltmer, 8), (8, handlingskraftiga, 9), (9, Kuki, 5), (10, ',', 0), (11, som, 12), (12, växer, 9), (13, med, 15), (14, sin, 15), (15, uppgift, 12), (16, för, 18), (17, var, 18), (18, dag, 16), (19, som, 20), (20, går, 18), (21, '.', 0)]

Please note that this is a shallow dependency tree, where the goal is to identify the grammatical relationships between tokens, rather than a full parse tree.
