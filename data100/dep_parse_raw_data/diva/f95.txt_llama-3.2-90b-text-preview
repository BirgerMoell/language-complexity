To analyze the sentence, we will break it down into tokens and then determine their relationships.

The tokens of the sentence are:
1. Delarna
2. sätter
3. man
4. in
5. i
6. så
7. kallade
8. I/O-portar
9. (
10. In/Out-portar
11. )
12. ,
13. och
14. desto
15. fler
16. sådana
17. man
18. har
19. ,
20. desto
21. fler
22. grafikkort
23. och
24. ljudkort
25. m
26. .

Here is the analysis:
- "Delarna" is the subject of the sentence, but in this part of the sentence, it is the direct object of "sätter". So Delarna (1) is a child of sätter (2).
- "sätter" (2) is the main verb of the first clause, making it the head.
- "man" (3) is the subject of the first clause, making it a child of "sätter" (2).
- "in" (4) is a particle that goes with the verb "sätter", so it is also a child of "sätter" (2).
- "i" (5) is a preposition governing the object "så kallade I/O-portar".
- "så" (6) is an adverb modifying the adjective "kallade" (7).
- "kallade" (7) is an adjective modifying the noun "I/O-portar" (8).
- "I/O-portar" (8) is the object of the preposition "i" (5).
- The parenthetical remark "(In/Out-portar)" (10) is a definition of "I/O-portar" (8).
- The comma (12) and the closing parenthesis (11) separate items in the sentence and "och" (13) connects the clauses.
- "desto" (14) and "fler" (15) form an adverbial phrase that goes with "har" (18).
- "sådana" (16) is an adjective modifying the noun "man" (17), which is an object of "har" (18).
- The second "desto fler" (20, 21) is in the second clause, modifying the subject of the next verb.
- The items "grafikkort" (22), "och" (23), and "ljudkort" (24) are objects of the implied verb. Because the verb is missing, they will be assigned to "har" (18).
- The final "m" (25) and the period (26) indicate the end of the clause and sentence respectively.
