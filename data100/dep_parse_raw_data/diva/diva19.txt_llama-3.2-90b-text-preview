To create the dependency tree, I will analyze the sentence and break it down into its components. Note that the output is in the CoNLL-U format, but simplified to only include the token index, token, and head token index.

Here's the sentence broken down:

1. Vi
2. har
3. valt
4. att
5. geografiskt
6. avgränsa
7. oss
8. endast
9. till
10. Stockholms
11. innerstad
12. där
13. vi
14. även
15. har
16. jämfört
17. de
18. olika
19. delmarknaderna
20. Kungsholmen
21. ,
22. Södermalm
23. ,
24. Vasastan
25. ,
26. Östermalm
27. med
28. varandra
29. .

Now, let's analyze the sentence and create the dependency tree:

- "Vi" (1) is the subject of the sentence and the main clause "har valt att geografiskt avgränsa oss...". The head of "Vi" is the finite verb "har" (2).
  [(1, Vi, 2)]
- "har" (2) is the finite verb of the main clause and has the previously mentioned "vi" as its subject. It is also the main verb of the sentence, so its head is the root (0) of the tree.
  [(2, har, 0)]
- "valt" (3) is the participle verb phrase and the head is the finite verb "har" (2).
  [(3, valt, 2)]
- "att" (4) is the subordinating conjunction introducing the infinitive clause. Its head is the finite verb "valt" (3) which is part of the main clause.
  [(4, att, 3)]
- "geografiskt" (5) is the adverbial modifier of the verb "avgränsa" (6) and has it as its head.
  [(5, geografiskt, 6)]
- "avgränsa" (6) is the main verb of the infinitive clause. The head of "avgränsa" is the finite verb "valt" (3) in the main clause, as this main clause is describing what has been chosen (to be limited).
  [(6, avgränsa, 3)]
- "oss" (7) is an object pronoun and its head is the verb "avgränsa" (6).
  [(7, oss, 6)]
- "endast" (8) is an adverbial modifier that modifies the prepositional phrase with "till" (9). Its head is "till" (9).
  [(8, endast, 9)]
- "till" (9) is a preposition and its head is the verb "avgränsa" (6) because it is describing where avgränsa is being done (the location).
  [(9, till, 6)]
- "Stockholms" (10) is an adjective modifying "innerstad" (11) and has it as its head.
  [(10, Stockholms, 11)]
- "innerstad" (11) is the object of the preposition and its head is the preposition "till" (9).
  [(11, innerstad, 9)]
- "där" (12) is the conjunction used for introducing the adverbial clause (in which they compared markets) and its head is the main clause verb "valt" (3).
  [(12, där, 3)]
- "vi" (13) is the subject of the subordinate clause. The head of "vi" is the finite verb "har" (15).
  [(13, vi, 15)]
- "också" (14) (even) is translated to 'även', which in this case has a head of the finite verb "har" (15).
  [(14, även, 15)]
- "har" (15) is the finite verb of the main clause and has the previously mentioned "vi" as its subject. Its head is the root of the tree (0).
  [(15, har, 0)]
- "jämfört" (16) is the participle verb phrase and the head is the finite verb "har" (15).
  [(16, jämfört, 15)]
- "de" (17) is an adjective that modifies the noun "olika" (18) and has it as its head.
  [(17, de, 18)]
- "olika" (18) is an
