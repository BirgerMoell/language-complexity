To analyze the given sentence and produce a dependency tree, we can use the following breakdown:

- 'De' is a pronoun that serves as the subject of the sentence, so its head is the root of the sentence.
- 'sitter' is a verb and the main predicate of the sentence, so its head is the subject 'De'. However, since 'De' is not the root, we should use 0 to indicate the root of the sentence.
- 'fast' is an adverb modifying 'sitter', so the head of 'fast' is 'sitter'.
- 'där' is an adverb indicating the location of 'sitter', so the head of 'där' is also 'sitter'.
- 'för att' is a conjunction introducing the purpose clause, so the head of 'för' is the conjunction 'att'.
- 'att' is the conjunction that introduces the purpose clause and its head is the main verb 'sitter' of the sentence, however since 'att' introduces a new clause it's not 0 (root).
- 'snabbare' is an adverb modifying 'kunna', so the head of 'snabbare' is 'kunna'.
- 'kunna' is a verb in the purpose clause and is under the conjunction 'att', which in turn is under 'sitter'. Thus 'kunna' is the head of the purpose clause. So 'kunna' is under 'att', and since 'att' is under 'sitter', we will represent this relationship as (8, kunna, 2)
- 'hantera' is the main verb of the purpose clause and its head is 'kunna'.
- 'informationen' is the direct object of 'hantera' and its head is 'hantera'.
- 'som' is a conjunction that introduces the subordinate clause 'som kommer från...'.
- 'kommer' is the main verb of the subordinate clause and its head is 'som'.
- 'från' is a preposition and the head is the noun 'datorns olika delar'.
- 'datorns' is a possessive and its head is the noun 'olika delar'.
- 'olika' is an adjective and the head is 'delar'.
- 'delar' is the direct object of the preposition 'från', but since 'från' is under 'som' which is under 'informationen', the head is 'informationen' or we represent the relationship with (18, delar, 10).
- 'kort' is a noun and appears in a coordination ('och') and its head is the conjunction 'och'.
- 'och' is a conjunction of 'kort' and 'annan utrustning', the head is the main noun phrase ('informationen'), however since 'informationen' is not the head of the whole sentence we represent the relationship with (19, och, 10).
- 'annan' is an adjective and its head is 'utrustning'.
- 'utrustning' is a noun and its head is the same as 'kort' which is the conjunction 'och'.
- '.'(dot) is the punctuation of the sentence.

With these relationships we can represent the sentence with a tree using the following triples:

[(1, De, 0), (2, sitter, 0), (3, fast, 2), (4, där, 2), (5, för, 6), (6, att, 2), (7, snabbare, 8), (8, kunna, 2), (9, hantera, 8), (10, informationen, 9), (11, som, 10), (12, kommer, 11), (13, från, 15), (14, datorns, 15), (15, olika, 18), (16, delar, 18), (17, komma, 12), (18, delar, 10), (19, och, 10), (20, annan, 22), (21, kort, 19), (22, utrustning, 19), (23, ., 0)]

Note that we use '0' to represent the root of the sentence and we use the indexes after processing commas and punctuation as regular tokens.
