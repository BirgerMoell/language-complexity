Based on the provided Swedish sentence, I'll attempt to create a dependency tree. Please note that the accuracy of this analysis might not be perfect due to the limitations of automated parsing and the complexity of the Swedish language.

Here's the sentence with tokens and their indexes:

1. Delarna
2. sätter
3. man
4. in
5. i
6. så
7. kallade
8. I/O-portar
9. (In/Out-portar)
10. ),
11. och
12. desto
13. fler
14. sådana
15. man
16. har,
17. desto
18. fler
19. grafikkort
20. och
21. ljudkort
22. m.

Here's the dependency tree:

(1, Delarna, 2)
(2, sätter, 0)
(3, man, 2)
(4, in, 2)
(5, i, 8)
(6, så, 7)
(7, kallade, 8)
(8, I/O-portar, 2)
(9, (In/Out-portar, 8)
(10, ), 8)
(11, och, 0)
(12, desto, 13)
(13, fler, 14)
(14, sådana, 15)
(15, man, 16)
(16, har, 17)
(17, desto, 18)
(18, fler, 19)
(19, grafikkort, 20)
(20, och, 0)
(21, ljudkort, 20)
(22, m., 0)

This dependency tree suggests the following relationships:

* 'sätter' is the main verb, with 'Delarna' as its subject and 'in' as an adverbial modifier. 'man' is an indirect object of 'sätter'.
* 'I/O-portar' is a noun phrase, with 'så', 'kallade' as modifiers, and 'i' as a preposition. 'In/Out-portar' is a parenthetical remark.
* The parenthetical remark is closed with ')', which is a dependent of 'I/O-portar'.
* 'och' is a coordinating conjunction connecting two clauses.
* The second clause has 'desto fler sådana' as an adverbial phrase, with 'man har' as its dependent clause. 'desto fler' is a comparative phrase modifying 'sådana'.
* 'man' is the subject of 'har', an auxiliary verb dependent on 'sätter' through the conjunction 'och'.
* The final part of the sentence is another clause with 'desto fler' as an adverbial phrase and 'grafikkort' and 'ljudkort' as noun phrases connected with 'och'.
* 'm.' is an abbreviation with no clear dependent relationship; it's assumed to be dependent on the root. 

Please note that this analysis is not necessarily the only correct interpretation of the sentence, and there might be other valid parse trees.
