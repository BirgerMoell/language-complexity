To analyze the given Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, I'll provide a step-by-step breakdown. However, please note that Swedish sentence is not provided, but an English sentence is, so I will treat it as Swedish from a dependency parsing perspective.

 Tokenized sentence:
1. The
2. study
3. concludes
4. in
5. that
6. ‘a
7. sense
8. of
9. place’
10. as
11. defined
12. within
13. the
14. study,
15. is
16. highly
17. relevant
18. and
19. present
20. in
21. Swedish
22. municipal
23. planning
24. practice
25. .

 Dependency tree:
1. (1, The, 2)
2. (2, study, 3)
3. (3, concludes, 0)
4. (4, in, 5)
5. (5, that, 3)
6. (6, ‘a, 7)
7. (7, sense, 9)
8. (8, of, 7)
9. (9, place’, 5)
10. (10, as, 11)
11. (11, defined, 12)
12. (12, within, 13)

14. (14, study, 11)
15. (15, is, 16)
16. (15, is, 3)
   -> Although is seems to have two parents here, 'study' is the main clause and 'is' here functions more like a copula, 
      some treebanks may resolve it as an acl:relcl with no link with 'concludes' here or resolve ‘is’ function dependency by removing direct link with 'concludes' or using other means in such cases. Using a full complement, study: (15, is, 3) -> rephrased:  (15, is, 3)
16. (17), (replacing as no parent:): removing 16.
