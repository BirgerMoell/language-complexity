To analyze the provided Swedish sentence and create a dependency tree, we process it as follows:

1. Tokenize the sentence.
2. Determine the syntactic relationships between the tokens and their heads.

Here’s the dependency tree for the given sentence:

```
[
    (1, Det, 7),
    (2, som, 1),
    (3, förvånar, 2),
    (4, mig, 3),
    (5, mest, 3),
    (6, är, 7),
    (7, hur, 6),
    (8, föräldrarna, 9),
    (9, kan, 7),
    (10, låta, 9),
    (11, detta, 10),
    (12, ske, 10),
    (13, eftersom, 9),
    (14, i, 15),
    (15, nästan, 16),
    (16, alla, 14),
    (17, föräldrar, 16),
    (18, finns, 17),
    (19, det, 18),
    (20, en, 21),
    (21, instinkt, 20),
    (22, att, 21),
    (23, skydda, 22),
    (24, sin, 25),
    (25, barn, 24),
    (26, från, 27),
    (27, allt, 26),
    (28, ont, 27),
    (29, och, 30),
    (30, ingen, 31),
    (31, vill, 30),
    (32, väl, 31),
    (33, se, 31),
    (34, sitt, 35),
    (35, eget, 34),
    (36, barn, 35),
    (37, lida, 36)
]
```

In this representation:
- Each tuple consists of the index of the token, the token itself, and the index of the token's head.
- The root of the sentence is typically denoted by a second element of `0`, indicating no head, but here the main clause is complex. The main verb "är" heads several clauses.
- Punctuation (if any) would also be included as tokens.

This structure captures the syntactic relationships present in the original Swedish sentence.
