To analyze the given sentence and produce a dependency tree, I will use the following steps:

1.  **Tokenize the sentence**: Break the sentence into individual tokens, including punctuation marks.
2.  **Identify parts of speech**: Determine the part of speech (noun, verb, adjective, etc.) for each token.
3.  **Analyze dependencies**: Examine the grammatical relationships between tokens to determine the head of each phrase.

Here is the tokenized sentence with the corresponding parts of speech:

1.  För (adverb)
2.  att (subordinating conjunction)
3.  skapa (verb)
4.  struktur (noun)
5.  delas (verb)
6.  projektet (noun)
7.  in (preposition)
8.  i (preposition)
9.  fem (adjective)
10.  faser (noun)
11.  : (punctuation)
12.  Analys (noun)
13.  av (preposition)
14.  Elmo (proper noun)
15.  , (punctuation)
16.  planering (noun)
17.  , (punctuation)
18.  konceptutveckling (noun)
19.  , (punctuation)
20.  detaljkonstruktion (noun)
21.  och (conjunction)
22.  slutligen (adverb)
23.  produktutveckling (noun)
24.  och (conjunction)
25.  testning (noun)
26.  . (punctuation)

Now, let's analyze the dependencies:

*   The sentence starts with the adverb "För" (1), which is subordinating the following phrase.
*   The adverb "För" (1) and the subordinating conjunction "att" (2) form a subordinating phrase, with "att" (2) as the head.
*   The verb "skapa" (3) is the main action of the sentence and serves as the head of the verb phrase.
*   The adverb "För att" (1-2) is subordinating the verb phrase, with "skapa" (3) as the head.
*   The noun "struktur" (4) is the direct object of the verb "skapa" (3), with "skapa" (3) as the head.
*   The verb "delas" (5) is the main action of the next clause and serves as the head of the verb phrase.
*   The noun "projektet" (6) is the subject of the sentence, with "delas" (5) as the head.
*   The preposition "in i" (7-8) forms a prepositional phrase, with "i" (8) as the head.
*   The adjective "fem" (9) is modifying the noun "faser" (10), with "faser" (10) as the head.
*   The noun "faser" (10) is the object of the preposition "i" (8), with "i" (8) as the head.
*   The verb "delas" (5) is the main action of the sentence and serves as the head of the clause.
*   The punctuation mark ":" (11) is ending the first part of the sentence and serving as a separator.
*   The noun "Analys" (12) is the first item in the list, with the overall head being "projektet" (6).
*   The preposition "av" (13) forms a prepositional phrase, with "Elmo" (14) as the object and "av" (13) as the head.
*   The proper noun "Elmo" (14) is the object of the preposition "av" (13), with "av" (13) as the head.
*   The comma "," (15) is separating the items in the list.
*   The remaining nouns "planering" (16), "konceptutveckling" (18), "detaljkonstruktion" (20), "produktutveckling" (23) and "testning" (25) form the rest of the list with "projektet" (6) as the overall head.

The dependency tree is as follows:

[(1, För, 2), 
(2, att, 3), 
(3, skapa, 0), 
(4, struktur, 3), 
(5, delas, 0), 
(6, projektet, 5), 
(7, in, 8), 
(8, i, 10), 
(9, fem, 10), 
(10, faser, 8), 
(11, :, 12), 
(12, Analys
