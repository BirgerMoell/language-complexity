After analyzing the Swedish sentence, I've created the following dependency tree:

[(1, Medlemmar, 2), (2, :, 2), (3, Det, 5), (4, fanns, 5), (5, fanns, 0), 
(6, 172, 7), (7, medlemmar, 4), (8, i, 7), (9, Jönköping, 8), (10, vid, 4), 
(11, årsskiftet, 10), (12, och, 4), (13, i, 16), (14, hela, 15), (15, Sverige, 13), 
(16, cirka, 16), (17, 2500, 12), (18, ., 5)]

In this output, each triple represents a token, its lemma, and its head token in the dependency tree.

Here's a brief explanation of the analysis:

* "Medlemmar:" is a special case, where the colon is attached to the preceding word as a separate token. "Medlemmar" is a subject, but in this context, it functions as an appositive, providing a heading or definition for the subsequent sentence. Therefore, it is not a direct part of the sentence's dependency structure and is attached to the colon with index 2, which has no head in this sentence.
* The sentence begins with the pronoun "Det", which is a subject of the sentence and attaches to the main predicate "fanns".
* "Fanns" is the main verb, with several dependents:
  * "172 medlemmar" is a direct object of "fanns", with "172" as a determiner of "medlemmar" and "medlemmar" attaching to "fanns".
  * "i Jönköping" is a prepositional phrase modifying "medlemmar", where "i" attaches to "medlemmar".
  * "vid årsskiftet" is another prepositional phrase modifying "fanns", where "vid" attaches to "fanns".
* The sentence also includes a coordinate clause "och ... Sverige cirka 2500", which attaches to the main predicate "fanns" through the conjunction "och".
* The second clause has its own dependency structure:
  * "i hela Sverige" is a prepositional phrase modifying the nominal phrase "cirka 2500".
  * "cirka 2500" is the direct object of the clause, attaching to the implicit main verb, which is related to "fanns".

Note that this analysis is based on standard dependency parsing techniques and may not be perfect for this sentence due to its complex structure and special cases.
