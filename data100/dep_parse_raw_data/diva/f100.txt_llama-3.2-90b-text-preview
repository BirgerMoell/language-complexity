The given Swedish sentence is: "Sedan försökte jag sammanställa det till en relativt kort text."

Here's a dependency tree representation of the sentence:

[(1, Sedan, 2), (2, försökte, 0), (3, jag, 2), (4, sammanställa, 2), (5, det, 6), (6, till, 4), (7, en, 8), (8, relativt, 9), (9, kort, 10), (10, text, 4), (11, ., 2)]

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how this tree is constructed:

* "Sedan" is a subordinating adverb that depends on the main verb "försökte." (1, Sedan, 2)
* "Försökte" is the main verb, so its head is 0 (the root of the sentence). (2, försökte, 0)
* "Jag" is the subject of the main clause, so it depends on the main verb. (3, jag, 2)
* "Sammanställa" is an object of the main verb, so it also depends on "försökte." (4, sammanställa, 2)
* "Det" is an object of the preposition "till," so it depends on "till." (5, det, 6)
* "Till" is a preposition that depends on the verb "sammanställa," since it describes the target of the action. (6, till, 4)
* "En" is a determiner that depends on the adjective "relativt," which in turn depends on the noun "kort" (which is not exactly correct but we simplify here and link to word 'kort'). (7, en, 8)
* "Relativt" is an adjective that modifies the noun "kort." (8, relativt, 9)
* "Kort" is an adjective that modifies the noun "text." (9, kort, 10)
* "Text" is the object of the preposition "till" and, through that, of the main verb, so it depends on "sammanställa." (10, text, 4)
* The full stop is a punctuation mark that depends on the main sentence, so its head is the main verb. (11, ., 2)
