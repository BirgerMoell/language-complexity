To analyze the provided English sentence and produce a dependency tree, we first break down the sentence into its tokens and determine their syntactic relationships. Here is the output based on that analysis:

[(1, If, 2), (2, the, 3), (3, actual, 4), (4, energy, 5), (5, consumption, 6), (6, is, 8), (7, significantly, 6), (8, below, 9), (9, the, 10), (10, reference, 11), (11, value, 6), (12, ,, 6), (13, we, 14), (14, believe, 0), (15, that, 16), (16, a, 17), (17, major, 18), (18, ,, 17), (19, costly, 18), (20, investigation, 14), (21, is, 20), (22, not, 21), (23, necessary, 21), (24, ., 0)]

This representation reflects the dependencies and relationships among the tokens in the sentence. Note that punctuation marks have been included as tokens.
