To analyze the given Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we'll first identify the parts of speech for each token. Then we'll create the dependency relationships between them.

Here's the analysis:

1. Man (PRON)
2. startar (VERB)
3. oftast (ADV)
4. FTP (PROPN)
5. genom (ADP)
6. att (PART)
7. liksom (SCONJ)
8. med (ADP)
9. TELNET (PROPN)
10. skriva (VERB)
11. FTP (PROPN)
12. och (CONJ)
13. sen (ADV)
14. domännamnet (NOUN)
15. på (ADP)
16. en (DET) (implied, not present in this sentence, but "dn" is a common abbreviation for "den")
17. dn (DET) (common abbreviation for "den" in informal texting, but grammatically incorrect in formal Swedish; treated as a replacement for "den" here)
18. dator (NOUN)
19. som (PRON)
20. du (PRON)
21. vill (VERB)
22. koppla (VERB)
23. upp (ADP)
24. dig (PRON)
25. till (ADP)
26. . (PUNCT)

Now, let's create the dependency tree:

[(1, Man, 2), 
 (2, startar, 0), 
 (3, oftast, 2), 
 (4, FTP, 2), 
 (5, genom, 4), 
 (6, att, 7), 
 (7, liksom, 5), 
 (8, med, 9), 
 (9, TELNET, 7), 
 (10, skriva, 7), 
 (11, FTP, 10), 
 (12, och, 13), 
 (13, sen, 14), 
 (14, domännamnet, 16), 
 (16, dn, 18), 
 (17, Note: dn should ideally be treated as a part of 16; however for the formal analysis we're providing, the indices remain as it is and can be treated as an incorrect entry and instead dn dator  -> dator with dn being expansion to "den" to be taken as intended meaning)
 (18, dator, 14), 
 (19, som, 20), 
 (20, du, 21), 
 (21, vill, 22), 
 (22, koppla, 2), 
 (23, upp, 24), 
 (24, dig, 22), 
 (25, till, 22), 
 (26, ., 2)]

Here's the dependency tree in the specified format. Note that we assume a missing determinant before "dn" and allow our understanding that (17, dn) be meant as expansion "den"/ modification that could be for understanding only
