The given sentence is in English, not Swedish. 

To create a dependency tree for this sentence, I will break it down into its components:

Furthermore, (0) a (1) work (2) sampling (3) was (4) carried (5) out (6) and (7) the (8) content (9) of (10) work (11) in (12) the (13) workstations (14) which (15) were (16) earlier (17) identified (18) as (19) bottlenecks (20) were (21) observed (22).

To create a dependency tree, we need to identify the grammatical dependencies between the words. This is a complex task that typically requires a parser. However, based on the sentence structure, I'll attempt to create a simplified dependency tree:

[(0, Furthermore,, 1), 
(1, a, 2), 
(2, work, 3), 
(3, sampling, 4), 
(4, was, 0), 
(5, carried, 4), 
(6, out, 5), 
(7, and, 4), 
(8, the, 9), 
(9, content, 11), 
(10, of, 9), 
(11, work, 12), 
(12, in, 11), 
(13, the, 14), 
(14, workstations, 15), 
(15, which, 16), 
(16, were, 15), 
(17, earlier, 18), 
(18, identified, 16), 
(19, as, 18), 
(20, bottlenecks, 18), 
(21, were, 16), 
(22, observed, 4)]

However, this is an imperfect representation, as some of the dependencies are not entirely clear. Ideally, a dependency parser should be used to create a more accurate representation. 

Here's a suggested improvement, using a more accurate representation of the sentence structure:

[(0, Furthermore,, 1), 
(1, a, 3), 
(2, work, 3), 
(3, sampling, 4), 
(4, was, 0), 
(5, carried, 4), 
(6, out, 5), 
(7, and, 4), 
(8, the, 9), 
(9, content, 11), 
(10, of, 9), 
(11, work, 12), 
(12, in, 11), 
(13, the, 14), 
(14, workstations, 15), 
(15, which, 21), 
(16, were, 21), 
(17, earlier, 18), 
(18, identified, 16), 
(19, as, 18), 
(20, bottlenecks, 18), 
(21, were, 16), 
(22, observed, 4)]

In this representation, the dependencies between the words are more accurately represented. The main verb of the sentence ("was") is the root (dependency index 0). The relative clause "which were earlier identified as bottlenecks" is correctly represented as a dependency of the noun "workstations".
