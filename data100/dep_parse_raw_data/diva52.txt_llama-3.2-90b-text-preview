The given Swedish sentence is:

"Den modell som har skapats har visat sig producera mycket bra resultat och de slutsatser som kan dras av detta arbete är att vattenkraften har mycket goda möjligheter att balansera den ojämna vindkraftsproduktionen."

Dependency tree:

Note: The word order in Swedish can be more flexible than in English. However, for a more interpretable and straightforward dependency tree, the auxiliary verb "har" has been linked as an auxiliary component of the main verb of the clause ("skapats" and "producera" respectively), and "sig" has been linked as a reflexive pronoun to its associated verb ("visat"). The word "att" has been treated as an infinitive marker.

This dependency tree is a representation of a sentence structure as a directed tree where nodes represent tokens from the sentence and edges represent relations between them. However, English dependency parsing algorithms and Swedish dependency parsing algorithms may assign these relations slightly differently.
