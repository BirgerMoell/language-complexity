To analyze the given Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we need to parse the sentence into its constituent parts. Since the provided sentence is in English rather than Swedish, I'll proceed with the analysis.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. Tokenize the sentence:
   - Rising
   - costs
   - of
   - energy
   - ,
   - combined
   - with
   - an
   - increasing
   - environmental
   - consciousness
   - on
   - the
   - part
   - of
   - building
   - owners
   - ,
   - render
   - timely
   - the
   - law
   - on
   - certification
   - of
   - buildings
   - for
   - energy
   - efficiency
   - .

2. Identify the relationships between tokens:
   - The main verb is 'render'.
   - 'Rising costs of energy' and 'combined with an increasing environmental consciousness on the part of building owners' are two separate phrases that modify the main verb 'render'.
   - 'Rising costs of energy' is a noun phrase where 'energy' is the main noun, 'costs' is an adjective, and 'Rising' is an adverb modifying 'costs', and 'of' is a preposition connecting 'costs' and 'energy'.
   - 'Combined with an increasing environmental consciousness on the part of building owners' is a prepositional phrase modifying the main verb 'render', with 'combined with' as the preposition, 'an increasing environmental consciousness' as the main noun phrase, and 'on the part of building owners' as another prepositional phrase.
   - 'an increasing environmental consciousness' is a noun phrase with 'consciousness' as the main noun, 'environmental' as an adjective, 'increasing' as an adverb modifying 'consciousness', and 'an' as an article.
   - 'on the part of building owners' is a prepositional phrase with 'on' as the preposition, 'the part' as a noun phrase with 'part' as the main noun, and 'of building owners' as another prepositional phrase modifying 'part'.
   - 'of building owners' is a prepositional phrase with 'of' as the preposition, 'building owners' as the main noun phrase, 'building' as an adjective, 'owners' as the main noun.
   - 'timely' is an adjective modifying the main verb 'render'.
   - 'the law on certification of buildings for energy efficiency' is a noun phrase with 'law' as the main noun, 'on certification of buildings for energy efficiency' as a prepositional phrase modifying 'law'.
   - 'on certification of buildings for energy efficiency' is a prepositional phrase with 'on' as the preposition, 'certification of buildings for energy efficiency' as the main noun phrase.
   - 'certification of buildings for energy efficiency' is a noun phrase with 'certification' as the main noun, 'of buildings' as a prepositional phrase modifying 'certification', 'for energy efficiency' as another prepositional phrase modifying 'certification'.
   - 'of buildings' is a prepositional phrase with 'of' as the preposition, 'buildings' as the main noun.
   - 'for energy efficiency' is a prepositional phrase with 'for' as the preposition, 'energy efficiency' as the main noun phrase with 'energy' as an adjective, 'efficiency' as the main noun.
