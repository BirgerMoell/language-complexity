To analyze the provided Swedish sentence, we will identify the dependencies and the relationships between the words, creating a dependency tree. Here’s the output for your sentence:

```

 (3, färgglada, 2), 
 (4, och, 2), 
 (5, får, 2),

 (7, fotosyntes, 6), 
 (8, ca, 9), 
 (9, 90, 10), 
 (10, %, 5), 
 (11, energi, 10), 
 (12, ,, 5), 
 (13, tack, 15),

 (21, inne, 20), 
 (22, i, 21), 
 (23, varje, 24),

 (25, ., 2)]
```

Here’s a breakdown of the structure:

1. "Polyperna" is the subject of the main predicate "blir."
2. "blir" serves as the root of the sentence.
3. "färgglada" describes the subject, connected to "blir."
4. "och" connects "blir" to "får," which shares the same subject.
5. "genom" introduces the prepositional phrase modifying "får."
6. "fotosyntes" is the object of the preposition "genom."
7. "ca" introduces an approximation for the measurements that follow.
8. "90" and "%" are numeric expressions for "energi."
9. The comma following "energi" and the conjunctions serve to connect clauses.
10. "tack vare" introduces a reason connected to "den grönalg," which is defined by "som."
11. "finns" acts as a verb in the relative clause, with "inne" specifying the location relative to "varje polyp."
