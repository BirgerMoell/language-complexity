Based on the provided Swedish sentence, I will analyze it and produce a dependency tree. Here is the breakdown:

1. Stockholm, (LOC, comma) - comma is a punctuation mark indicating the end of a locative phrase
2. oktober (NOUN) - is a noun indicating a month
3. år (NOUN) - is a noun indicating year, modifying the preceding year
4. 2009 (NUM) - is a number indicating the year
5. Elina Wetterblad (PROPN) - is a proper noun indicating the author's name
6. ii (X) - is an index or number in a sequence, Roman numeral for 'two'
7. iii (X) - is an index or number in a sequence, Roman numeral for 'three'
8. Sammanfattning (NOUN) - is a noun indicating summary
9. Under (ADP) - is a preposition 'under' in English, indicating the time frame
10. tidigare (ADJ) - is an adjective 'previously'
11. delen (NOUN) - is a noun 'part', the object of the preposition
12. av (ADP) - is a preposition 'of', part of the PP
13. 1960-talet (NOUN) - is a noun 'sixties', indicating the time period
14. var (VERB) - is the main verb 'was'

16. akut (ADJ) - is an adjective 'acute', describing the following noun
17. bostadskris (NOUN) - is a compound noun 'bostadskris' (housing crisis), the subject of the sentence
18. i (ADP) - is a preposition 'in' in English
19. Sverige (PROPN) - is a proper noun 'Sweden', indicating the location of the crisis

Here is the dependency tree representation using the required format:

[(1, Stockholm, 8), 
 (2, oktober, 4), 
 (3, år, 4), 
 (4, 2009, 3), 
 (5, Elina Wetterblad, 8), 
 (6, ii, 8), 
 (7, iii, 8), 
 (8, Sammanfattning, 0), 
 (9, Under, 11), 
 (10, tidigare, 11), 
 (11, delen, 14), 
 (12, av, 13), 
 (13, 1960-talet, 11), 
 (14, var, 0), 
 (15, det, 17), 
 (16, akut, 17), 
 (17, bostadskris, 14), 
 (18, i, 19), 
 (19, Sverige, 18)]

Note that some heads could be open to interpretation, especially for the first 8 tokens that don't form a syntactic clause but more of an introductory phrase. Here I have assumed that 'Sammanfattning' is the head of the first sentence "Stockholm, oktober år 2009 Elina Wetterblad ii iii Sammanfattning."
