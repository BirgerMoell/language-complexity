To analyze the given Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, I will break it down into individual tokens and identify their dependencies. The sentence is:

"I Chicago lyftes soloimprovisationen fram tillskillnad från tidigare då solot hade mindre betydelse."

Here's the tokenized sentence with token indices:

1. I
2. Chicago
3. lyftes
4. soloimprovisationen
5. fram
6. tillskillnad
7. från
8. tidigare
9. då
10. solot
11. hade
12. mindre
13. betydelse

After analyzing the sentence, I've identified the following dependencies:

- 'I' (1) is a prepositional object (i.e., it's the location where the action takes place) and its head is 'lyftes' (3), which is the main verb in the sentence.
- 'Chicago' (2) is a modifier of 'I' (1), providing more information about the location.
- 'lyftes' (3) is the main verb and the root of the sentence (i.e., its head is the sentence itself, which has an index of 0).
- 'soloimprovisationen' (4) is the direct object of 'lyftes' (3), the thing being lifted or highlighted.
- 'fram' (5) is an adverbial modifier of 'lyftes' (3), indicating the direction or manner of the action.
- 'tillskillnad' (6) is a prepositional phrase indicating a comparison or contrast, and its head is 'från' (7).
- 'från' (7) is a preposition and its head is 'tidigare' (8).
- 'tidigare' (8) is a prepositional object and its head is 'från' (7).
- 'då' (9) is a subordinating conjunction introducing a dependent clause and its head is 'hade' (11).
- 'solot' (10) is the subject of the dependent clause and its head is 'hade' (11).
- 'hade' (11) is the main verb of the dependent clause and its head is 'då' (9) in a larger sense, but more directly it's a 'had' in a 'had had' relationship where 'lyftes' is the 'had'.
- 'mindre' (12) is a modifier of 'betydelse' (13), indicating the degree or extent of the significance.
- 'betydelse' (13) is the direct object of 'hade' (11).

Here is the resulting dependency tree in the specified format:

[(1, I, 3), (2, Chicago, 1), (3, lyftes, 0), (4, soloimprovisationen, 3), 
(5, fram, 3), (6, tillskillnad, 7), (7, från, 3), (8, tidigare, 7), 
(9, då, 3), (10, solot, 11), (11, hade, 9), (12, mindre, 13), (13, betydelse, 11)]
