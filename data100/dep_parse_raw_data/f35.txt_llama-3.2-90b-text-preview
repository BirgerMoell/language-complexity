To create a dependency tree for the given Swedish sentence, we need to break down the sentence into its individual components and determine their relationships. Here is the given sentence with its tokens indexed:


1. Delarna
2. sätter
3. man
4. in
5. i
6. så
7. kallade
8. I/O-portar
9. (
10. In/Out-portar
11. )
12. ,
13. och
14. desto
15. fler
16. sådana
17. man
18. har
19. ,
20. desto
21. fler
22. grafikkort
23. och
24. ljudkort
25. m.

Now, let's determine the head of each token and create the dependency tree:

* Delarna is the subject of the sentence, so it depends on the main verb sätter.
* sätter is the main verb of the sentence, so it is the root of the tree.
* man is an object of the verb sätter.
* in is a preposition taking the phrase "i så kallade I/O-portar" as its object, and since it's used in a phrasal verb "sätter in", it takes the main verb sätter as head.
* i is a preposition in the phrase "i så kallade I/O-portar".
* så is an adverb modifying the adjective kallade.
* kallade is an adjective describing I/O-portar.
* I/O-portar is a noun being described by the phrase "så kallade I/O-portar", which in turn takes "in" as head, which head is "sätter".
* (In/Out-portar) is an apposition to I/O-portar and takes I/O-portar as head, and given structural context and lack of other edges to (, it makes a passable assumption that it also has its own edge to ( as ( does.
* , acts as punctuation bound to the conj("och", 2) which heads " the list [13] of [the 22] and [24]. Though more advanced evaluation could make an argument ( that this edge heads "2" the main verb, due to part of section becoming separated here. )
* och is a coordinating conjunction introducing the clause "desto fler sådana man har, desto fler grafikkort och ljudkort m.", which in turn takes sätter as head.
* desto is an adverb modifying "fler".
* fler is an adjective in the comparative form "desto fler" describing "sådana" and "grafikkort"  in a sentence structure but also in  parallel cojoined phrase.
* sådana is a noun being described in the first comparative part of the sentence.
* man is a subject of the clause "desto fler sådana man har" and takes "har" as head.
* har is a verb in the clause "desto fler sådana man har" and takes sätter as head in the sentence, due to influence from the rest of the context.
* , is a punctuation mark, which in this case should have the same head as in the part of the sentence before the parentheses as edge does not overlap index 18 should have a (11). However because that evaluates as punctuation and to keep clear structural format from the comparative edge does the sentence  correctly separate.
* desto is an adverb modifying "fler" and similar relationship described above.
* fler is an adjective in the second comparative part of the sentence describing "grafikkort" and a comparative phrase linking both "sådana man har", "grafikkort" since cojunction from conj("och", 23) lists both Grafik "och", "ljud" of previous comparative in logical flow.
* grafikkort is a noun in this context and is part of the list "grafikkort och ljudkort m." and takes the "och" coordinating conjunction as head which leads to main head "the main verb".
* och is a coordinating conjunction in the list "grafikkort och ljudkort m." and should essentially be noted it includes the Ljud in parallel of grafik listing which would just match the first comparative given.
* ljudkort is a noun in this context being coordinated to grafikkort and with parallel list inclusion take conj(24) head och.
* m. acts as a punctuation mark and attached with period, an ending mark, giving relationship to root, in dependency as '2'.
  
Here is the resulting dependency tree:


[(1, Delarna, 2), 
(2, sätter, 0), 
(3, man, 2), 
(4, in, 2), 
(5, i, 4), 
(6, så,
