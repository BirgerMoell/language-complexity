To analyze the Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we need to break down the sentence into individual tokens and then define the grammatical dependencies between these tokens.

Here's the tokenized sentence:

1. Exporten
2. ökade
3. och
4. vid
5. sekelskiftet
6. 1900
7. var
8. Sverige
9. den
10. ledande
11. exportören
12. i
13. hela
14. världen
15. .

Now let's analyze the grammatical dependencies between these tokens:

- Exporten (1) is the subject of the sentence, and ökade (2) is the main verb. Therefore, Exporten (1) depends on ökade (2).
- och (3) is a coordinating conjunction, coordinating the two clauses of the sentence. Therefore, och (3) depends on ökade (2) and the second clause.
- vid (4) is a preposition introducing the time phrase sekelskiftet 1900. Therefore, vid (4) depends on the main verb of the clause, which is var (7).
- sekelskiftet (5) is an object of the preposition vid, and 1900 is a postmodifier of sekelskiftet. Therefore, sekelskiftet (5) and 1900 (6) both depend on vid (4).
- var (7) is the main verb of the second clause, and Sverige (8) is the subject of the second clause. Therefore, Sverige (8) depends on var (7).
- den (9) is a determiner modifying the adjective ledande (10), which in turn modifies exportören (11). Therefore, den (9) and ledande (10) depend on exportören (11).
- i (12) is a preposition introducing the phrase hela världen. Therefore, i (12) depends on the main verb of the clause, which is var (7).
- hela (13) is an adjective modifying världen (14). Therefore, hela (13) depends on världen (14).
- . (15) is the punctuation mark at the end of the sentence. Therefore, it depends on the main verb of the sentence, which is ökade (2).

The resulting dependency tree is:

[(1, Exporten, 2), 
(2, ökade, 0), 
(3, och, 2), 
(4, vid, 7), 
(5, sekelskiftet, 4), 
(6, 1900, 4), 
(7, var, 2), 
(8, Sverige, 7), 
(9, den, 11), 
(10, ledande, 11), 
(11, exportören, 7), 
(12, i, 7), 
(13, hela, 14), 
(14, världen, 12), 
(15, ., 2)]

This dependency tree represents the grammatical dependencies between the tokens in the sentence. Note that the representation of the tree and the labels used to describe the dependencies can be system-dependent.
