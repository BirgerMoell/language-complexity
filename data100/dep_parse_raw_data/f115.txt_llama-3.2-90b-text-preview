To analyze the given Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we need to break it down into its individual tokens and then identify the grammatical relationships between them. Here is the sentence broken down into tokens:

1. Besöker
2. du
3. en
4. sida
5. om
6. till
7. exempel
8. antivirus
9. program
10. kan
11. det
12. hända
13. att
14. det
15. kommer
16. upp
17. ett
18. litet
19. fönster
20. som
21. tipsar
22. om
23. andra
24. antivirus
25. program
26. .

The resulting dependency tree is as follows:

[(1, Besöker, 0), (2, du, 1), (3, en, 4), (4, sida, 1), (5, om, 8), (6, till, 7), (7, exempel, 8), (8, antivirus, 9), (9, program, 5), (10, kan, 11), (11, det, 12), (12, hända, 10), (13, att, 14), (14, det, 15), (15, kommer, 12), (16, upp, 15), (17, ett, 19), (18, litet, 19), (19, fönster, 15), (20, som, 21), (21, tipsar, 19), (22, om, 24), (23, andra, 24), (24, antivirus, 25), (25, program, 22), (26, ., 0)]

Here, token 0 does not exist; instead, we represent the root of the tree with the index 0. The root of the tree is assumed to be a special NULL token, which is not explicitly included in the output.

In this analysis:

- The main clause "Besöker du en sida..." has "Besöker" as the head, with "du" as its subject and "en sida" as its object.
- The phrase "om till exempel antivirus program" is a prepositional phrase modifying the noun "sida", with "om" as its head.
- The clause "kan det hända..." is a dependent clause expressing possibility, with "kan" as its head.
- The clause "att det kommer..." is a dependent clause expressing the consequence, with "att" as its head and "det kommer upp ett litet fönster" as its main clause.
- The phrase "ett litet fönster" is the object of the clause "att det kommer..."; it has "ett litet" as its modifiers and "fönster" as its head.
- The clause "som tipsar om andra antivirus program" is a dependent clause describing the action performed by the window "fönster", with "som" as its head.
