To create a dependency tree for the provided Swedish sentence, we will analyze the syntactic structure and dependencies among the words. Here's the output based on the analysis:

```plaintext
[
    (1, Med, 2), 
    (2, dom, 3), 
    (3, bussarna, 4), 
    (4, åkte, 0), 
    (5, dom, 4), 
    (6, runt, 4), 
    (7, och, 4), 
    (8, hämtade, 4), 
    (9, upp, 8), 
    (10, skandinaviska, 11), 
    (11, judar/personer, 8), 
    (12, som, 11), 
    (13, satt, 12), 
    (14, i, 15), 
    (15, koncentrastionslägrerna, 13), 
    (16, som, 4), 
    (17, jag, 18), 
    (18, kommer, 16), 
    (19, berätta, 18), 
    (20, mer, 19), 
    (21, om, 20), 
    (22, lite, 23), 
    (23, senare, 21)
]
```

In this output, each tuple represents a word in the sentence, where their dependencies are marked by the head token's index. The root of the sentence is the verb "åkte" with an index of 0.
