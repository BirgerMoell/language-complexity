To analyze the given Swedish sentence and produce the dependency tree, we break down the sentence into tokens and identify their relations. Here’s the output for the provided sentence:

```
[(1, Är, 2), 
 (2, vätskan, 3), 
 (3, varm, 0), 
 (4, späd, 5), 
 (5, lite, 4), 
 (6, i, 9), 
 (7, sänder, 6), 
 (8, under, 9), 
 (9, omrörning, 0), 
 (10, och, 11), 
 (11, låt, 12), 
 (12, redningen, 11), 
 (13, koka, 12), 
 (14, upp, 13), 
 (15, mellan, 18), 
 (16, varje, 17), 
 (17, spädning, 15), 
 (18, ., 0)]
```

Each triple provides the index of the token, the token itself, and the index of its head token. The head token connects the dependent token in the syntactic structure of the sentence.
