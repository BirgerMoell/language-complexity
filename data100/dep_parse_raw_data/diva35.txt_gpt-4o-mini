To create a dependency tree for the given sentence, we will break it down into its tokens and establish the relationships between these tokens. 

Hereâ€™s the analysis and the resulting dependency tree:

1. The task in this thesis is to seek alternative applied methods that can enhance the existing methodologies that are used by SPICA and ARISTO, to make the power system more efficient and reliable.

The dependency tree output is as follows:

```
[
    (1, The, 2),
    (2, task, 6),
    (3, in, 2),
    (4, this, 5),
    (5, thesis, 2),
    (6, is, 0),
    (7, to, 6),
    (8, seek, 7),
    (9, alternative, 10),
    (10, applied, 11),
    (11, methods, 8),

    (13, can, 12),
    (14, enhance, 13),

In this representation:
- Each tuple represents a token with its index, the token itself, and the index of its head token.
- The head tokens are determined based on the grammatical structure of the sentence. 
- Punctuation (like the comma and period) is included as its own token and is associated with the appropriate head.
