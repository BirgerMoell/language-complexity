To produce the dependency tree for the given sentence, we will analyze the grammatical structure of the sentence.

The sentence is:
Dessa har dubbel takhöjd och är öppna mot de övre planen vilket skapar siktlinjer genom hela byggnaden.

This sentence can be broken down as follows:

- "Dessa" is the subject of the sentence, referring to something unspecified that has double the height and is open to the upper floors.
- "har" is the verb "to have" in the present tense, indicating that the subject possesses something.
- "dubbel takhöjd" is a phrase describing the height of the subject. "dubbel" is an adjective describing the noun "takhöjd".
- "och" is a coordinating conjunction connecting the first and second clauses of the sentence.
- "är" is another verb "to be", also in the present tense.
- "öppna" is a verb form (although here it's more of an adjective), describing the state of being open.
- "mot de övre planen" is a phrase describing where the subject is open to. The preposition "mot" shows the direction towards something, and "de övre planen" is the object that the subject is open to.
- "vilket" is a pronoun referring to the entire phrase "Dessa ... öppna".
- "skapar" is the main verb of the second clause, indicating that something is being created.
- "siktlinjer" is the object being created.
- "genom hela byggnaden" is a phrase describing where the object is being created through.
