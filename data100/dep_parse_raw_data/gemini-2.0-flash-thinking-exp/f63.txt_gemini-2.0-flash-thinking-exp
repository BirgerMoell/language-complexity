Here's a breakdown of the thought process to arrive at the dependency tree and average distance:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The task is to create a dependency tree for a Swedish sentence and calculate the average dependency distance. The output format is a list of tuples `(index, token, head_index)`.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence down into individual tokens. This seems straightforward for most words, but pay attention to punctuation. A comma, full stop, etc., should be its own token. This leads to: `Innan`, `kolonialtiden`, `,`, `under`, `antikens`, `grekland`, `och`, `romartiden`, `fanns`, `det`, `inget`, `som`, `liknade`, `rasismen`, `.`.

3. **Dependency Parsing (The Core Challenge):** This is the most complex part. We need to identify the head of each word and the relationship between them. I'll process the sentence roughly from left to right, considering the grammatical function of each word:

    * **`Innan`:**  This is a preposition. It modifies the main clause and establishes a temporal relationship. It seems like it should depend on the main verb, `fanns`.

    * **`kolonialtiden`:** This is a noun. It's the object of the preposition `Innan`. So, `kolonialtiden` depends on `Innan`.

    * **`,`:** Punctuation often depends on the word it's associated with. In this case, it seems to separate the initial phrase, so it likely depends on `Innan`.

    * **`under`:** Another preposition, similar to `Innan`. It also sets a temporal context and will likely depend on the main verb.

    * **`antikens`:**  This is a genitive noun modifying `grekland`. So, `antikens` depends on `grekland`.

    * **`grekland`:** This noun is the object of the preposition `under`.

    * **`och`:** This is a conjunction connecting `grekland` and `romartiden`. Conjunctions typically depend on one of the connected elements. It feels natural for `och` to depend on the first element, `grekland`.

    * **`romartiden`:**  This is another noun, also an object of the preposition `under`, and linked by `och`. It depends on `under`.

    * **`fanns`:** This is the main verb of the sentence. The root of the dependency tree. It has a subject (`det`) and an object (`inget`).

    * **`det`:** This is an expletive or dummy subject. It functions as the grammatical subject but doesn't have much semantic content. It depends on the verb `fanns`.

    * **`inget`:** This is the object of the verb `fanns`.

    * **`som`:** This is a relative pronoun introducing a relative clause modifying `inget`. It depends on `inget`.

    * **`liknade`:** This is the verb within the relative clause. Its subject is `som`, and its object is `rasismen`. It depends on `som`.

    * **`rasismen`:** This is the object of the verb `liknade`.

    * **`.`:** The sentence-ending punctuation. It typically depends on the main verb.

4. **Assign Indices:** Now, assign indices to each token starting from 1. This makes it easier to represent the dependencies numerically.

5. **Create Dependency Tuples:** Go through the tokenized sentence again and create the tuples in the required format `(index, token, head_index)`. Refer back to the dependency relationships identified in step 3. Double-check each link. For example, `kolonialtiden` at index 2 depends on `Innan` at index 1, so the tuple is `(2, kolonialtiden, 1)`.

6. **Calculate Dependency Distances:** For each tuple, the dependency distance is the absolute difference between the head index and the token index.

    * `Innan`: |1 - 9| = 8
    * `kolonialtiden`: |2 - 1| = 1
    * `,`: |3 - 1| = 2
    * `under`: |4 - 9| = 5
    * `antikens`: |5 - 6| = 1
    * `grekland`: |6 - 4| = 2
    * `och`: |7 - 6| = 1
    * `romartiden`: |8 - 4| = 4
    * `fanns`: |9 - 0| = 9
    * `det`: |10 - 9| = 1
    * `inget`: |11 - 9| = 2
    * `som`: |12 - 11| = 1
    * `liknade`: |13 - 12| = 1
    * `rasismen`: |14 - 13| = 1
    * `.`: |15 - 9| = 6

7. **Calculate Average Distance:** Sum the dependency distances and divide by the total number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens minus 1, or the number of tokens if you consider the root's dependency distance as 0 or the number of non-root nodes). In this case, there are 15 tokens. The sum of the distances is 8 + 1 + 2 + 5 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 9 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 6 = 45. The average is 45 / 15 = 3.

8. **Format the Output:**  Present the dependency tree as a list of tuples and clearly state the calculated average dependency distance.

    """

    dependency_tree = dependencies

    # Calculate average dependency distance
    total_distance = 0
    for dep in dependency_tree:
        total_distance += abs(dep[0] - dep[2])

    average_distance = total_distance / n_tokens if n_tokens > 0 else 0

    return dependency_tree, average_distance

**Explanation of the Dependency Tree:**

[(1, 'Innan', 9), (2, 'kolonialtiden', 1), (3, ',', 1), (4, 'under', 9), (5, 'antikens', 6), (6, 'grekland', 4), (7, 'och', 6), (8, 'romartiden', 4), (9, 'fanns', 0), (10, 'det', 9), (11, 'inget', 9), (12, 'som', 11), (13, 'liknade', 12), (14, 'rasismen', 13), (15, '.', 9)]

* **(1, 'Innan', 9):** The preposition "Innan" (Before) modifies the verb "fanns" (existed).
* **(2, 'kolonialtiden', 1):** The noun "kolonialtiden" (the colonial era) is the object of the preposition "Innan".
* **(3, ',', 1):** The comma separates the introductory phrase and is attached to the main preposition.
* **(4, 'under', 9):** The preposition "under" (during) also modifies the verb "fanns".
* **(5, 'antikens', 6):** The noun "antikens" (ancient's) modifies "grekland".
* **(6, 'grekland', 4):** The noun "grekland" (Greece) is the object of the preposition "under".
* **(7, 'och', 6):** The conjunction "och" (and) connects "grekland" and "romartiden", attached to the first conjunct.
* **(8, 'romartiden', 4):** The noun "romartiden" (the Roman era) is also an object of the preposition "under".
* **(9, 'fanns', 0):** The verb "fanns" (existed) is the root of the sentence.
* **(10, 'det', 9):** The expletive "det" (there) functions as a subject and depends on the verb.
* **(11, 'inget', 9):** The pronoun "inget" (nothing) is the subject complement and depends on the verb.
* **(12, 'som', 11):** The relative pronoun "som" (that/which) modifies "inget".
* **(13, 'liknade', 12):** The verb "liknade" (resembled) is the verb in the relative clause and depends on "som".
* **(14, 'rasismen', 13):** The noun "rasismen" (racism) is the object of the verb "liknade".
* **(15, '.', 9):** The period marks the end of the sentence and is attached to the main verb.

**Average dependency distance: 3.066666666666667**

This is calculated by summing the absolute differences between the head and dependent indices and dividing by the total number of tokens (15 in this case). For example, for the first tuple (1, 'Innan', 9), the distance is |1 - 9| = 8.
