Here's a breakdown of the thought process to achieve the dependency tree and average distance calculation:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The request asks for a dependency tree representation of a Swedish sentence, following a specific format, including punctuation, and then calculating the average dependency distance.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence down into individual tokens. This includes words and punctuation. I need to be careful to separate them correctly.

    * "De"
    * "hade"
    * "så"
    * "spridit"
    * "rykten"
    * "om"
    * "mörkrets"
    * "hav"
    * "för"
    * "att"
    * "skydda"
    * "sina"
    * "tillgångar"
    * "."
    * "Hur"
    * "skulle"
    * "dyra"
    * "varor"
    * "från"
    * "Asien"
    * "kunna"
    * "bli"
    * "billigare"
    * "i"
    * "Europa"
    * "?"
    * "Handel"
    * "runt"
    * "Asien"
    * "var"
    * "uppbyggd"
    * "på"
    * "många"
    * "händer"
    * "och"
    * "alla"
    * "skulle"
    * "känna"
    * "på"
    * "affärerna"
    * "."

3. **Dependency Parsing (Conceptual):** Now comes the core task: determining the head of each token. This requires understanding the grammatical relationships between the words. I'll go through the sentence chunk by chunk, identifying the head for each word. This is where linguistic knowledge is crucial. For a real-world application, I would use a dependency parser. Since this is a manual process, I'll do my best based on my understanding of Swedish grammar.

    * **Clause 1: De hade så spridit rykten om mörkrets hav för att skydda sina tillgångar.**
        * `hade` is the main verb (auxiliary).
        * `De` is the subject, depending on `hade`.
        * `spridit` is the main verb (past participle), depending on `hade`.
        * `så` modifies `spridit`.
        * `rykten` is the object of `spridit`.
        * `om` introduces a prepositional phrase.
        * `mörkrets` modifies `hav`.
        * `hav` is the object of the preposition `om`.
        * `för att` introduces a purpose clause.
        * `skydda` is the verb in the purpose clause.
        * `sina` modifies `tillgångar`.
        * `tillgångar` is the object of `skydda`.
        * `.` terminates the sentence.

    * **Clause 2: Hur skulle dyra varor från Asien kunna bli billigare i Europa?**
        * `skulle` is the auxiliary verb.
        * `Hur` is an adverb modifying the entire clause.
        * `varor` is the subject.
        * `dyra` modifies `varor`.
        * `från` introduces a prepositional phrase.
        * `Asien` is the object of `från`.
        * `kunna` is a modal verb, depending on `skulle`.
        * `bli` is the main verb.
        * `billigare` is the predicate adjective, depending on `bli`.
        * `i` introduces a prepositional phrase.
        * `Europa` is the object of `i`.
        * `?` terminates the question.

    * **Clause 3: Handel runt Asien var uppbyggd på många händer och alla skulle känna på affärerna.**
        * `var` is the main verb (auxiliary).
        * `Handel` is the subject.
        * `runt` is a preposition.
        * `Asien` is the object of `runt`.
        * `uppbyggd` is the main verb (past participle), depending on `var`.
        * `på` is a preposition.
        * `många` modifies `händer`.
        * `händer` is the object of `på`.
        * `och` is a conjunction.
        * `skulle` is the auxiliary verb.
        * `alla` is the subject.
        * `känna` is the main verb.
        * `på` is a preposition.
        * `affärerna` is the object of `på`.
        * `.` terminates the sentence.

4. **Construct the Dependency Tree (Numbered Format):** Now, translate the identified dependencies into the required numerical format. Assign a unique index to each token and determine its head's index. The root of each clause will have a head of 0.

    * Start by numbering the tokens sequentially.
    * For each token, find its head and record its index.

5. **Calculate Dependency Distances:**  For each dependency pair (head, dependent), calculate the absolute difference between their indices.

6. **Calculate Average Dependency Distance:** Sum the individual dependency distances and divide by the total number of dependencies.

7. **Review and Refine:** Double-check the dependency relationships and the calculations. Ensure the output format is correct. This is a crucial step as errors can easily occur in manual parsing. For example, making sure the head of the root verb in each main clause is '0'.
```
[(1, De, 2), (2, hade, 0), (3, så, 4), (4, spridit, 2), (5, rykten, 4), (6, om, 5), (7, mörkrets, 8), (8, hav, 6), (9, för, 11), (10, att, 9), (11, skydda, 4), (12, sina, 13), (13, tillgångar, 11), (14, ., 2), (15, Hur, 16), (16, skulle, 22), (17, dyra, 18), (18, varor, 22), (19, från, 18), (20, Asien, 19), (21, kunna, 22), (22, bli, 0), (23, billigare, 22), (24, i, 23), (25, Europa, 24), (26, ?, 22), (27, Handel, 30), (28, runt, 27), (29, Asien, 28), (30, var, 0), (31, uppbyggd, 30), (32, på, 31), (33, många, 34), (34, händer, 32), (35, och, 31), (36, alla, 37), (37, skulle, 31), (38, känna, 37), (39, på, 38), (40, affärerna, 39), (41, ., 30)]

**Calculating Average Dependency Distance:**

To calculate the average dependency distance, we sum the absolute differences between the indices of each token and its head, and then divide by the total number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens minus the root tokens, or simply the number of non-zero head indices).

Dependencies and their distances:

* |2 - 1| = 1
* |0 - 2| = 2
* |4 - 3| = 1
* |2 - 4| = 2
* |4 - 5| = 1
* |5 - 6| = 1
* |8 - 7| = 1
* |6 - 8| = 2
* |11 - 9| = 2
* |9 - 10| = 1
* |4 - 11| = 7
* |13 - 12| = 1
* |11 - 13| = 2
* |2 - 14| = 12
* |16 - 15| = 1
* |22 - 16| = 6
* |18 - 17| = 1
* |22 - 18| = 4
* |18 - 19| = 1
* |19 - 20| = 1
* |22 - 21| = 1
* |0 - 22| = 22
* |22 - 23| = 1
* |23 - 24| = 1
* |24 - 25| = 1
* |22 - 26| = 4
* |30 - 27| = 3
* |27 - 28| = 1
* |28 - 29| = 1
* |0 - 30| = 30
* |30 - 31| = 1
* |31 - 32| = 1
* |32 - 33| = 1
* |32 - 34| = 2
* |31 - 35| = 4
* |37 - 36| = 1
* |31 - 37| = 6
* |37 - 38| = 1
* |38 - 39| = 1
* |39 - 40| = 1
* |30 - 41| = 11

Sum of distances = 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 2 + 12 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 22 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 30 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 11 = **141**

Number of dependencies = 41 (total number of tokens)

Average dependency distance = 141 / 41 = **3.44** (approximately)
