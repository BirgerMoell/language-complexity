Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence and generate the dependency tree:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The request is to analyze a Swedish sentence, create a dependency tree representation, and calculate the average dependency distance. The desired output format for the dependency tree is specified.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence down into individual tokens. This includes words and punctuation. Going through the sentence "Viruset aktiveras då användaren kör det program som viruset infekterat."  identifies the following tokens:

   * Viruset
   * aktiveras
   * då
   * användaren
   * kör
   * det
   * program
   * som
   * viruset
   * infekterat
   * .

3. **Dependency Parsing (Conceptual):** The core of the task is to identify the head of each token. This involves understanding the grammatical relationships between the words. I need to consider:

   * **Subject-Verb:**  Who or what is performing the action?  "Användaren kör" (the user runs) and "Viruset aktiveras" (the virus is activated).
   * **Object:** What is the target of the action? "kör det program" (runs the program).
   * **Modifiers:**  Words or phrases that describe other words. "som viruset infekterat" modifies "program".
   * **Adverbial Clauses:** Phrases that modify the verb, often indicating time, place, or manner. "då användaren kör det program som viruset infekterat" modifies "aktiveras".
   * **Connectors:** Words that link clauses. "som" is a relative pronoun connecting the two parts of the noun phrase. "då" introduces a temporal clause.

4. **Dependency Parsing (Detailed):** Now, let's go through each token and determine its head:

   * **Viruset (1):**  The subject of "aktiveras". Head: aktiveras (2).
   * **aktiveras (2):** The main verb of the main clause. Root of the sentence. Head: 0.
   * **då (3):** A subordinating conjunction introducing the temporal clause. It modifies "aktiveras" by specifying when it happens. Head: aktiveras (2).
   * **användaren (4):** The subject of the verb "kör" in the subordinate clause. Head: kör (5).
   * **kör (5):** The verb of the subordinate clause. Its head is the conjunction "då" that introduces the clause. Head: då (3).
   * **det (6):** The determiner specifying the noun "program". Head: program (7).
   * **program (7):** The direct object of the verb "kör". Head: kör (5).
   * **som (8):** A relative pronoun, acting as the subject of "infekterat" and connecting it to "program". Head: program (7).
   * **viruset (9):** The object of the verb "infekterat" in the relative clause. Head: infekterat (10).
   * **infekterat (10):** The verb in the relative clause modifying "program". Head: som (8).
   * **. (11):** Punctuation usually attaches to the main verb. Head: aktiveras (2).

5. **Construct the Dependency Tree:**  Based on the head relationships identified above, build the list of triples:

   * (1, Viruset, 2)
   * (2, aktiveras, 0)
   * (3, då, 2)
   * (4, användaren, 5)
   * (5, kör, 3)
   * (6, det, 7)
   * (7, program, 5)
   * (8, som, 7)
   * (9, viruset, 10)
   * (10, infekterat, 8)
   * (11, ., 2)

6. **Calculate Dependency Distances:** For each token (except the root), calculate the absolute difference between its index and its head's index:

   * Viruset: |1 - 2| = 1
   * då: |3 - 2| = 1
   * användaren: |4 - 5| = 1
   * kör: |5 - 3| = 2
   * det: |6 - 7| = 1
   * program: |7 - 5| = 2
   * som: |8 - 7| = 1
   * viruset: |9 - 10| = 1
   * infekterat: |10 - 8| = 2
   * .: |11 - 2| = 9

7. **Calculate Average Dependency Distance:** Sum the individual distances and divide by the number of dependencies (which is the total number of tokens minus 1, since the root has no head):

   * Total distance = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 9 = 21
   * Number of dependencies = 11 - 1 = 10
   * Average distance = 21 / 10 = 2.1

8. **Format the Output:**  Present the dependency tree in the specified format and the calculated average dependency distance.

This systematic approach, breaking the problem down into smaller, manageable steps, ensures accurate dependency parsing and calculation of the average distance. It involves understanding grammatical relationships and carefully considering the role of each word in the sentence.
Here's the dependency tree analysis and average dependency distance for the given Swedish sentence:

**Tokens and their indices:**

1. Viruset
2. aktiveras
3. då
4. användaren
5. kör
6. det
7. program
8. som
9. viruset
10. infekterat
11. .

**Dependency Tree:**

[(1, Viruset, 2), (2, aktiveras, 0), (3, då, 2), (4, användaren, 5), (5, kör, 3), (6, det, 7), (7, program, 5), (8, som, 7), (9, viruset, 10), (10, infekterat, 8), (11, ., 2)]

**Explanation of Dependencies:**

* **(1, Viruset, 2):** "Viruset" is the subject of the verb "aktiveras".
* **(2, aktiveras, 0):** "aktiveras" is the root of the sentence.
* **(3, då, 2):** "då" (when) is a subordinate conjunction modifying the verb "aktiveras", indicating time.
* **(4, användaren, 5):** "användaren" (the user) is the subject of the verb "kör".
* **(5, kör, 3):** "kör" (runs) is the verb in the subordinate clause, with "då" as its head as it introduces the clause.
* **(6, det, 7):** "det" (the) is a determiner modifying the noun "program".
* **(7, program, 5):** "program" (program) is the direct object of the verb "kör".
* **(8, som, 7):** "som" (that/which) is a relative pronoun referring back to "program".
* **(9, viruset, 10):** "viruset" (the virus) is the object of the verb "infekterat".
* **(10, infekterat, 8):** "infekterat" (infected) is the verb in the relative clause, modifying "program" and headed by the relative pronoun "som".
* **(11, ., 2):** The period marks the end of the sentence and is attached to the main verb.

**Calculating Average Dependency Distance:**

To calculate the average dependency distance, we sum the absolute differences between the head and dependent indices for each token (excluding the root) and then divide by the number of dependencies.

* |1 - 2| = 1
* |3 - 2| = 1
* |4 - 5| = 1
* |5 - 3| = 2
* |6 - 7| = 1
* |7 - 5| = 2
* |8 - 7| = 1
* |9 - 10| = 1
* |10 - 8| = 2
* |11 - 2| = 9

Sum of distances = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 9 = 21
Number of dependencies = 10 (total tokens - 1)

Average dependency distance = 21 / 10 = **2.1**
