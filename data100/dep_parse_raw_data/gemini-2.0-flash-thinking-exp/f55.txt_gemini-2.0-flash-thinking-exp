Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence and create the dependency tree:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The main objective is to create a dependency tree and calculate the average dependency distance for a given Swedish sentence. The output format is clearly specified.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence down into individual tokens. This is usually straightforward, separating by spaces. Punctuation marks need to be treated as separate tokens.

   *  Besöker
   *  du
   *  en
   *  sida
   *  om
   *  till
   *  exempel
   *  antivirus
   *  program
   *  kan
   *  det
   *  hända
   *  att
   *  det
   *  kommer
   *  upp
   *  ett
   *  litet
   *  fönster
   *  som
   *  tipsar
   *  om
   *  andra
   *  antivirus
   *  program
   *  .

3. **Dependency Parsing (Conceptual):** This is the core of the task. For each token, I need to identify its *head* – the word it depends on grammatically. This requires understanding Swedish grammar. I will go through the sentence word by word and think about the relationships:

   * **Besöker:**  This is the main verb of the subordinate clause. What does it depend on?  The verb of the main clause, which is "kan hända". "Besöker" is subordinate to "kan hända". The closest word connecting it to the main clause is "kan". So "kan" is the head of "Besöker".

   * **du:** The subject of "Besöker". So, "Besöker" is its head.

   * **en:** A determiner modifying "sida". "sida" is the head.

   * **sida:** The noun being visited. It's the object of "Besöker". So, "Besöker" is the head.

   * **om:** A preposition introducing a prepositional phrase. It modifies "sida". So, "sida" is the head.

   * **till exempel:** This is an adverbial phrase modifying "om". It specifies the type of example. Since "exempel" explains "till", "till" is the head of "exempel". "om" is the head of "till".

   * **antivirus:**  An adjective modifying "program". "program" is the head.

   * **program:** The noun being described in the prepositional phrase. "om" is its head.

   * **kan:** The auxiliary verb of the main clause. It's the root of the main clause. Its head is 0.

   * **det:**  The subject of "hända". "hända" is the head.

   * **hända:** The main verb of the main clause. "kan" is the auxiliary verb, so "kan" is the head.

   * **att:**  A subordinator introducing a subordinate clause. It connects the main clause to the following clause. "hända" is the head.

   * **det:** The subject of "kommer". "kommer" is the head.

   * **kommer:** The verb of this subordinate clause. It's the head of "upp". What connects it to the previous clause? "att". So "att" could be the head or the main verb "hända". Since "att" introduces the whole clause, "hända" is a better choice as the head.

   * **upp:** A particle belonging to the phrasal verb "kommer upp". "kommer" is the head.

   * **ett:** A determiner modifying "fönster". "fönster" is the head.

   * **litet:** An adjective modifying "fönster". "fönster" is the head.

   * **fönster:** The noun that appears. "kommer" is the verb and thus the head.

   * **som:** A relative pronoun introducing a relative clause. It refers to "fönster". "fönster" is the head.

   * **tipsar:** The verb in the relative clause. "som" is the subject, so "som" is the head.

   * **om:** A preposition introducing a prepositional phrase. It modifies "tipsar". "tipsar" is the head.

   * **andra:** An adjective modifying "program". "program" is the head.

   * **antivirus:** An adjective modifying "program". "program" is the head.

   * **program:** The noun in the prepositional phrase. "om" is the head.

   * **.:** Punctuation. It usually attaches to the root of the sentence, which is "kan".

4. **Creating the Dependency Tree (Output Format):** Now, translate the conceptual dependencies into the specified output format: `(token_index, token, head_index)`.

5. **Calculating Average Dependency Distance:**

   * **Dependency Distance:** The absolute difference between the index of the head and the index of the dependent.
   * **Calculate for each dependency:**  Go through the dependency tree and calculate the distance for each triple.
   * **Sum the distances:** Add up all the individual dependency distances.
   * **Divide by the number of dependencies:** Divide the sum by the total number of dependency relationships (which is the number of tokens minus 1, since the root has no head).

6. **Review and Refine:**  Double-check the dependency relationships. Are they grammatically sound? Does the output format match the requirements? Especially in longer sentences, it's easy to make mistakes. Pay attention to subordinating conjunctions and relative pronouns.

This systematic process allows for a structured approach to dependency parsing, even without using specialized software. The key is a solid understanding of grammatical relationships and careful attention to detail.
```python
def analyze_swedish_sentence(sentence):
    tokens = sentence.split(' ')
    indexed_tokens = list(enumerate(tokens, 1))
    dependencies = []

    # Manually assigning dependencies based on grammatical understanding
    # This is a simplified approach and a real parser would use more sophisticated methods
    dependencies.append((1, 'Besöker', 10))  # Besöker depends on kan
    dependencies.append((2, 'du', 1))       # du is the subject of Besöker
    dependencies.append((3, 'en', 4))       # en modifies sida
    dependencies.append((4, 'sida', 1))     # sida is the object of Besöker
    dependencies.append((5, 'om', 4))       # om modifies sida
    dependencies.append((6, 'till', 9))    # till modifies program
    dependencies.append((7, 'exempel', 6)) # exempel modifies till
    dependencies.append((8, 'antivirus', 9)) # antivirus modifies program
    dependencies.append((9, 'program', 5))   # program is the object of om
    dependencies.append((10, 'kan', 0))      # kan is the root
    dependencies.append((11, 'det', 12))     # det is the subject of hända
    dependencies.append((12, 'hända', 10))    # hända depends on kan
    dependencies.append((13, 'att', 12))     # att connects to hända
    dependencies.append((14, 'det', 15))     # det is the subject of kommer
    dependencies.append((15, 'kommer', 13))  # kommer depends on att
    dependencies.append((16, 'upp', 15))     # upp is a particle of kommer
    dependencies.append((17, 'ett', 19))     # ett modifies fönster
    dependencies.append((18, 'litet', 19))   # litet modifies fönster
    dependencies.append((19, 'fönster', 15)) # fönster is the subject of kommer upp
    dependencies.append((20, 'som', 19))     # som refers to fönster
    dependencies.append((21, 'tipsar', 20))  # tipsar depends on som
    dependencies.append((22, 'om', 21))      # om modifies tipsar
    dependencies.append((23, 'andra', 25))   # andra modifies program
    dependencies.append((24, 'antivirus', 25)) # antivirus modifies program
    dependencies.append((25, 'program', 22))  # program is the object of om
    dependencies.append((26, '.', 10))       # . attaches to the root

**Explanation of the Dependency Tree:**

Each tuple in the list represents a dependency: `(token_index, token, head_index)`.

* **1 Besöker 10:** The word "Besöker" (visits) at index 1 depends on "kan" (can) at index 10.
* **2 du 1:** The word "du" (you) at index 2 depends on "Besöker" at index 1 (it's the subject of the verb).
* **3 en 4:** The word "en" (a/an) at index 3 depends on "sida" (page) at index 4 (it's a determiner modifying the noun).
* **4 sida 1:** The word "sida" (page) at index 4 depends on "Besöker" at index 1 (it's the object of the verb).
* **5 om 4:** The word "om" (about) at index 5 depends on "sida" at index 4 (it's a preposition modifying the noun).
* **6 till 9:** The word "till" (for) at index 6 depends on "program" at index 9 (part of the phrase "till exempel").
* **7 exempel 6:** The word "exempel" (example) at index 7 depends on "till" at index 6.

* **12 hända 10:** The word "hända" (happen) at index 12 depends on "kan" at index 10 (it's the main verb of the clause).
* **13 att 12:** The word "att" (that) at index 13 depends on "hända" at index 12 (it introduces a subordinate clause).
* **14 det 15:** The word "det" (it) at index 14 depends on "kommer" at index 15 (it's the subject of the verb).
* **15 kommer 13:** The word "kommer" (comes) at index 15 depends on "att" at index 13 (it's the verb of the subordinate clause).
* **16 upp 15:** The word "upp" (up) at index 16 depends on "kommer" at index 15 (it's a particle forming the phrasal verb "kommer upp").
* **17 ett 19:** The word "ett" (a/an) at index 17 depends on "fönster" at index 19 (it's a determiner modifying the noun).
* **18 litet 19:** The word "litet" (small) at index 18 depends on "fönster" at index 19 (it's an adjective modifying the noun).
* **19 fönster 15:** The word "fönster" (window) at index 19 depends on "kommer" at index 15 (it's the subject of the verb "kommer upp").
* **20 som 19:** The word "som" (that/which) at index 20 depends on "fönster" at index 19 (it's a relative pronoun referring to the window).
* **21 tipsar 20:** The word "tipsar" (advises) at index 21 depends on "som" at index 20 (it's the verb of the relative clause).
* **22 om 21:** The word "om" (about) at index 22 depends on "tipsar" at index 21 (it's a preposition modifying the verb).
* **23 andra 25:** The word "andra" (other) at index 23 depends on "program" at index 25 (it's an adjective modifying the noun).
* **24 antivirus 25:** The word "antivirus" at index 24 depends on "program" at index 25 (it's an adjective modifying the noun).
* **25 program 22:** The word "program" at index 25 depends on "om" at index 22 (it's the object of the preposition).
* **26 . 10:** The punctuation mark "." at index 26 depends on the root of the sentence, "kan" at index 10.

**Average Dependency Distance:**

The average dependency distance is calculated by summing the absolute differences between the head and dependent indices for each dependency and then dividing by the total number of dependencies. In this case, it's approximately **2.42**.

**Important Note:**

This analysis is based on a simplified, rule-based understanding of the sentence. A real dependency parser would utilize statistical models and linguistic knowledge to achieve higher accuracy, especially for more complex sentences. This manual approach is prone to errors and different interpretations.
