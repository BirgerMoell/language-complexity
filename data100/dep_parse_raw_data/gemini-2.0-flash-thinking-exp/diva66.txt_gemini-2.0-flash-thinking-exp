Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence and generate the dependency tree:

1. **Understand the Request:** The goal is to create a dependency tree for a Swedish sentence, including punctuation as tokens. The output format is specified: `(token_index, token, head_index)`. Additionally, the average dependency distance needs to be calculated.

2. **Tokenization:**  The first step is to break down the sentence into individual tokens. This involves separating words and punctuation marks. I need to be careful with punctuation that might be part of a word (like in "short-term").

   * *Initial thought:* Split by spaces.
   * *Refinement:*  Need to handle punctuation correctly. Commas, semicolons, and periods are separate tokens. Hyphens need careful consideration.

3. **Handling the Hyphen:** "Short-term" is a compound adjective. In dependency parsing, it's generally treated as a single unit, with one part depending on the other. Let's treat "short-term" as one token for simplicity, although a more nuanced parse could break it down further.

4. **Assigning Token Indices:**  Now, assign a unique index to each token, starting from 1.

   1. Possible
   2. reasons
   3. include
   4. unclear
   5. responsibilities
   6. ;
   7. short-term
   8. economic
   9. focus
   10. ;
   11. a
   12. fragmentized
   13. building
   14. process
   15. ;
   16. and
   17. lack
   18. of
   19. proper
   20. training
   21. and
   22. competence
   23. .

5. **Dependency Analysis (The Core Task):**  This is the most crucial part. I need to determine the head of each token. Think about the grammatical relationships between the words.

   * **Identifying the Root:** The main verb or predicate is usually the root of the sentence. In this case, "include" is the main verb. Its head is 0.

   * **Subject:**  What are the "reasons"? "Possible reasons". So, "reasons" depends on "include", and "Possible" modifies "reasons".

   * **Objects/Complements:** What do the reasons "include"? A series of noun phrases. These phrases are connected by semicolons and "and".

   * **Analyzing the Phrases:**
      * "unclear responsibilities": "responsibilities" is the core noun, and "unclear" modifies it.
      * "short-term economic focus": "focus" is the core noun. "economic" modifies "focus", and "short-term" modifies "economic".
      * "a fragmentized building process": "process" is the core noun. "building" modifies "process", and "fragmentized" modifies "building". "a" is a determiner for "process".
      * "lack of proper training and competence": "lack" is the core noun. "of" introduces a prepositional phrase. "training" and "competence" are coordinated, both depending on "proper", and "proper" depends on "of".

   * **Connecting with Conjunctions:**  The semicolons and "and" connect the listed reasons. They often attach to the main verb or the first element of the list. Let's consider the structure: "include A; B; C; and D". It seems logical that B, C, and D are coordinated with A, all being objects of "include".

   * **Punctuation:** Punctuation marks often attach to the head of the phrase they delimit.

6. **Constructing the Dependency Triples:** Now, put the information into the required format: `(token_index, token, head_index)`.

   * (1, Possible, 2)  // Possible modifies reasons
   * (2, reasons, 3)  // reasons is the subject of include
   * (3, include, 0)  // include is the root
   * (4, unclear, 5) // unclear modifies responsibilities
   * (5, responsibilities, 3) // responsibilities is an object of include
   * (6, ;, 5)      // Semicolon connects to the previous item in the list
   * (7, short-term, 8) // short-term modifies economic
   * (8, economic, 9) // economic modifies focus
   * (9, focus, 3)   // focus is an object of include
   * (10, ;, 9)     // Semicolon connects to the previous item
   * (11, a, 14)     // a is a determiner for process
   * (12, fragmentized, 13) // fragmentized modifies building
   * (13, building, 14) // building modifies process
   * (14, process, 3) // process is an object of include
   * (15, ;, 14)    // Semicolon connects to the previous item
   * (16, and, 17)   // and connects lack to the previous items
   * (17, lack, 3)    // lack is an object of include
   * (18, of, 17)    // of modifies lack
   * (19, proper, 18) // proper modifies the "of" phrase
   * (20, training, 19) // training modifies proper (part of the "of" phrase)
   * (21, and, 20)    // and connects training and competence
   * (22, competence, 19) // competence modifies proper (part of the "of" phrase)
   * (23, ., 3)      // Period attaches to the root

7. **Calculating Dependency Distances:** The dependency distance is the absolute difference between the head index and the dependent index.

   * |2 - 1| = 1
   * |3 - 2| = 1
   * |0 - 3| = 3
   * |5 - 4| = 1
   * |3 - 5| = 2
   * |5 - 6| = 1
   * |8 - 7| = 1
   * |9 - 8| = 1
   * |3 - 9| = 6
   * |9 - 10| = 1
   * |14 - 11| = 3
   * |13 - 12| = 1
   * |14 - 13| = 1
   * |3 - 14| = 11
   * |14 - 15| = 1
   * |17 - 16| = 1
   * |3 - 17| = 14
   * |17 - 18| = 1
   * |18 - 19| = 1
   * |19 - 20| = 1
   * |20 - 21| = 1
   * |19 - 22| = 3
   * |3 - 23| = 20

8. **Calculating the Average:** Sum the distances and divide by the number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens minus 1, as the root has no head).

   * Sum of distances = 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 11 + 1 + 1 + 14 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 20 = 76
   * Number of dependencies = 23 - 1 = 22
   * Average distance = 76 / 22 â‰ˆ 3.45

9. **Final Check:** Review the dependency tree and distances to ensure they make grammatical sense and adhere to the output format. Double-check calculations.

    dependencies.append((21, 'and', 20))    # and connects training and competence

    return dependencies

def calculate_average_dependency_distance(dependencies):
    total_distance = 0
    for dep in dependencies:
        total_distance += abs(dep[2] - dep[0])
    return total_distance / len(dependencies)

sentence = "Possible reasons include unclear responsibilities; short-term economic focus; a  fragmentized building process; and lack of proper training and competence."
dependency_tree = analyze_swedish_sentence(sentence)

**Explanation of the Dependency Tree:**

The output `[(1, 'Possible', 2), (2, 'reasons', 3), (3, 'include', 0), (4, 'unclear', 5), (5, 'responsibilities', 3), (6, ';', 5), (7, 'short-term', 9), (8, 'economic', 9), (9, 'focus', 3), (10, ';', 9), (11, 'a', 14), (12, 'fragmentized', 14), (13, 'building', 14), (14, 'process', 3), (15, ';', 14), (16, 'and', 17), (17, 'lack', 3), (18, 'of', 17), (19, 'proper', 18), (20, 'training', 19), (21, 'and', 20), (22, 'competence', 19), (23, '.', 3)]` represents the dependency relationships in the sentence:

* **(1, 'Possible', 2):** The word "Possible" (token 1) depends on "reasons" (token 2). "Reasons" is the head.
* **(2, 'reasons', 3):** The word "reasons" (token 2) depends on "include" (token 3). "Include" is the head.
* **(3, 'include', 0):** The word "include" (token 3) is the root of the sentence, hence its head is 0.
* **(4, 'unclear', 5):** "unclear" (token 4) modifies "responsibilities" (token 5).
* **(5, 'responsibilities', 3):** "responsibilities" (token 5) is an object of "include" (token 3).
* **(6, ';', 5):** The semicolon (token 6) likely depends on the preceding element in the list, "responsibilities" (token 5).
* **(7, 'short-term', 9):** "short-term" (token 7) modifies "focus" (token 9).
* **(8, 'economic', 9):** "economic" (token 8) modifies "focus" (token 9).
* **(9, 'focus', 3):** "focus" (token 9) is another object of "include" (token 3).
* **(10, ';', 9):** The semicolon (token 10) depends on the preceding element, "focus" (token 9).
* **(11, 'a', 14):** The article "a" (token 11) modifies "process" (token 14).
* **(12, 'fragmentized', 14):** "fragmentized" (token 12) modifies "process" (token 14).
* **(13, 'building', 14):** "building" (token 13) modifies "process" (token 14).
* **(14, 'process', 3):** "process" (token 14) is another object of "include" (token 3).
* **(15, ';', 14):** The semicolon (token 15) depends on the preceding element, "process" (token 14).
* **(16, 'and', 17):** The conjunction "and" (token 16) connects the following element ("lack") to the previous list of reasons.
* **(17, 'lack', 3):** "lack" (token 17) is another object of "include" (token 3).
* **(18, 'of', 17):** The preposition "of" (token 18) depends on "lack" (token 17).
* **(19, 'proper', 18):** "proper" (token 19) modifies the phrase introduced by "of" (token 18).
* **(20, 'training', 19):** "training" (token 20) depends on "proper" (token 19).
* **(21, 'and', 20):** The conjunction "and" (token 21) connects "training" and "competence".
* **(22, 'competence', 19):** "competence" (token 22) also depends on "proper" (token 19).
* **(23, '.', 3):** The full stop (token 23) typically attaches to the root of the sentence, "include" (token 3).

**Average Dependency Distance:**

The average dependency distance is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between the head and dependent token indices, divided by the number of dependencies. In this case, the average dependency distance is **3.478...**

**Important Note:**

This analysis is a simplified representation and might vary depending on the specific dependency parsing guidelines and tools used. In a real-world scenario, you would use a dedicated dependency parser for Swedish (e.g., Stanza, UDPipe trained on Swedish data) to get a more accurate and consistent dependency tree. This manual analysis serves as an illustration of the concept.
