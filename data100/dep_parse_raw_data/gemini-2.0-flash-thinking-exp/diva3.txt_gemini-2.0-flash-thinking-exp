Here's a breakdown of the thought process used to analyze the Swedish sentence and create the dependency tree:

1. **Understanding the Request:** The core task is to create a dependency tree for a given Swedish sentence. This means identifying the head of each word and its dependents. The output format is specified: `(token_index, token, head_index)`. Punctuation needs to be treated as tokens. Finally, the average dependency distance needs to be calculated.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break down the sentence into individual tokens. This is generally straightforward, separating words and punctuation. Crucially, the instructions emphasize including punctuation.

   *  Examensarbetet
   *  har
   *  utförts
   *  vid
   *  institutionen
   *  för
   *  Transportteknik
   *  ,
   *  avdelningen
   *  för
   *  Väg-
   *  och
   *  Banteknik
   *  på
   *  uppdrag
   *  av
   *  Structor
   *  Mark
   *  Stockholm
   *  AB
   *  och
   *  omfattar
   *  30
   *  högskolepoäng
   *  .

3. **Identifying the Root:**  The root of the dependency tree is typically the main verb of the sentence. In this case, "omfattar" (encompasses) seems to be the main action. However, upon closer inspection, "har utförts" (has been carried out) functions as a passive verb phrase and carries the primary meaning. Therefore, "utförts" will likely be the root.

4. **Analyzing Word Relationships (Dependency Parsing):** This is the most complex part. We need to consider how each word relates grammatically to other words. This often involves understanding the meaning of the words and their function in the sentence. I'll go through the sentence token by token, making initial connections and then refining them:

   * **Examensarbetet:**  The subject of the sentence. It performs the action of being carried out. So, it depends on "utförts".
   * **har:** An auxiliary verb supporting "utförts". It depends on "utförts".
   * **utförts:** The main verb (in passive voice). It's the root of the clause.
   * **vid:** A preposition indicating location. It modifies "utförts".
   * **institutionen:** The object of the preposition "vid". It depends on "vid".
   * **för:** A preposition linking "institutionen" and "Transportteknik". It modifies "institutionen".
   * **Transportteknik:**  The object of the preposition "för". It depends on "för".
   * **,:**  Punctuation. It likely attaches to the nearest major clause element, in this case, "institutionen". (Alternative: could attach to the following clause starter).
   * **avdelningen:**  Appears to be another location/department where the work was done. It's likely coordinated with "institutionen". A coordinating conjunction is missing, implying an implicit "och". Let's initially attach it to "institutionen". *Correction:*  The next "för" indicates it's likely part of a similar prepositional phrase.
   * **för:** A preposition linking "avdelningen" and "Väg- och Banteknik". It modifies "avdelningen".
   * **Väg-:** Part of a compound noun.
   * **och:** A conjunction coordinating "Väg-" and "Banteknik". It depends on "Väg-".
   * **Banteknik:** Part of a compound noun, coordinated with "Väg-". It depends on "och".
   * **på:** A preposition indicating the commissioning entity. It modifies "utförts".
   * **uppdrag:** The object of the preposition "på". It depends on "på".
   * **av:** A preposition linking "uppdrag" and "Structor Mark Stockholm AB". It modifies "uppdrag".
   * **Structor:** Part of a multi-word named entity.
   * **Mark:** Part of a multi-word named entity.
   * **Stockholm:** Part of a multi-word named entity.
   * **AB:** Part of a multi-word named entity. These will form a chain of dependencies.
   * **och:** A conjunction coordinating the first part of the sentence ("Examensarbetet har utförts...") and the second part ("omfattar 30 högskolepoäng"). It will depend on the root of the first clause, "utförts". *Correction:*  It likely coordinates the two main verbs.
   * **omfattar:**  The second main verb. It's coordinated with "utförts".
   * **30:**  A numerical quantifier modifying "högskolepoäng". It depends on "högskolepoäng".
   * **högskolepoäng:** The object of the verb "omfattar". It depends on "omfattar".
   * **.:** Punctuation, attached to the root of the sentence, which is "utförts" in this clause. *Correction:* Attach to the main verb of the entire sentence, which is "omfattar" given the coordination.

5. **Refining and Correcting:**  Review the initial connections. Are there any ambiguities?  Does the meaning flow correctly?  For instance, the coordination with "och" needs careful consideration. "omfattar" acts as a second main verb.

6. **Assigning Indices:** Once the dependency structure is reasonably clear, assign numerical indices to each token, starting from 1.

7. **Generating the Triples:**  Create the `(token_index, token, head_index)` tuples based on the determined dependencies. The root verb will have a head index of 0.

8. **Calculating Average Dependency Distance:**
   * Calculate the dependency distance for each token: `abs(token_index - head_index)`.
   * Sum the distances.
   * Divide the sum by the total number of tokens.

**Self-Correction Example during the process:** Initially, I thought "omfattar" was the root. However, recognizing the passive voice of "har utförts" and the coordinating conjunction "och" shifted the understanding. The coordination suggests two parallel main clauses, making both "utförts" and "omfattar" important. However, grammatically, "utförts" comes first and sets the initial action, making it a better candidate for the root of the *first part* of the sentence. The "och" then links the second part, with "omfattar" as its main verb. This indicates a coordination at the clause level, not simply of verbs dependent on a single root. I decided to make "omfattar" the ultimate root, as it feels like the overarching statement of what the thesis *does*. Another approach could be to link both verbs to a virtual root, but the specified output format makes having a single root more practical. Given the structure, "omfattar" appears to be the main, final statement.

Another correction:  The commas separating phrases should attach to the head of the phrase they are delimiting.

By following these steps, iterating, and correcting along the way, the final dependency tree and average dependency distance can be accurately derived.

[(1, Examensarbetet, 3), (2, har, 3), (3, utförts, 0), (4, vid, 3), (5, institutionen, 4), (6, för, 5), (7, Transportteknik, 6), (8, ,, 5), (9, avdelningen, 5), (10, för, 9), (11, Väg-, 12), (12, och, 10), (13, Banteknik, 12), (14, på, 3), (15, uppdrag, 14), (16, av, 15), (17, Structor, 20), (18, Mark, 17), (19, Stockholm, 18), (20, AB, 16), (21, och, 3), (22, omfattar, 3), (23, 30, 24), (24, högskolepoäng, 22), (25, ., 3)]
```

**Dependency Distances and Average:**

Let's calculate the dependency distance for each token:

* 1: |1 - 3| = 2
* 2: |2 - 3| = 1
* 3: |3 - 0| = 3
* 4: |4 - 3| = 1
* 5: |5 - 4| = 1
* 6: |6 - 5| = 1
* 7: |7 - 6| = 1
* 8: |8 - 5| = 3
* 9: |9 - 5| = 4
* 10: |10 - 9| = 1
* 11: |11 - 12| = 1
* 12: |12 - 10| = 2
* 13: |13 - 12| = 1
* 14: |14 - 3| = 11
* 15: |15 - 14| = 1
* 16: |16 - 15| = 1
* 17: |17 - 20| = 3
* 18: |18 - 17| = 1
* 19: |19 - 18| = 1
* 20: |20 - 16| = 4
* 21: |21 - 3| = 18
* 22: |22 - 3| = 19
* 23: |23 - 24| = 1
* 24: |24 - 22| = 2
* 25: |25 - 3| = 22

Sum of distances = 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 11 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 18 + 19 + 1 + 2 + 22 = 105

Number of tokens = 25

Average dependency distance = 105 / 25 = **4.2**
