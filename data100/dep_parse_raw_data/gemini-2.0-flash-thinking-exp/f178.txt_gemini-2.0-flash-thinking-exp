Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence and create the dependency tree:

1. **Understanding the Goal:** The request asks for a dependency analysis of a Swedish sentence, including a dependency tree represented as a list of tuples and the average dependency distance.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence down into individual tokens. This involves recognizing words and punctuation marks as separate units. Care must be taken with compound words or hyphenated words, but in this case, it seems straightforward.

   *Polyperna*, *blir*, *färgglada*, *och*, *får*, *genom*, *fotosyntes*, *ca*, *90*, *%*, *energi*, *,*, *tack*, *vare*, *den*, *grönalg*, *,*, *zooxanthell*, *,*, *som*, *finns*, *inne*, *i*, *varje*, *polyp*, *.

3. **Identifying the Root:**  In a dependency tree, the root is the main verb of the sentence. Scanning the sentence, "blir" (become) and "får" (get) appear to be the main verbs connected by "och" (and). This indicates a coordination. The first main verb, "blir", is usually chosen as the overall root in such cases.

4. **Establishing Dependencies - "blir" branch:**

   * **Subject:** Who or what becomes colorful?  "Polyperna" (The polyps). So, `Polyperna` depends on `blir`.
   * **Complement/Attribute:** What do the polyps become? "färgglada" (colorful). So, `färgglada` depends on `blir`.
   * **Conjunction:** "och" (and) connects the two clauses. `och` depends on the first verb, `blir`.

5. **Establishing Dependencies - "får" branch:**

   * **Coordinating Conjunction Head:** Since "får" is coordinated with "blir", it depends on "blir".
   * **Manner/Means:** How do they get energy? "genom fotosyntes" (through photosynthesis). `genom` depends on `får`, and `fotosyntes` depends on `genom`.
   * **Quantity:** How much energy? "ca 90 %" (approximately 90%). `ca` modifies `90`, `90` modifies `%`, and `%` modifies `energi`. `energi` depends on `får`.
   * **Interjection/Adverbial:** "tack vare" (thanks to) introduces a reason. `tack` depends on `får`, and `vare` depends on `tack`.
   * **Determiner:** Which algae? "den" (the). `den` depends on `grönalg`.
   * **Noun:** The algae: "grönalg" (green algae). `grönalg` depends on `vare`.
   * **Apposition:** "zooxanthell" further specifies the type of algae. `zooxanthell` depends on `grönalg`.
   * **Relative Pronoun:** "som" (that/which) introduces a relative clause. `som` depends on `grönalg`.
   * **Verb in Relative Clause:** What does the algae do? "finns" (exists/is). `finns` depends on `som`.
   * **Adverbial Location:** Where does it exist? "inne i varje polyp" (inside every polyp). `inne` depends on `finns`. `i` depends on `inne`. `varje` modifies `polyp`, so `varje` depends on `polyp`. `polyp` depends on `i`.

6. **Punctuation:**  Punctuation usually depends on the word it is most closely associated with or the root of the clause it's in. Commas often separate phrases or clauses. The final full stop marks the end of the sentence and depends on the root.

7. **Assigning Indices:**  Now, go back and assign an index to each token based on its position in the sentence, starting from 1.

8. **Constructing the Dependency Tree (Tuples):**  Create the list of tuples. For each token, identify its head and its index.

9. **Calculating Dependency Distances:** For each dependency, calculate the absolute difference between the index of the dependent and the index of the head.

10. **Calculating Average Dependency Distance:** Sum the individual dependency distances and divide by the total number of dependencies.

11. **Review and Refine:** Double-check the dependencies and the calculations. Make sure the root is correctly identified and that all words have a head (except the root, which has a head of 0). Ensure punctuation is correctly handled. For example, commas often depend on the main verb of the clause they're separating.

This systematic approach ensures that all parts of the sentence are considered and their relationships are accurately captured in the dependency tree. It also helps to avoid missing any dependencies or making incorrect connections.

**Explanation of the Dependency Tree:**

Each tuple in the `dependency_tree` list represents a dependency relation:

* **(dependent_index, dependent_token, head_index)**

Here's a breakdown for the given sentence:

* **(1, 'Polyperna', 2):** The noun "Polyperna" (The polyps) is the subject and depends on the verb "blir".
* **(2, 'blir', 0):** The verb "blir" (become) is the root of the first clause and has no head (represented by 0).
* **(3, 'färgglada', 2):** The adjective "färgglada" (colorful) is a predicative complement and depends on "blir".
* **(4, 'och', 5):** The conjunction "och" (and) coordinates the two verb phrases and depends on the second verb "får".
* **(5, 'får', 2):** The verb "får" (get) is coordinated with "blir" and depends on it.
* **(6, 'genom', 5):** The preposition "genom" (through) introduces an adverbial phrase and depends on "får".
* **(7, 'fotosyntes', 6):** The noun "fotosyntes" (photosynthesis) is the object of the preposition "genom".
* **(8, 'ca', 11):** The adverb "ca" (approximately) modifies the quantity "90 % energi". It's attached to the head of that phrase.
* **(9, '90', 10):** The number "90" modifies the percent symbol.
* **(10, '%', 11):** The percent symbol modifies the noun "energi".
* **(11, 'energi', 5):** The noun "energi" (energy) is the direct object of the verb "får".
* **(12, ',', 5):** The comma separates the adverbial phrase and depends on the main verb of the clause.
* **(13, 'tack', 15):** The noun "tack" is part of the phrase "tack vare" and depends on "vare".
* **(14, 'vare', 5):** The preposition "vare" is part of the phrase "tack vare" (thanks to) and introduces an adverbial phrase, depending on "får".
* **(15, 'den', 17):** The determiner "den" (the) modifies the noun "grönalg".
* **(16, 'grönalg', 14):** The noun "grönalg" (green algae) is the object of the preposition "vare".
* **(17, ',', 14):** The comma separates the appositive phrase and depends on the element it modifies.
* **(18, 'zooxanthell', 16):** The noun "zooxanthell" is in apposition to "grönalg".
* **(19, ',', 14):** The comma separates the relative clause and depends on the element it modifies.
* **(20, 'som', 21):** The relative pronoun "som" (that/which) introduces the relative clause and depends on the verb within that clause.
* **(21, 'finns', 16):** The verb "finns" (exists/is) is the main verb of the relative clause and modifies "grönalg".
* **(22, 'inne', 21):** The adverb "inne" (inside) modifies the verb "finns".
* **(23, 'i', 22):** The preposition "i" (in) introduces a prepositional phrase modifying "inne".
* **(24, 'varje', 25):** The determiner "varje" (every) modifies the noun "polyp".
* **(25, 'polyp', 23):** The noun "polyp" is the object of the preposition "i".
* **(26, '.', 2):** The full stop marks the end of the sentence and typically depends on the main root verb.

**Average Dependency Distance:**

The average dependency distance is calculated by taking the absolute difference between the index of the dependent and the index of its head for each dependency (excluding the root which has a head of 0), summing these distances, and then dividing by the total number of dependencies.

**Important Note:**

Manually creating dependency trees is complex and prone to errors, especially for longer and more intricate sentences. In real-world NLP tasks, this is almost always done using specialized libraries and models trained for dependency parsing (e.g., SpaCy, Stanza, UDPipe). The manual analysis above is for illustrative purposes to understand the underlying concepts.
