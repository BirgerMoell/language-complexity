Here's a breakdown of the thought process to arrive at the dependency tree and average dependency distance:

1. **Understand the Task:** The goal is to create a dependency tree and calculate the average dependency distance for the given Swedish sentence. The output format requires tuples: `(token_index, token, head_index)`. Punctuation is also a token.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence down into individual tokens. This is crucial for numbering and linking. I'll go through the sentence word by word, including punctuation:

   * Bachelor
   * of
   * Science
   * Thesis
   * TMT
   * 2013:09
   * :
   * Accessories
   * for
   * the
   * workplace
   * of
   * future
   * Alicia
   * Brander
   * Emma
   * Hamilton
   * Approved
   * {2013-01-21
   * Examiner
   * KTH
   * Ola
   * Narbrink
   * Supervisor
   * KTH
   * Erika
   * Bellander
   * Commissioner
   * Lammhults
   * Contact
   * person
   * at
   * company
   * Andreas
   * Mattiassson
   * Abstract
   * The
   * essay
   * describes
   * the
   * need
   * for
   * solutions
   * in
   * offices
   * in
   * form
   * of
   * accessories
   * that
   * support
   * an
   * activity-based
   * approach
   * .

3. **Dependency Parsing (The Core Logic):** This is the most complex part. I need to determine the grammatical relationships between the tokens. I'll go through the sentence and for each token, identify its head (the word it modifies or depends on). This requires some linguistic knowledge of Swedish sentence structure (or at least general grammatical principles).

   * **"Bachelor of Science Thesis TMT 2013:09 : Accessories for the workplace of future"**: This appears to be a title or a heading. "Accessories" is the most likely main noun. The other words describe it.
      * "Bachelor" modifies "Thesis" (or maybe part of a compound noun).
      * "of" connects "Bachelor" and "Science".
      * "Science" modifies "Bachelor".
      * "Thesis" is the central concept here.
      * "TMT" and "2013:09" are likely identifiers for the thesis.
      * ":" acts as a separator.
      * "for" introduces a prepositional phrase modifying "Accessories".
      * "the" is a determiner for "workplace".
      * "workplace" is the noun in the prepositional phrase.
      * "of" connects "workplace" and "future".
      * "future" modifies "workplace".

   * **"Alicia Brander Emma Hamilton Approved"**: This seems like author information. "Approved" likely refers to the thesis being approved.
      * "Alicia" and "Brander" are likely a compound noun (author name).
      * "Emma" and "Hamilton" are another compound noun (author name).
      * "Approved" is likely the main verb (even though it's past participle, semantically it acts as a verb stating the thesis's status).

   * **"{2013-01-21 Examiner KTH Ola Narbrink Supervisor KTH Erika Bellander Commissioner Lammhults Contact person at company Andreas Mattiassson"**:  This section provides information about the approval and supervisors.
      * "{2013-01-21" likely modifies "Approved".
      * "Examiner" is a role.
      * "KTH" likely modifies "Examiner".
      * "Ola Narbrink" is the name of the examiner.
      * "Supervisor" is another role.
      * "KTH" likely modifies "Supervisor".
      * "Erika Bellander" is the name of the supervisor.
      * "Commissioner" is another role.
      * "Lammhults" likely modifies "Commissioner".
      * "Contact person" is a compound noun.
      * "at company" modifies "person".
      * "Andreas Mattiassson" is the name of the contact person.

   * **"Abstract The essay describes the need for solutions in offices in form of accessories that support an activity-based approach ."**: This is the main sentence describing the thesis.
      * "Abstract" likely introduces this section.
      * "The" is a determiner for "essay".
      * "essay" is the subject.
      * "describes" is the main verb.
      * "the" is a determiner for "need".
      * "need" is the object of "describes".
      * "for" introduces a prepositional phrase modifying "need".
      * "solutions" is the noun in that phrase.
      * "in" introduces a prepositional phrase modifying "solutions".
      * "offices" is the noun in that phrase.
      * "in" introduces another prepositional phrase modifying "solutions".
      * "form" is the noun in that phrase.
      * "of" connects "form" and "accessories".
      * "accessories" is the noun in that phrase.
      * "that" is a relative pronoun, acting as the subject of "support".
      * "support" is the verb of the relative clause.
      * "an" is a determiner for "approach".
      * "activity-based" modifies "approach".
      * "approach" is the object of "support".
      * "." is the sentence terminator.

4. **Assigning Head Indices:** Now, for each token, I assign the index of its head. The root of the sentence will have a head index of 0. This requires careful consideration of the dependencies established in the previous step. I'll go through each token and its likely head.

5. **Formatting the Output:**  Finally, I organize the information into the required tuples: `(token_index, token, head_index)`.

6. **Calculating Average Dependency Distance:**
   * Calculate the dependency distance for each token: `abs(token_index - head_index)`.
   * Sum the dependency distances.
   * Divide the sum by the total number of tokens (excluding the root if it was explicitly represented with an index).

**Self-Correction/Refinement During the Process:**

* **Ambiguity:**  Sometimes, dependency relations can be ambiguous. For example, "Bachelor of Science" could be treated as a single unit or with "of" as a head. I'll aim for the most common or logical interpretation in a typical dependency parsing framework.
* **Long Sentences:**  Long sentences with multiple clauses and prepositional phrases can be challenging. I need to be systematic in identifying the core verb and its arguments and then the modifiers.
* **Head Selection:**  The choice of head can impact the dependency distance. Consistency is key. For instance, determiners usually depend on the noun they modify. Prepositions usually head the prepositional phrase.
* **Punctuation:**  Remembering to include punctuation as tokens is important for accurate indexing and distance calculation. Punctuation often depends on the main verb or the preceding word.

By following these steps and being mindful of potential ambiguities, I can construct the dependency tree and calculate the average dependency distance. The key is to break down the task into manageable parts and apply linguistic knowledge (or reasonable assumptions if unsure).

**Average Dependency Distance Calculation:**

1. **Calculate the dependency distance for each token:**
   - |1 - 4| = 3
   - |2 - 1| = 1
   - |3 - 2| = 1
   - |4 - 8| = 4
   - |5 - 4| = 1
   - |6 - 4| = 2
   - |7 - 4| = 3
   - |8 - 0| = 8
   - |9 - 8| = 1
   - |10 - 11| = 1
   - |11 - 9| = 2
   - |12 - 11| = 1
   - |13 - 12| = 1
   - |14 - 18| = 4
   - |15 - 14| = 1
   - |16 - 18| = 2
   - |17 - 16| = 1
   - |18 - 8| = 10
   - |19 - 18| = 1
   - |20 - 18| = 2
   - |21 - 20| = 1
   - |22 - 24| = 2
   - |23 - 22| = 1
   - |24 - 18| = 6
   - |25 - 24| = 1
   - |26 - 27| = 1
   - |27 - 24| = 3
   - |28 - 18| = 10
   - |29 - 28| = 1
   - |30 - 31| = 1
   - |31 - 18| = 13
   - |32 - 31| = 1
   - |33 - 32| = 1
   - |34 - 35| = 1
   - |35 - 31| = 4
   - |36 - 39| = 3
   - |37 - 38| = 1
   - |38 - 39| = 1
   - |39 - 8| = 31
   - |40 - 41| = 1
   - |41 - 39| = 2
   - |42 - 41| = 1
   - |43 - 42| = 1
   - |44 - 43| = 1
   - |45 - 44| = 1
   - |46 - 43| = 3
   - |47 - 46| = 1
   - |48 - 47| = 1
   - |49 - 48| = 1
   - |50 - 51| = 1
   - |51 - 49| = 2
   - |52 - 53| = 1
   - |53 - 54| = 1
   - |54 - 51| = 3
   - |55 - 39| = 16

2. **Sum the dependency distances:** 3 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 8 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 13 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 31 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 16 = **178**

3. **Divide the sum by the total number of tokens (55):** 178 / 55 = **3.2363636363636366**

**Therefore, the average dependency distance for the sentence is approximately 3.24.**
