Here's a breakdown of the thought process to arrive at the dependency tree and average dependency distance:

1. **Understand the Request:** The core task is to create a dependency tree representation for a Swedish sentence and calculate the average dependency distance. The output format is specified.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break down the sentence into individual tokens. This includes words, punctuation, and even the compound "sporten/hobbyn."  It's important to assign an index to each token.

   * *Initial Thought:*  Split by spaces.
   * *Refinement:* Realize that punctuation needs to be its own token. The slash in "sporten/hobbyn" also acts as a separator of sorts, but treating it as a single token seems most appropriate in this context, representing a single concept.

3. **Dependency Parsing (The Core Task):** This is the most complex step and requires understanding Swedish grammar. For each token, identify its head (the word it depends on). The root of the sentence will depend on nothing (or itself, represented by 0).

   * *Starting Point:* Look for the main verb. In this sentence, "kom" (came) is the finite verb and likely the root.

   * *Working through the Sentence (Left to Right):*
      * "Till":  A preposition modifying "kom," indicating direction. So, "kom" is the head.
      * "Sverige":  The place where the sport came to, so it depends on "Till."
      * "kom":  The main verb, the root. Head is 0.
      * "sporten/hobbyn": The subject of "kom."  Depends on "kom."
      * "under": A preposition indicating time, modifying "kom."
      * "1700-talet": The object of the preposition "under."
      * "och": A coordinating conjunction connecting two clauses. It will likely depend on the head of the second clause ("blev").
      * "blev":  The main verb of the second clause. What does it connect to? The previous verb "kom."
      * "efter": A preposition modifying "blev," indicating a time frame.
      * "ett": A determiner modifying "tag."
      * "tag": The object of the preposition "efter."
      * "en": A determiner modifying "söndagshobby."
      * "populär": An adjective modifying "söndagshobby."
      * "söndagshobby": The object of the verb "blev."
      * ".": Punctuation, usually depending on the root of the clause it belongs to, which is "blev" in this case.

   * *Self-Correction/Refinement:* Initially, one might think "och" depends on "kom." However, it connects *clauses*, so it's more accurate to have it depend on the head of the second clause ("blev"). This reflects the coordination structure. Similarly, the punctuation marks often attach to the main verb of their respective clauses.

4. **Representing the Dependency Tree:** Format the dependencies as requested: `(token_index, token, head_index)`. Ensure the indices are correct and correspond to the tokenization.

5. **Calculating Dependency Distance:**

   * *Definition:* Dependency distance is the absolute difference between the index of the dependent and the index of the head.
   * *Iterate Through Dependencies:* For each dependency tuple, subtract the head index from the token index and take the absolute value.
   * *Sum the Distances:* Add up all the individual dependency distances.
   * *Calculate the Average:* Divide the total dependency distance by the number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens minus 1, or the number of non-root tokens).

6. **Final Output:** Present the dependency tree and the average dependency distance clearly. Double-check the indexing and calculations.

**Explanation of the Dependency Tree:**

* **(1, 'Till', 3):** The preposition "Till" (to) modifies the verb "kom" (came).
* **(2, 'Sverige', 1):** The noun "Sverige" (Sweden) is the object of the preposition "Till".
* **(3, 'kom', 0):** The verb "kom" is the root of the main clause.
* **(4, 'sporten', 3):** The noun "sporten" (the sport) is the subject of the verb "kom".
* **(5, 'hobbyn', 3):** The noun "hobbyn" (the hobby) is also a subject of "kom", coordinated with "sporten". We're simplifying the coordination here by having both directly depend on "kom". A more nuanced analysis might introduce a coordination node.
* **(6, 'under', 3):** The preposition "under" (during/in) modifies the verb "kom".
* **(7, '1700-talet', 6):** The noun phrase "1700-talet" (the 18th century) is the object of the preposition "under".
* **(8, 'och', 9):** The conjunction "och" (and) connects the two clauses. It's headed by the main verb of the second clause, "blev".
* **(9, 'blev', 3):** The verb "blev" (became) is the root of the second clause and is coordinated with "kom".
* **(10, 'efter', 9):** The preposition "efter" (after) modifies the verb "blev".
* **(11, 'ett', 12):** The determiner "ett" (a) modifies the noun "tag".
* **(12, 'tag', 10):** The noun "tag" (while/bit) is the object of the preposition "efter".
* **(13, 'en', 15):** The determiner "en" (a) modifies the noun "söndagshobby".
* **(14, 'populär', 15):** The adjective "populär" (popular) modifies the noun "söndagshobby".
* **(15, 'söndagshobby', 9):** The noun "söndagshobby" (Sunday hobby) is the subject complement of the verb "blev".
* **(16, '.', 9):** The full stop punctuates the second clause and is attached to the main verb of that clause.

**Average Dependency Distance Calculation:**

The dependency distances for each token are:

* |1 - 3| = 2
* |2 - 1| = 1
* |3 - 0| = 3
* |4 - 3| = 1
* |5 - 3| = 2
* |6 - 3| = 3
* |7 - 6| = 1
* |8 - 9| = 1
* |9 - 3| = 6
* |10 - 9| = 1
* |11 - 12| = 1
* |12 - 10| = 2
* |13 - 15| = 2
* |14 - 15| = 1
* |15 - 9| = 6
* |16 - 9| = 7

Total dependency distance = 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 7 = 40
Number of dependencies = 16
Average dependency distance = 40 / 16 = 2.5

**Output:**

```
[(1, 'Till', 3), (2, 'Sverige', 1), (3, 'kom', 0), (4, 'sporten', 3), (5, 'hobbyn', 3), (6, 'under', 3), (7, '1700-talet', 6), (8, 'och', 9), (9, 'blev', 3), (10, 'efter', 9), (11, 'ett', 12), (12, 'tag', 10), (13, 'en', 15), (14, 'populär', 15), (15, 'söndagshobby', 9), (16, '.', 9)]
Average dependency distance: 2.5
```
