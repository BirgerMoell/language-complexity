Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence (even though it's in English, the request asks for Swedish sentence analysis and dependency tree output format, which is the key):

1. **Identify the Core Task:** The main goal is to create a dependency tree and calculate the average dependency distance. The output format is specifically requested to be triples: `(token_index, token, head_index)`.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break down the sentence into individual tokens. This is relatively straightforward, separating words and punctuation. We need to be careful with parentheses – they count as separate tokens.

3. **Dependency Parsing (Conceptual):** Now comes the more complex part – figuring out the relationships between the words. This involves understanding the grammatical structure of the sentence. Even without being a Swedish speaker, we can use general linguistic knowledge and the requested output format to guide us. We need to identify the head (governor) of each word.

4. **Identifying the Main Verb:** The central element of most sentences is the main verb. In this case, "was selected" seems to be the core action. This will likely have a head index of 0.

5. **Subject Identification:**  Who or what performed the action?  "An academic benchmark case (Unsteady Aerodynamics Experiment Phase III)" seems to be the subject. The most likely head within this phrase is "case".

6. **Working Through Modifiers and Arguments:**  Now, we systematically go through each word and determine its head.

    * **"An"**: Modifies "case".
    * **"academic"**: Modifies "case".
    * **"benchmark"**: Modifies "case".
    * **"("**:  Seems to be associated with the following noun phrase. It probably modifies "Experiment".
    * **"Unsteady"**: Modifies "Aerodynamics".
    * **"Aerodynamics"**: Modifies "Experiment".
    * **"Experiment"**: Modifies "case".
    * **"Phase"**: Modifies "Experiment".
    * **"III"**: Modifies "Phase".
    * **")"**:  Marks the end of the parenthetical phrase and likely modifies "case".
    * **"was"**:  Part of the verb phrase, depends on "selected".
    * **"selected"**: The main verb, head is 0.
    * **"as"**:  Introduces a prepositional phrase acting as an adverbial. It likely depends on "selected".
    * **"a"**:  Modifies "point".
    * **"starting"**: Modifies "point".
    * **"point"**:  The noun in the prepositional phrase, depends on "as".
    * **"of"**:  Connects "point" and "optimization".
    * **"the"**: Modifies "optimization".
    * **"optimization"**: Depends on "point".
    * **"because"**: Introduces a subordinate clause, likely dependent on "selected".
    * **"wind"**: Modifies "data".
    * **"tunnel"**: Modifies "data".
    * **"data"**: The subject of the subordinate clause's verb, depends on "available".
    * **"was"**: Part of the subordinate clause's verb, depends on "available".
    * **"available"**: The main verb of the subordinate clause, depends on "because".
    * **"for"**: Introduces a prepositional phrase.
    * **"that"**: Modifies "campain".
    * **"campain"**: Depends on "for".
    * **"."**: Terminates the sentence, depends on the root verb "selected".

7. **Assigning Indices:** Now that the dependencies are roughly determined, assign numerical indices to each token starting from 1. Then, for each token, note the index of its head.

8. **Constructing the Triples:**  Format the information into the required triples: `(token_index, token, head_index)`.

9. **Calculating Dependency Distance:**  For each triple, calculate the absolute difference between the token index and the head index.

10. **Calculating Average Distance:** Sum the individual dependency distances and divide by the total number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens minus 1, as the root has no head).

11. **Review and Refine:**  Double-check the dependencies. Do they make sense grammatically?  Are the indices correct?  Even though the sentence is in English, pretend it's Swedish and apply the expected output format rigorously.

**Self-Correction/Refinement during the process:**

* **Initial thought:** Might be tempted to make "was" the head of "selected". However,  "selected" is the semantic head.
* **Parentheses:** Initially, I might have grouped the entire parenthetical phrase. But the requirement is for each item to be a token.
* **Subordinate Clause:** Identifying the head of the subordinate clause can be tricky. "because" acts as a connector, and the verb of the clause becomes the main dependency within that part.

By following these steps and paying attention to the specified output format, we can arrive at the correct dependency tree and average distance, even if we don't understand the sentence's meaning deeply (as in the hypothetical case of it being in Swedish and the analyzer not knowing Swedish). The focus shifts to structural relationships.
Here's the dependency tree analysis for the given sentence, following the requested format:

```
[(1, An, 3), (2, academic, 3), (3, benchmark, 7), (4, case, 3), (5, (, 7), (6, Unsteady, 7), (7, Aerodynamics, 8), (8, Experiment, 4), (9, Phase, 8), (10, III, 9), (11, ), 7), (12, was, 13), (13, selected, 0), (14, as, 13), (15, a, 17), (16, starting, 17), (17, point, 14), (18, of, 17), (19, the, 20), (20, optimization, 18), (21, because, 13), (22, wind, 23), (23, tunnel, 24), (24, data, 26), (25, was, 26), (26, available, 21), (27, for, 26), (28, that, 29), (29, campain, 27), (30, . , 13)]
```

**Explanation of Dependencies:**

**Average Dependency Distance Calculation:**

To calculate the average dependency distance, we sum the absolute differences between the token index and its head index and then divide by the total number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens minus 1, as the root has no head).

| Token Index | Head Index | Distance |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3 | 2 |
| 2 | 3 | 1 |
| 3 | 7 | 4 |
| 4 | 3 | 1 |
| 5 | 7 | 2 |
| 6 | 7 | 1 |
| 7 | 8 | 1 |
| 8 | 4 | 4 |
| 9 | 8 | 1 |
| 10 | 9 | 1 |
| 11 | 7 | 4 |
| 12 | 13 | 1 |
| 13 | 0 | - |
| 14 | 13 | 1 |
| 15 | 17 | 2 |
| 16 | 17 | 1 |
| 17 | 14 | 3 |
| 18 | 17 | 1 |
| 19 | 20 | 1 |
| 20 | 18 | 2 |
| 21 | 13 | 8 |
| 22 | 23 | 1 |
| 23 | 24 | 1 |
| 24 | 26 | 2 |
| 25 | 26 | 1 |
| 26 | 21 | 5 |
| 27 | 26 | 1 |
| 28 | 29 | 1 |
| 29 | 27 | 2 |
| 30 | 13 | 17 |
| **Total Distance:** |  | 74 |

**Average Dependency Distance = Total Distance / Number of Dependencies**

Number of Dependencies = 30 - 1 = 29

Average Dependency Distance = 74 / 29 ≈ **2.55**
