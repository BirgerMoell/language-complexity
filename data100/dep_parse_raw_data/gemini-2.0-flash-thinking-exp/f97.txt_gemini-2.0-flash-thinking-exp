Here's a breakdown of the thought process to arrive at the dependency tree and average distance:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The primary goal is to create a dependency tree for the Swedish sentence and calculate the average dependency distance. This involves identifying the head-dependent relationships between words.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break down the sentence into individual tokens. This is relatively straightforward, but requires careful attention to punctuation. Each comma, quotation mark, and period needs to be its own token.

   *De* *storlekar* *som* *finns* *är* *15"* *,* *17"* *,* *19"* *och* *21"* *på* *de* *vanliga* *skärmarna* *12"* *,* *15"* *,* *17"* *,* *och* *18"* *på* *de* *platta* *skärmarna* *.

3. **Dependency Parsing (The Core Task):** This is the most complex step. We need to determine the grammatical relationships between the tokens. Here's a thought process for assigning heads:

   * **Start with the Main Verb:**  Sentences often revolve around a main verb. In this case, "är" (is) appears to be the main verb connecting the subject and the description. So, most likely, many other words will depend on "är".

   * **Identify Subjects and Objects:** What *is* being described? "De storlekar som finns" appears to be the subject. "Storlekar" is the noun, and "de" modifies it. "Som finns" is a relative clause modifying "storlekar". "Finns" (exist) depends on "storlekar".

   * **Handle Prepositional Phrases:**  The phrases starting with "på" are prepositional phrases. Prepositions govern nouns. "På" governs "de vanliga skärmarna" and "de platta skärmarna". "Skärmarna" is the core noun in both. "Vanliga" and "platta" modify "skärmarna".

   * **Coordinate Conjunctions:** "Och" (and) connects similar elements. Here, it connects the sizes. The typical structure is that the later element depends on the earlier one in a list. So, "17"", "19"", and "21"" depend on "15"" when describing sizes in the first part. Similarly for the second part.

   * **Appositives/Clarifications:** The second part of the sentence ("12"", 15"", 17"", och 18"" på de platta skärmarna") provides further detail about the sizes. It seems to be connected to "är".

   * **Iterative Refinement:** As you go, you might realize a connection isn't quite right. For example, initially, you might think "15"" depends on "är" directly. But it's more accurate to see it as part of the descriptive element connected by "är". The sizes are *what* the "storlekar" are.

   * **Consider Word Order:** Swedish word order often helps with dependency parsing. Modifiers usually precede the nouns they modify.

   * **Punctuation:** Punctuation often attaches to the word it relates to most closely. Commas usually separate items in a list or clauses. The period marks the end of the sentence and often attaches to the main verb.

4. **Construct the Dependency Tree (List of Triples):**  Once the head-dependent relationships are identified, represent them as triples: `(dependent_index, dependent_token, head_index)`. Carefully track the token indices.

5. **Calculate Dependency Distances:** For each triple, calculate the absolute difference between the head index and the dependent index: `abs(head_index - dependent_index)`.

6. **Calculate Average Dependency Distance:** Sum all the individual dependency distances and divide by the total number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens minus one, excluding the root).

7. **Verification (Self-Correction):** Review the tree. Does it make grammatical sense? Are there any obvious errors?  For instance, are all the prepositional phrases correctly attached? Is the main verb acting as the root?

**Example of a Micro-Decision During Parsing:**

Consider "de vanliga skärmarna".

* "Skärmarna" is the noun.
* "Vanliga" is an adjective modifying "skärmarna". So, "vanliga" depends on "skärmarna".
* "De" is a determiner specifying "skärmarna". So, "de" depends on "skärmarna".

**Applying the Process to the Given Sentence:**

By following these steps carefully, analyzing each word's function and its relationship to other words, we arrive at the provided dependency tree. The process is iterative and requires linguistic understanding. The confidence in the result grows as you successfully connect more and more elements. Ambiguities can arise, and in those cases, linguistic principles and common parsing conventions are used to make the most likely connection.

* **(29, ., 5):** The full stop at index 29 is typically attached to the root of the sentence, which is "är" at index 5.

**Average Dependency Distance:**

The average dependency distance is calculated by summing the absolute differences between the head and dependent indices for each dependency and dividing by the total number of dependencies. In this case, it is approximately **3.1379310344827587**.

**Important Note:**

This dependency tree is constructed based on a common understanding of Swedish grammar. Different dependency parsing algorithms or linguistic theories might produce slightly different trees. For a real-world application, you would typically use a dedicated natural language processing library with a pre-trained Swedish dependency parser. This manual construction is for illustrative purposes.
