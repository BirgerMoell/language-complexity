Here's a breakdown of the thought process to arrive at the dependency tree and average dependency distance for the given Swedish sentence:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The primary goal is to create a dependency tree and calculate the average dependency distance for a *Swedish* sentence. The provided example is a *Swedish* sentence. However, the input sentence is in *English*. This is a critical point and needs correction. I should assume the *input* sentence needs to be treated as the sentence to analyze, despite the example being Swedish.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break down the sentence into individual tokens. This includes words and punctuation.

   "Rising costs of energy, combined with an increasing environmental consciousness on the part of building owners, render timely the law on certification of buildings for energy efficiency."

   Tokens: `Rising`, `costs`, `of`, `energy`, `,`, `combined`, `with`, `an`, `increasing`, `environmental`, `consciousness`, `on`, `the`, `part`, `of`, `building`, `owners`, `,`, `render`, `timely`, `the`, `law`, `on`, `certification`, `of`, `buildings`, `for`, `energy`, `efficiency`, `.`

3. **Dependency Parsing (Conceptual):** Now comes the core task: figuring out the head-dependent relationships. This involves understanding the grammatical function of each word. I'll process the sentence roughly from left to right, identifying the main verb and then relating other words to it.

   * **Main Verb:**  The main verb appears to be "render".

   * **Subject:** What is doing the rendering?  The long noun phrase "Rising costs of energy, combined with an increasing environmental consciousness on the part of building owners".

   * **Object/Complement:** What is being rendered?  "the law on certification of buildings for energy efficiency".

   * **Adverbial Modifiers:**  "timely" modifies "render", indicating *when* or *how* the rendering happens. The phrases connected by "of" and "with" modify the nouns they follow.

4. **Building the Dependency Tree (Triples):**  Representing the dependencies as triples (dependent_index, dependent_word, head_index). I'll assign indices starting from 1.

   * `costs` is modified by `Rising`: `(1, Rising, 2)`
   * `render` is the root: `(19, render, 0)`
   * `costs` is the core of the subject: `(2, costs, 19)`
   * `of` connects `costs` and `energy`: `(3, of, 2)`
   * `energy` modifies `costs` (or is connected by 'of'): `(4, energy, 3)`
   * `,` separates phrases: `(5, ,, 2)` (connects to the main subject noun)
   * `combined` modifies `costs`: `(6, combined, 2)`
   * `with` connects `combined` and `consciousness`: `(7, with, 6)`
   * `an` modifies `consciousness`: `(8, an, 11)`
   * `increasing` modifies `consciousness`: `(9, increasing, 11)`
   * `environmental` modifies `consciousness`: `(10, environmental, 11)`
   * `consciousness` is linked by `with`: `(11, consciousness, 7)`
   * `on` connects `consciousness` and `part`: `(12, on, 11)`
   * `the` modifies `part`: `(13, the, 14)`
   * `part` is linked by `on`: `(14, part, 12)`
   * `of` connects `part` and `owners`: `(15, of, 14)`
   * `building` modifies `owners`: `(16, building, 17)`
   * `owners` is linked by `of`: `(17, owners, 15)`
   * `,` separates clauses: `(18, ,, 19)`
   * `timely` modifies `render`: `(20, timely, 19)`
   * `the` modifies `law`: `(21, the, 22)`
   * `law` is the direct object: `(22, law, 19)`
   * `on` connects `law` and `certification`: `(23, on, 22)`
   * `certification` modifies `law`: `(24, certification, 23)`
   * `of` connects `certification` and `buildings`: `(25, of, 24)`
   * `buildings` modifies `certification`: `(26, buildings, 25)`
   * `for` connects `certification` and `efficiency`: `(27, for, 24)`
   * `energy` modifies `efficiency`: `(28, energy, 29)`
   * `efficiency` is linked by `for`: `(29, efficiency, 27)`
   * `.` ends the sentence: `(30, ., 19)` (can be attached to the root).

5. **Verification and Refinement:** I mentally check the dependencies. Does each arrow make sense grammatically? Are the head-dependent relationships logical?  For example, "Rising" clearly modifies "costs." "of energy" further specifies the kind of costs.

6. **Calculate Dependency Distances:**  For each triple, the dependency distance is the absolute difference between the head index and the dependent index.

   * |1 - 2| = 1
   * |2 - 19| = 17
   * |3 - 2| = 1
   * |4 - 3| = 1
   * |5 - 2| = 3
   * |6 - 2| = 4
   * |7 - 6| = 1
   * |8 - 11| = 3
   * |9 - 11| = 2
   * |10 - 11| = 1
   * |11 - 7| = 4
   * |12 - 11| = 1
   * |13 - 14| = 1
   * |14 - 12| = 2
   * |15 - 14| = 1
   * |16 - 17| = 1
   * |17 - 15| = 2
   * |18 - 19| = 1
   * |20 - 19| = 1
   * |21 - 22| = 1
   * |22 - 19| = 3
   * |23 - 22| = 1
   * |24 - 23| = 1
   * |25 - 24| = 1
   * |26 - 25| = 1
   * |27 - 24| = 3
   * |28 - 29| = 1
   * |29 - 27| = 2
   * |30 - 19| = 11

7. **Compute Average:** Sum the distances and divide by the number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens minus 1, since the root has no head). Sum of distances = 75. Number of dependencies = 30 - 1 = 29. Average = 75 / 29 ≈ 2.586.

8. **Final Output Formatting:**  Ensure the output matches the requested format.

This detailed breakdown reflects the logical steps involved, even highlighting the initial misunderstanding about the language of the input sentence. It's crucial in NLP tasks to pay close attention to the input and desired output formats.
Here's the dependency tree for the English sentence provided, along with the average dependency distance:

**Dependency Tree:**

```

**Average Dependency Distance:**

To calculate the average dependency distance, we sum the absolute differences between the head and dependent indices for each token and then divide by the total number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens minus 1, as the root has no head).

| Dependent | Head | Distance |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2 | 1 |
| 2 | 19 | 17 |
| 3 | 2 | 1 |
| 4 | 3 | 1 |
| 5 | 2 | 3 |
| 6 | 2 | 4 |
| 7 | 6 | 1 |
| 8 | 11 | 3 |
| 9 | 11 | 2 |
| 10 | 11 | 1 |
| 11 | 7 | 4 |
| 12 | 11 | 1 |
| 13 | 14 | 1 |
| 14 | 12 | 2 |
| 15 | 14 | 1 |
| 16 | 17 | 1 |
| 17 | 15 | 2 |
| 18 | 19 | 1 |
| 20 | 19 | 1 |
| 21 | 22 | 1 |
| 22 | 19 | 3 |
| 23 | 22 | 1 |
| 24 | 23 | 1 |
| 25 | 24 | 1 |
| 26 | 25 | 1 |
| 27 | 24 | 3 |
| 28 | 29 | 1 |
| 29 | 27 | 2 |
| 30 | 19 | 11 |
| **Total Distance:** | | **75** |

**Number of Dependencies:** 30 - 1 = 29

**Average Dependency Distance:** 75 / 29 ≈ **2.59**
