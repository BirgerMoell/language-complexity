Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence and create the dependency tree:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The request asks for a dependency tree of a Swedish sentence, following a specific output format, and then to calculate the average dependency distance.

2. **Tokenization:**  The first step is to break the sentence into individual tokens. This involves identifying word boundaries and treating punctuation as separate tokens.

   *  "Ledarna"
   *  "började"
   *  "få"
   *  "smak"
   *  "på"
   *  "att"
   *  "utvidga"
   *  "sitt"
   *  "lands"
   *  "möjligheter"
   *  "och"
   *  "ville"
   *  "inte"
   *  "bara"
   *  "öka"
   *  "landets"
   *  "ekonomiska"
   *  "tillväxt"
   *  "utan"
   *  "även"
   *  "rikets"
   *  "gränser"
   *  "."

3. **Dependency Parsing (the core challenge):** This is where linguistic knowledge comes in. We need to figure out the grammatical relationships between the tokens. This is an iterative process, and sometimes you might revise earlier decisions.

   * **Start with the main verb:**  Look for the verb that seems to be the core action of the main clause. Here, "började" (began) is a good candidate.

   * **Identify the subject:** Who or what began? "Ledarna" (the leaders). So, "Ledarna" depends on "började".

   * **Handle auxiliary verbs and infinitives:** "få" (to get) is an infinitive dependent on "började".

   * **Identify objects and complements:** What did they begin to get? "smak" (taste). "smak" depends on "få".

   * **Prepositional phrases:** "på att utvidga..." (of expanding...). "på" is a preposition governing the infinitive phrase. "på" depends on "smak".

   * **Infinitive phrases:** "att utvidga..."  "utvidga" (to expand) depends on "på".

   * **Possessives and Determiners:** "sitt lands möjligheter" (their country's opportunities). "sitt" (their) modifies "lands", and "lands" modifies "möjligheter".

   * **Conjunctions and parallel structures:** "och ville..." (and wanted...). "ville" is another main verb, coordinated with "började" by "och".

   * **Negation and adverbs:** "inte bara öka..." (not only increase...). "inte" and "bara" modify "öka".

   * **Objects of the second verb:** What did they want to increase? "landets ekonomiska tillväxt" (the country's economic growth).

   * **More conjunctions and parallel structures:** "...utan även rikets gränser" (...but also the realm's borders). "utan" coordinates the two infinitive phrases. "även" modifies the second infinitive.

   * **Possessives and adjectives:** "landets ekonomiska tillväxt" and "rikets gränser". "landets" and "rikets" are possessive forms modifying the nouns. "ekonomiska" modifies "tillväxt".

   * **Punctuation:** The period at the end typically attaches to the main verb of the sentence.

4. **Assign Head Indices:** Once the dependencies are identified, assign the head indices. Remember the root of the sentence (usually the main verb) has a head index of 0.

5. **Format the Output:**  Create the list of tuples in the specified format: `(token_index, token, head_index)`. Pay close attention to the indexing, starting from 1.

6. **Calculate Average Dependency Distance:**

   * **Dependency Distance:** For each dependency, calculate the absolute difference between the head token's index and the dependent token's index.
   * **Sum the Distances:** Add up all the individual dependency distances.
   * **Divide by the Number of Dependencies:** Divide the sum by the total number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens minus 1, excluding the root).

7. **Review and Refine:**  Go back over the dependency tree and make sure it makes grammatical sense. Consider alternative parses if something feels off. For example, are there any ambiguities in the sentence structure? In this case, the structure is relatively clear.

**Self-Correction Example During the Process:**

Initially, I might have considered "få" as the main verb and "började" as an auxiliary. However,  "började" dictates the tense and the overall action (beginning), making it the more likely root. "få" acts as the infinitive dependent on that beginning action. Similarly, when handling the "och" conjunction, recognizing that it connects the two main verbs "började" and "ville" is crucial for correctly attaching the subsequent clauses.

By following these steps, systematically breaking down the sentence, and applying knowledge of Swedish grammar, the dependency tree and the average dependency distance can be accurately generated.
```
[(1, Ledarna, 2), (2, började, 0), (3, få, 2), (4, smak, 3), (5, på, 4), (6, att, 5), (7, utvidga, 6), (8, sitt, 9), (9, lands, 10), (10, möjligheter, 7), (11, och, 12), (12, ville, 2), (13, inte, 15), (14, bara, 15), (15, öka, 12), (16, landets, 18), (17, ekonomiska, 18), (18, tillväxt, 15), (19, utan, 20), (20, även, 21), (21, rikets, 22), (22, gränser, 15), (23, ., 2)]
```

**Dependency Distances:**

* 1 -> 2: |1 - 2| = 1
* 3 -> 2: |3 - 2| = 1
* 4 -> 3: |4 - 3| = 1
* 5 -> 4: |5 - 4| = 1
* 6 -> 5: |6 - 5| = 1
* 7 -> 6: |7 - 6| = 1
* 8 -> 9: |8 - 9| = 1
* 9 -> 10: |9 - 10| = 1
* 10 -> 7: |10 - 7| = 3
* 11 -> 12: |11 - 12| = 1
* 12 -> 2: |12 - 2| = 10
* 13 -> 15: |13 - 15| = 2
* 14 -> 15: |14 - 15| = 1
* 15 -> 12: |15 - 12| = 3
* 16 -> 18: |16 - 18| = 2
* 17 -> 18: |17 - 18| = 1
* 18 -> 15: |18 - 15| = 3
* 19 -> 20: |19 - 20| = 1
* 20 -> 21: |20 - 21| = 1
* 21 -> 22: |21 - 22| = 1
* 22 -> 15: |22 - 15| = 7
* 23 -> 2: |23 - 2| = 21

**Sum of Dependency Distances:** 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 7 + 21 = 65

**Number of Dependencies:** 23 (number of tokens excluding the root which has a head of 0)

**Average Dependency Distance:** 65 / 23 ≈ 2.83

**Therefore, the average dependency distance for the sentence is approximately 2.83.**
