Here's a breakdown of the thought process to arrive at the dependency tree and average dependency distance:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The request asks for a dependency tree representation of a Swedish sentence and the calculation of the average dependency distance. The specific output format for the tree is also provided.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence down into individual tokens. This is fairly straightforward. We need to be mindful of punctuation.

   * "Simuleringsresultatet"
   * "från"
   * "den"
   * "elektriska"
   * "modellen"
   * "jämfördes"
   * "med"
   * "ett"
   * "resultat"
   * "som"
   * "togs"
   * "fram"
   * "från"
   * "en"
   * "Simulink"
   * "modell"
   * "."

3. **Dependency Parsing (the Core Task):**  This is the most complex part and requires linguistic knowledge of Swedish grammar. We need to determine the head-dependent relationships between the tokens. It's helpful to think about the sentence's structure and the function of each word.

   * **Start with the main verb:**  The verb "jämfördes" (was compared) is the central element. It's the root of the sentence. So, its head is 0.

   * **Identify subjects and objects:**  What was compared? "Simuleringsresultatet" (the simulation result). This is the subject and depends on the verb.

   * **Handle prepositional phrases:** "från den elektriska modellen" (from the electric model). "från" is a preposition. The object of the preposition is "modellen". "den" and "elektriska" modify "modellen".

   * **Address conjunctions and relative clauses:** "med ett resultat som togs fram från en Simulink modell" (with a result that was produced from a Simulink model). "med" is a preposition. Its object is "resultat".

   * **Analyze relative clauses:** "som togs fram från en Simulink modell". "som" (that/which) is a relative pronoun, relating back to "resultat". The verb in this clause is "togs fram" (was produced). "togs" is the main verb here, and "fram" is an adverbial particle. What was produced?  The implicit subject refers back to "resultat". "från en Simulink modell" is a prepositional phrase modifying "togs fram", similar to the earlier example.

   * **Work systematically:**  Go through the tokens one by one and determine their head. It's often helpful to visualize the relationships.

4. **Construct the Dependency Tree (following the specified format):** Once the head-dependent relationships are identified, format them according to the given structure: `(token_index, token, head_index)`.

   * (1, Simuleringsresultatet, 6)
   * (2, från, 1)
   * (3, den, 5)
   * (4, elektriska, 5)
   * (5, modellen, 2)
   * (6, jämfördes, 0)
   * (7, med, 6)
   * (8, ett, 9)
   * (9, resultat, 7)
   * (10, som, 11)
   * (11, togs, 9)
   * (12, fram, 11)
   * (13, från, 11)
   * (14, en, 16)
   * (15, Simulink, 16)
   * (16, modell, 13)
   * (17, ., 6)

5. **Calculate Dependency Distances:** For each dependency, calculate the absolute difference between the head index and the dependent index.

   * |6 - 1| = 5
   * |1 - 2| = 1
   * |5 - 3| = 2
   * |5 - 4| = 1
   * |2 - 5| = 3
   * |0 - 6| = 6
   * |6 - 7| = 1
   * |9 - 8| = 1
   * |7 - 9| = 2
   * |11 - 10| = 1
   * |9 - 11| = 2
   * |11 - 12| = 1
   * |11 - 13| = 2
   * |16 - 14| = 2
   * |16 - 15| = 1
   * |13 - 16| = 3
   * |6 - 17| = 1

6. **Calculate Average Dependency Distance:** Sum the dependency distances and divide by the total number of dependencies. The number of dependencies is the number of tokens minus the root (or simply the number of non-zero head indices).

   * Total distance = 5 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 32
   * Number of dependencies = 17
   * Average distance = 32 / 17 ≈ 1.88

7. **Final Output:** Present the dependency tree and the average dependency distance clearly, as requested in the prompt.
```
[(1, Simuleringsresultatet, 6), (2, från, 1), (3, den, 5), (4, elektriska, 5), (5, modellen, 2), (6, jämfördes, 0), (7, med, 6), (8, ett, 9), (9, resultat, 7), (10, som, 11), (11, togs, 9), (12, fram, 11), (13, från, 11), (14, en, 16), (15, Simulink, 16), (16, modell, 13), (17, ., 6)]
```

**Explanation of the Dependency Tree:**

* **(1, Simuleringsresultatet, 6):** "Simuleringsresultatet" (The simulation result) is the subject and depends on the main verb "jämfördes".
* **(2, från, 1):** "från" (from) is a preposition modifying "Simuleringsresultatet".
* **(3, den, 5):** "den" (the) is a determiner modifying "modellen".
* **(4, elektriska, 5):** "elektriska" (electric) is an adjective modifying "modellen".
* **(5, modellen, 2):** "modellen" (the model) is the object of the preposition "från".
* **(6, jämfördes, 0):** "jämfördes" (was compared) is the main verb and the root of the sentence (head is 0).
* **(7, med, 6):** "med" (with) is a preposition modifying the verb "jämfördes".
* **(8, ett, 9):** "ett" (a) is a determiner modifying "resultat".
* **(9, resultat, 7):** "resultat" (result) is the object of the preposition "med".
* **(10, som, 11):** "som" (that/which) is a relative pronoun and the subject of the relative clause. It refers back to "resultat".
* **(11, togs, 9):** "togs" (was taken/produced) is the verb in the relative clause and depends on "resultat".
* **(12, fram, 11):** "fram" (out/forth) is a particle belonging to the verb "togs".
* **(13, från, 11):** "från" (from) is a preposition modifying the verb "togs".
* **(14, en, 16):** "en" (a) is a determiner modifying "modell".
* **(15, Simulink, 16):** "Simulink" is an adjective modifying "modell".
* **(16, modell, 13):** "modell" (model) is the object of the preposition "från" within the relative clause.
* **(17, ., 6):** The full stop depends on the main verb.

**Calculation of Average Dependency Distance:**

To calculate the average dependency distance, we sum the absolute differences between the head and dependent indices for each dependency and then divide by the total number of dependencies.

* |6 - 1| = 5
* |1 - 2| = 1
* |5 - 3| = 2
* |5 - 4| = 1
* |2 - 5| = 3
* |0 - 6| = 6
* |6 - 7| = 1
* |9 - 8| = 1
* |7 - 9| = 2
* |11 - 10| = 1
* |9 - 11| = 2
* |11 - 12| = 1
* |11 - 13| = 2
* |16 - 14| = 2
* |16 - 15| = 1
* |13 - 16| = 3
* |6 - 17| = 1

**Sum of distances = 5 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 32**

**Number of dependencies = 17**

**Average dependency distance = 32 / 17 ≈ 1.88**

Therefore, the average dependency distance for the sentence is approximately **1.88**.
