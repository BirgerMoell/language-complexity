Here's a breakdown of the thought process to arrive at the dependency tree and average dependency distance:

1. **Understand the Request:** The core task is to create a dependency tree representation of a Swedish sentence. Key constraints are the output format (triples with token index, token, and head index) and the inclusion of punctuation as tokens. Additionally, the average dependency distance needs to be calculated.

2. **Tokenization:**  The first step is to break down the sentence into individual tokens. This includes words and punctuation.

   * "Många"
   * "afrikanska"
   * "regeringar"
   * "vill"
   * "helt"
   * "enkelt"
   * "inte"
   * "erkänna"
   * "att"
   * "HIV/AIDS"
   * "är"
   * "ett"
   * "stort"
   * "problem"
   * ","
   * "trots"
   * "att"
   * "miljoner"
   * "dör"
   * "i"
   * "landet"
   * "."

3. **Dependency Parsing (Manual - Heuristic Approach):** Since we're not using an automated parser, we need to determine the head of each token based on grammatical relationships. This involves understanding Swedish grammar. This is the most complex step and requires some linguistic knowledge.

   * **Start with the main verb:** The sentence seems to have two clauses. Let's identify the main verbs in each: "vill" and "dör". The root of the main clause is likely "vill".

   * **Analyze the main clause:**  "Många afrikanska regeringar vill..."

     * "regeringar" is the subject performing the action of "vill". So, "regeringar" is dependent on "vill".
     * "Många" modifies "regeringar".
     * "afrikanska" modifies "regeringar".
     * "helt enkelt" modifies "vill". "enkelt" likely modifies "helt".
     * "inte" modifies "vill".
     * "erkänna" is what they don't want to do. It's the infinitive complement of "vill".

   * **Analyze the subordinate clause:** "...trots att miljoner dör i landet."

     * "dör" is the main verb of this clause.
     * "miljoner" is the subject performing the action "dör".
     * "i" is a preposition.
     * "landet" is the object of the preposition "i".
     * "trots att" introduces the subordinate clause. "att" is a subordinator, depending on "trots".

   * **Analyze the embedded clause within the main clause:** "...att HIV/AIDS är ett stort problem..."

     * "är" is the copular verb.
     * "HIV/AIDS" is the subject of "är".
     * "problem" is the predicative complement of "är".
     * "ett" is a determiner modifying "problem".
     * "stort" is an adjective modifying "problem".
     * "att" acts as a complementizer making this a subordinate clause embedded within the main clause's object ("erkänna").

   * **Connect the clauses:** The "att" before "HIV/AIDS" is dependent on "erkänna". The comma separates the clauses and is likely dependent on the main verb of the second clause, "dör".

   * **Final punctuation:** The period likely attaches to the main root verb.

4. **Assign Head Indices:** Based on the dependency relationships determined above, assign the head index for each token. Remember the root of the sentence gets a head index of 0. Iterate through the tokens and assign the index of its head.

   * Example: "Många" modifies "regeringar" (index 3), so the head index for "Många" is 3.

5. **Construct the Dependency Tree (List of Triples):**  Format the output according to the specified format: `(token_index, token, head_index)`. Ensure the token indices are sequential starting from 1.

6. **Calculate Dependency Distances:**

   * Iterate through the dependency tree triples.
   * For each triple `(i, token, head_index)`, the dependency distance is the absolute difference between `i` and `head_index`.
   * Sum up all the dependency distances.

7. **Calculate Average Dependency Distance:**

   * Divide the total dependency distance by the number of dependency relations (which is the number of tokens minus one, since the root has no head). In this case, 22 tokens - 1 = 21 relations.

8. **Review and Refine:** Double-check the dependency relationships and calculations. Are there any ambiguities?  Does the structure make grammatical sense?  For example,  making sure the comma connects the two main clauses is a decision point. Consider alternative interpretations if unsure, but choose the most likely based on grammatical principles.

This systematic approach allows for a structured way to create the dependency tree and calculate the average dependency distance even without an automated parser. The key is understanding grammatical relationships and applying them consistently.
Here's the dependency tree for the Swedish sentence "Många afrikanska regeringar vill helt enkelt inte erkänna att HIV/AIDS är ett stort problem, trots att miljoner dör i landet." along with the average dependency distance:

**Dependency Tree:**

[(1, Många, 3), (2, afrikanska, 3), (3, regeringar, 4), (4, vill, 0), (5, helt, 6), (6, enkelt, 4), (7, inte, 4), (8, erkänna, 4), (9, att, 11), (10, HIV/AIDS, 11), (11, är, 8), (12, ett, 14), (13, stort, 14), (14, problem, 11), (15, ,, 19), (16, trots, 19), (17, att, 19), (18, miljoner, 19), (19, dör, 4), (20, i, 19), (21, landet, 20), (22, ., 4)]

**Explanation of Dependencies:**

* **4 (vill)** is the root of the main clause.
* **3 (regeringar)** is the subject of "vill".
* **1 (Många)** modifies "regeringar".
* **2 (afrikanska)** modifies "regeringar".
* **6 (enkelt)** modifies "vill".
* **5 (helt)** modifies "enkelt".
* **7 (inte)** modifies "vill".
* **8 (erkänna)** is the infinitive complement of "vill".
* **11 (är)** is the verb in the embedded clause that "erkänna" governs.
* **9 (att)** introduces the embedded clause.
* **10 (HIV/AIDS)** is the subject of "är".
* **14 (problem)** is the predicative complement of "är".
* **12 (ett)** is a determiner for "problem".
* **13 (stort)** modifies "problem".
* **15 (, )** is a punctuation mark likely attached to the main verb of the following clause.
* **19 (dör)** is the main verb of the second clause.
* **16 (trots)** introduces the adverbial clause.
* **17 (att)** introduces the clause following "trots".
* **18 (miljoner)** is the subject of "dör".
* **20 (i)** is a preposition.
* **21 (landet)** is the object of the preposition "i".
* **22 (.)** is the sentence-ending punctuation, attached to the root.

**Calculating Average Dependency Distance:**

To calculate the average dependency distance, we sum the absolute difference between the token index and its head index for each token (excluding the root, which has a head index of 0) and then divide by the total number of dependencies.

| Token Index | Head Index | Distance |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3 | 2 |
| 2 | 3 | 1 |
| 3 | 4 | 1 |
| 5 | 6 | 1 |
| 6 | 4 | 2 |
| 7 | 4 | 3 |
| 8 | 4 | 4 |
| 9 | 11 | 2 |
| 10 | 11 | 1 |
| 11 | 8 | 3 |
| 12 | 14 | 2 |
| 13 | 14 | 1 |
| 14 | 11 | 3 |
| 15 | 19 | 4 |
| 16 | 19 | 3 |
| 17 | 19 | 2 |
| 18 | 19 | 1 |
| 19 | 4 | 15 |
| 20 | 19 | 1 |
| 21 | 20 | 1 |
| 22 | 4 | 18 |
| **Total Distance** |  | **71** |

**Average Dependency Distance = Total Distance / Number of Dependencies**

Average Dependency Distance = 71 / 21 ≈ **3.38**

Therefore, the average dependency distance for the sentence is approximately **3.38**.
