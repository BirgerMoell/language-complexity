Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence and generate the dependency tree:

1. **Understanding the Request:** The core task is dependency parsing of a Swedish sentence. The output format is specified: `(token_index, token, head_index)`. Punctuation should be included as tokens. The average dependency distance also needs to be calculated.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence down into individual tokens. This is fairly straightforward for this sentence:

   * Under
   * kriget
   * skulle
   * samlingsregeringen
   * flera
   * gånger
   * komma
   * att
   * bryta
   * mot
   * neutraliteten
   * ,
   * både
   * till
   * de
   * Allierades
   * och
   * Axelmakternas
   * fördel
   * .

3. **Dependency Analysis (Core Logic):** This is the most complex part. The goal is to identify the head of each token. This involves understanding the grammatical relationships between words. A good starting point is to identify the main verb. In this sentence, "skulle komma att bryta" functions as a verbal complex, with "bryta" being the main action.

4. **Finding the Root:** The root of the dependency tree is typically the main verb. In this case, "bryta" is the central action. Therefore, its head will be 0.

5. **Identifying Dependencies (Iterative Process):**  Now, work through the sentence, considering each token and how it relates to other tokens:

   * **"Under kriget"**:  "Under" is a preposition modifying the verb "bryta," specifying *when* the breaking happened. "kriget" is the object of the preposition "under."
   * **"skulle komma att"**: These are auxiliary verbs forming a future tense construction around "bryta." They modify "bryta."  "Skulle" is the main auxiliary. "komma" depends on "skulle," and "att" further depends on "komma" (forming the infinitive marker).
   * **"samlingsregeringen"**: This is the subject performing the action of "bryta."
   * **"flera gånger"**: This adverbial phrase modifies "bryta," indicating *how often* the breaking occurred. "Gånger" is the head, and "flera" modifies it.
   * **"mot neutraliteten"**: This prepositional phrase modifies "bryta," indicating *what* was broken. "Neutraliteten" is the object of "mot."
   * **","**: Punctuation usually attaches to the main clause verb.
   * **"både till de Allierades och Axelmakternas fördel"**: This complex phrase indicates *for whose benefit* the neutrality was broken. "Både" acts as a coordinator. "till fördel" is a prepositional phrase. "De Allierades" and "Axelmakternas" are the objects of "till" and are coordinated by "och." "Fördel" is the head of the phrase. Consider how "både...och" structures the connection.
   * **"."**:  Attaches to the main verb.

6. **Assigning Head Indices:** As the dependencies are identified, assign the head indices based on the token indices. Carefully count the tokens.

7. **Constructing the Triples:**  Format the identified dependencies into the specified `(token_index, token, head_index)` triples. Double-check the indices to ensure they are correct.

8. **Calculating Average Dependency Distance:**
   * Calculate the dependency distance for each token: `abs(token_index - head_index)`. Remember that the root has a head index of 0.
   * Sum the distances.
   * Divide the sum by the total number of tokens.

9. **Review and Refine:**  Read through the generated tree and distances. Does it make sense grammatically? Are there any obvious errors in the dependency relationships or indices?  For example, double-check prepositions and their objects, auxiliary verbs, and coordination. This is where careful proofreading is essential. Consider alternative interpretations if unsure, and justify the chosen structure. For example, one might initially think "komma" could be the main verb, but the context strongly suggests the future tense construction with "bryta" as the core action.

This systematic approach, combining linguistic knowledge with careful attention to detail, leads to the correct dependency tree and average dependency distance.

[(1, Under, 9), (2, kriget, 1), (3, skulle, 9), (4, samlingsregeringen, 9), (5, flera, 6), (6, gånger, 9), (7, komma, 9), (8, att, 9), (9, bryta, 0), (10, mot, 9), (11, neutraliteten, 10), (12, ,, 9), (13, både, 19), (14, till, 19), (15, de, 16), (16, Allierades, 14), (17, och, 19), (18, Axelmakternas, 17), (19, fördel, 14), (20, ., 9)]
```

**Average Dependency Distance Calculation:**

1. **Dependency Distances:** Calculate the absolute difference between the token index and its head index for each token:
   - |1 - 9| = 8
   - |2 - 1| = 1
   - |3 - 9| = 6
   - |4 - 9| = 5
   - |5 - 6| = 1
   - |6 - 9| = 3
   - |7 - 9| = 2
   - |8 - 9| = 1
   - |9 - 0| = 9
   - |10 - 9| = 1
   - |11 - 10| = 1
   - |12 - 9| = 3
   - |13 - 19| = 6
   - |14 - 19| = 5
   - |15 - 16| = 1
   - |16 - 14| = 2
   - |17 - 19| = 2
   - |18 - 17| = 1
   - |19 - 14| = 5
   - |20 - 9| = 11

2. **Sum of Distances:** Add up all the dependency distances:
   8 + 1 + 6 + 5 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 9 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 6 + 5 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 11 = 74

3. **Number of Tokens:** Count the total number of tokens (including punctuation): 20

4. **Average Dependency Distance:** Divide the sum of distances by the number of tokens:
   74 / 20 = 3.7

**Therefore, the average dependency distance for the sentence is 3.7.**
