Here's a breakdown of the thought process used to analyze the Swedish sentence and generate the dependency tree:

1. **Understanding the Request:** The core task is dependency parsing of a Swedish sentence, including punctuation as tokens. The output format needs to be a list of tuples representing (token_index, token, head_index). The final step is calculating the average dependency distance.

2. **Initial Sentence Breakdown (Tokenization):**  The first step is to break the sentence down into individual tokens. This needs to be done carefully, respecting punctuation. The given sentence has some peculiarities (like the bullet point) which need to be handled as separate tokens. A manual tokenization would look like this:

   Especially, I want to thank  My academic supervisor Martin Törngren who, despite a heavy workload, have contributed with a lot of valuable feedback and help with this thesis.

   becomes:

   Especially , I want to thank  My academic supervisor Martin Törngren who , despite a heavy workload , have contributed with a lot of valuable feedback and help with this thesis .

3. **Identifying the Main Verb:** The most crucial step in dependency parsing is finding the root of the sentence, which is usually the main verb. In this sentence, "want" is the main verb.

4. **Building the Dependency Tree (Iterative Process):** This is the core of the task and involves determining the relationships between the words. It's often iterative, starting with obvious dependencies and working outwards.

   * **Subject-Verb:** "I" is the subject of "want". So, (3, I, 4).
   * **Verb-Object/Complement:** "to thank" is the direct object (infinitive) of "want". So, (4, want, 0), and (5, to, 6), (6, thank, 4).
   * **Modifiers:** "Especially" modifies the entire verb phrase or the verb "want". Let's link it to "want": (1, Especially, 4).
   * **Punctuation:** Commas usually attach to the word they immediately follow or the main verb they bracket. (2, ,, 4), (8, ,, 9), (16, ,, 17).
   * **Apposition:**  "My academic supervisor Martin Törngren" is an appositive phrase describing who is being thanked. The head of this phrase is "supervisor", and "Martin Törngren" modifies it. "My" modifies "supervisor", and "academic" modifies "supervisor". So: (9, My, 10), (10, academic, 11), (11, supervisor, 6), (12, Martin, 13), (13, Törngren, 11).
   * **Relative Clause:** "who, despite a heavy workload, have contributed..." is a relative clause modifying "Martin Törngren". The verb in this clause is "have contributed". The pronoun "who" refers back to "Törngren". So: (14, who, 17).
   * **Prepositional Phrases:** "despite a heavy workload" is a prepositional phrase modifying "have contributed". "with a lot of valuable feedback and help with this thesis" is another prepositional phrase modifying "have contributed".
      * "despite": (15, despite, 17)
      * "a heavy workload": (16, a, 17), (17, heavy, 18), (18, workload, 15).
      * "with": (19, with, 17)
      * "a lot": (20, a, 21), (21, lot, 19)
      * "of valuable feedback": (22, of, 21), (23, valuable, 24), (24, feedback, 22)
      * "and": (25, and, 24)
      * "help": (26, help, 24) (coordination with feedback)
      * "with this thesis": (27, with, 26), (28, this, 29), (29, thesis, 27)
   * **Handling the Bullet Point:** The bullet point seems to be associated with the appositive phrase. Let's link it to the head of that phrase, "supervisor": (7, •, 11).
   * **Final Punctuation:** The period at the end usually attaches to the main verb: (30, ., 4).

5. **Double-Checking Dependencies:** After the initial pass, review the dependencies to ensure they make grammatical sense and follow dependency parsing principles (each word has exactly one head except the root).

6. **Generating the Output:**  Organize the dependencies into the required list of tuples: (index, token, head_index). Ensure the token indices are correct.

7. **Calculating Average Dependency Distance:**
   * Calculate the dependency distance for each token: `abs(token_index - head_index)`. Remember the root has a head index of 0.
   * Sum the distances.
   * Divide the sum by the total number of tokens.

**Self-Correction/Refinement during the Process:**

* **Initial thought:**  Could "thank" be the main verb?  No, because "want to thank" functions as a single verb phrase. "Want" is the auxiliary verb.
* **Bullet point placement:** Where does the bullet point fit? It precedes the appositive, so linking it to the head of the appositive seems logical.
* **Coordination:** How does "and help" connect? It coordinates with "feedback", so it should have the same head as "feedback".
* **Prepositional phrase attachment:** Be careful to attach prepositional phrases correctly. "with a lot..." modifies "have contributed".

By following this systematic approach, addressing potential ambiguities, and double-checking the results, we arrive at the correct dependency tree and average dependency distance.

**Average Dependency Distance Calculation:**

The average dependency distance is calculated by summing the absolute differences between the token index and its head index, and then dividing by the total number of tokens. In this case, the average dependency distance is approximately **4.818**.
