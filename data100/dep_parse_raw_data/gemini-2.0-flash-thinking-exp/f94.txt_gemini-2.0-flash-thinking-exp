Here's a breakdown of the thought process to arrive at the dependency tree and average dependency distance for the Swedish sentence:

1. **Understanding the Request:** The goal is to analyze a Swedish sentence, create a dependency tree representation, and calculate the average dependency distance. The output format for the dependency tree is specified.

2. **Sentence Analysis (Parsing):**  The first step is to understand the grammatical structure of the sentence. This involves identifying the words, their roles (parts of speech), and how they relate to each other. Even without being a native Swedish speaker, one can leverage general linguistic knowledge and contextual clues.

    * **Initial Scan and Word Segmentation:**  Break the sentence into individual tokens:  "Plankalkül", "hette", "den", "första", "datorns", "som", "gjorde", "i", "Tyskland", "den", "används", "för", "inom", "militären", "."

    * **Identifying the Core Verb:**  The verb "hette" (was called) seems like a central element. What was called Plankalkül? "Den första datorns" (the first computer's).

    * **Identifying the Subject:** "Plankalkül" is clearly the subject of "hette".

    * **Identifying Modifiers and Attributives:**  "första" modifies "datorns".

    * **Handling the "som" Clause:** The relative pronoun "som" introduces a relative clause. "som gjorde i Tyskland" (which was made in Germany). "gjorde" is the verb of this clause, and "datorns" is the antecedent of "som". "i Tyskland" modifies "gjorde".

    * **Identifying the Second Clause:**  "den används för inom militären" (it is used for within the military). Here, "den" likely refers back to "Plankalkül". "används" is the verb. "för inom militären" acts as an adverbial phrase modifying "används". "inom militären" functions as a prepositional phrase.

    * **Addressing the Repeated "den":** It seems there might be a slight grammatical awkwardness or a feature of spoken Swedish here. It appears "den" is used twice, perhaps redundantly. We need to make a choice about its head. Given the meaning, the second "den" is more likely the subject of "används".

    * **Connecting the Clauses:** There's no explicit conjunction connecting the two main clauses. The relationship is one of description/additional information.

3. **Building the Dependency Tree:** Now, translate the parsed structure into the specified dependency tree format. Iterate through each token and determine its head.

    * **Plankalkül:**  The subject of "hette", so its head is "hette". (1, Plankalkül, 2)
    * **hette:** The main verb of the first clause, so its head is the root (0). (2, hette, 0)
    * **den:**  A determiner modifying "datorns". (3, den, 5)
    * **första:**  An adjective modifying "datorns". (4, första, 5)
    * **datorns:**  Part of the subject complement of "hette". (5, datorns, 2)
    * **som:**  A relative pronoun, its head is the verb of its clause, "gjorde". (6, som, 7)
    * **gjorde:** The verb of the relative clause, modifying "datorns". (7, gjorde, 5)
    * **i:**  A preposition modifying "gjorde". (8, i, 7)
    * **Tyskland:** The object of the preposition "i". (9, Tyskland, 8)
    * **den:** The subject of "används". (10, den, 11)
    * **används:** The main verb of the second clause. (11, används, 2)  *Important decision: Connecting this to the main verb "hette" to show the overall structure.*
    * **för:** A preposition modifying "används". (12, för, 11)
    * **inom:** A preposition within the prepositional phrase. (13, inom, 12)
    * **militären:** The object of the preposition "inom". (14, militären, 13)
    * **.:** Punctuation, depends on the overall structure. It can be attached to the main verb. (15, ., 11)

4. **Calculating Dependency Distances:** For each token, find the absolute difference between its index and the index of its head.

    * Plankalkül: |1 - 2| = 1
    * hette: |2 - 0| = 2
    * den: |3 - 5| = 2
    * första: |4 - 5| = 1
    * datorns: |5 - 2| = 3
    * som: |6 - 7| = 1
    * gjorde: |7 - 5| = 2
    * i: |8 - 7| = 1
    * Tyskland: |9 - 8| = 1
    * den: |10 - 11| = 1
    * används: |11 - 2| = 9
    * för: |12 - 11| = 1
    * inom: |13 - 12| = 1
    * militären: |14 - 13| = 1
    * .: |15 - 11| = 4

5. **Calculating Average Dependency Distance:** Sum the individual dependency distances and divide by the total number of dependencies (number of tokens excluding the root connection, or simply the number of tokens if you include the root connection as a dependency). Here, we have 15 tokens.

    Total distance = 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 9 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 31
    Average distance = 31 / 15 ≈ 2.07

6. **Final Output Formatting:** Present the dependency tree and average distance in the requested format.

**Self-Correction/Refinement during the process:**

* **Initial ambiguity with "den":** Recognizing the potential ambiguity of the repeated "den" and making a reasoned decision based on likely grammatical function.
* **Connecting the clauses:** Deciding how to connect the two main clauses in the dependency structure. Connecting the second main verb to the first main verb makes sense to show the overall sentence structure.
* **Punctuation:**  Remembering to include the period as a token and assigning it a head. Attaching it to the main verb of the second clause feels logical.
* **Double-checking indices:** Ensuring the indices in the dependency tree tuples are correct and consistent.
* **Calculation accuracy:** Double-checking the addition of dependency distances and the final division.

**Explanation of the Dependency Tree:**

* **(1, Plankalkül, 2):** The word "Plankalkül" (index 1) is the subject and depends on the verb "hette" (index 2).
* **(2, hette, 0):** The verb "hette" (index 2) is the root of the main clause, indicated by the head index 0.
* **(3, den, 5):** The determiner "den" (index 3) modifies the noun "datorns" (index 5).
* **(4, första, 5):** The adjective "första" (index 4) modifies the noun "datorns" (index 5).
* **(5, datorns, 2):** The noun "datorns" (index 5) is part of the subject complement and depends on the verb "hette" (index 2).
* **(6, som, 7):** The relative pronoun "som" (index 6) introduces a relative clause and depends on the verb "gjorde" (index 7).
* **(7, gjorde, 5):** The verb "gjorde" (index 7) is the verb of the relative clause and modifies "datorns" (index 5).
* **(8, i, 7):** The preposition "i" (index 8) depends on the verb "gjorde" (index 7).
* **(9, Tyskland, 8):** The noun "Tyskland" (index 9) is the object of the preposition "i" (index 8).
* **(10, den, 11):** The pronoun "den" (index 10) is the subject of the second clause and depends on the verb "används" (index 11).
* **(11, används, 2):** The verb "används" (index 11) is the main verb of the second clause. Here, I've connected it to the main verb of the first clause "hette" (index 2) to represent the coordination or connection between the two parts of the sentence.
* **(12, för, 11):** The preposition "för" (index 12) depends on the verb "används" (index 11).
* **(13, inom, 12):** The preposition "inom" (index 13) depends on the preposition "för" (index 12).
* **(14, militären, 13):** The noun "militären" (index 14) is the object of the preposition "inom" (index 13).
* **(15, ., 11):** The punctuation mark "." (index 15) is attached to the main verb of the second clause "används" (index 11).

**Average Dependency Distance:**

The average dependency distance is calculated by summing the absolute differences between the head and dependent indices and dividing by the number of dependencies. In this case, the sum of the distances is:

|1-2| + |2-0| + |3-5| + |4-5| + |5-2| + |6-7| + |7-5| + |8-7| + |9-8| + |10-11| + |11-2| + |12-11| + |13-12| + |14-13| + |15-11|
= 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 9 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4
= 31

Average distance = 31 / 15 = 2.0666... ≈ 2.07
