Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence and generate the dependency tree:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The main tasks are to create a dependency tree representation and calculate the average dependency distance. The specific format for the tree output is given.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence into individual tokens. This is generally straightforward, separating words by spaces and treating punctuation as separate tokens.
   *  "Viruset"
   *  "aktiveras"
   *  "då"
   *  "användaren"
   *  "kör"
   *  "det"
   *  "program"
   *  "som"
   *  "viruset"
   *  "infekterat"
   *  "."

3. **Dependency Parsing (Conceptual):**  This is the core of the task. We need to identify the head of each token. The head is the word that governs or determines the meaning of the dependent word. This often involves understanding grammatical relationships (subject-verb, object-verb, modifier-noun, etc.). It also helps to consider the sentence's structure and meaning. A crucial element is finding the *root* of the sentence, the main verb or predicate.

4. **Identifying the Root:**  The main verb in this sentence is "aktiveras" (is activated). This will be the root of our dependency tree, with a head index of 0.

5. **Analyzing Dependencies (Iterative Process):**  Now, go through each token and determine its head:

   * **Viruset:** What activates? The virus. So, "aktiveras" is the head of "Viruset".
   * **aktiveras:** This is the root, head is 0.
   * **då:** This introduces a temporal clause (when). It modifies the main verb "aktiveras".
   * **användaren:** Who is doing the "kör" (running)? The user. So, "kör" is the head of "användaren".
   * **kör:** This verb is part of the subordinate clause. What does the subordinate clause modify? It explains *when* the virus is activated. Therefore, "aktiveras" is the head of "kör".
   * **det:** What is being run? "det" (it, referring to the program). "program" is the head of "det".
   * **program:** This is the object of the verb "kör".
   * **som:** This is a relative pronoun introducing a relative clause. It refers back to "program". "program" is the head.
   * **viruset:** What infected the program? The virus. "infekterat" is the head.
   * **infekterat:** This verb modifies the noun "program".
   * **.:** Punctuation usually depends on the main verb.

6. **Assigning Head Indices:** Based on the analysis above, assign the numerical index of the head for each token. Remember token indices start from 1.

   * Viruset (1): Head is aktiveras (2) -> 2
   * aktiveras (2): Root -> 0
   * då (3): Head is aktiveras (2) -> 2
   * användaren (4): Head is kör (5) -> 5
   * kör (5): Head is aktiveras (2) -> 2
   * det (6): Head is program (7) -> 7
   * program (7): Head is kör (5) -> 5
   * som (8): Head is program (7) -> 7
   * viruset (9): Head is infekterat (10) -> 10
   * infekterat (10): Head is program (7) -> 7
   * . (11): Head is aktiveras (2) -> 2

7. **Formatting the Output:**  Arrange the information into the specified list of tuples: `(token_index, token, head_index)`.

8. **Calculating Dependency Distances:**

   * For each token, calculate the absolute difference between its index and its head's index.
   * Viruset: |1 - 2| = 1
   * aktiveras: |2 - 0| = 2
   * då: |3 - 2| = 1
   * användaren: |4 - 5| = 1
   * kör: |5 - 2| = 3
   * det: |6 - 7| = 1
   * program: |7 - 5| = 2
   * som: |8 - 7| = 1
   * viruset: |9 - 10| = 1
   * infekterat: |10 - 7| = 3
   * .: |11 - 2| = 9

9. **Calculating Average Distance:** Sum the dependency distances and divide by the number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens excluding the root, or simply the number of tokens if you consider the root to have a distance). In this case, we have 11 tokens.

   * Total distance = 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 9 = 25
   * Average distance = 25 / 11 ≈ 2.27

10. **Final Review:** Double-check the dependency relationships and calculations for accuracy. Ensure the output format matches the requirements.

**Explanation of the Dependency Tree:**

Here's a breakdown of the dependency relationships in the provided output:

* **(1, Viruset, 2):** The noun "Viruset" (The virus) is the subject of the verb "aktiveras".
* **(2, aktiveras, 0):** The verb "aktiveras" (is activated) is the root of the sentence. Its head is 0.
* **(3, då, 2):** The adverb "då" (when) modifies the verb "aktiveras", indicating the time of the action.
* **(4, användaren, 5):** The noun "användaren" (the user) is the subject of the verb "kör".
* **(5, kör, 2):** The verb "kör" (runs) is part of a subordinate clause and depends on the main verb "aktiveras".
* **(6, det, 7):** The pronoun "det" (it) is the determiner/specifier of the noun "program".
* **(7, program, 5):** The noun "program" (program) is the object of the verb "kör".
* **(8, som, 7):** The relative pronoun "som" (that/which) modifies the noun "program".
* **(9, viruset, 10):** The noun "viruset" (the virus) is the subject of the verb "infekterat".
* **(10, infekterat, 7):** The past participle "infekterat" (infected) modifies the noun "program".
* **(11, ., 2):** The full stop punctuates the main clause and depends on the root verb "aktiveras".

**Average Dependency Distance:**

The average dependency distance is calculated as follows:

* **Viruset:** |1 - 2| = 1
* **aktiveras:** |2 - 0| = 2
* **då:** |3 - 2| = 1
* **användaren:** |4 - 5| = 1
* **kör:** |5 - 2| = 3
* **det:** |6 - 7| = 1
* **program:** |7 - 5| = 2
* **som:** |8 - 7| = 1
* **viruset:** |9 - 10| = 1
* **infekterat:** |10 - 7| = 3
* **.:** |11 - 2| = 9

**Total distance = 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 9 = 25**
**Average distance = 25 / 11 ≈ 2.27**
