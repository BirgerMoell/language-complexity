Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence and create the dependency tree:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to create a dependency tree representation of the Swedish sentence and calculate the average dependency distance. The specified output format `[(index, token, head_index)]` needs to be strictly adhered to.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence down into individual tokens. This involves identifying words and punctuation marks. Carefully consider contractions or compound words, but in this case, the sentence is fairly straightforward.

   *Då*
   *ändrade*
   *ordet*
   *hacker*
   *mening*
   *till*
   *att*
   *betyda*
   *ungefär*
   *"En*
   *person*
   *som*
   *arbetar*
   *,*
   *sover*
   *och*
   *lever*
   *med*
   *datorer*
   *"*
   *. *

3. **Assign Token Indices:**  Assign a unique index to each token, starting from 1. This is crucial for referencing tokens in the dependency tree.

   1: Då
   2: ändrade
   3: ordet
   4: hacker
   5: mening
   6: till
   7: att
   8: betyda
   9: ungefär
   10: "En
   11: person
   12: som
   13: arbetar
   14: ,
   15: sover
   16: och
   17: lever
   18: med
   19: datorer
   20: "
   21: .

4. **Dependency Parsing (Manual Approach):** Now, the core of the task is to determine the head of each token. This requires understanding the grammatical relationships between words.

   * **Start with the main verb:**  Identify the central verb of the sentence. In this case, it's "ändrade" (changed). This verb will be the root of the dependency tree and have a head index of 0.

   * **Identify dependents of the main verb:**  Look for words that directly modify or are arguments of "ändrade."
      * "Då" (Then) modifies the timing of the action, so it depends on "ändrade."
      * "ordet hacker mening" (the word hacker meaning) is the subject that performed the action of changing. The most central noun in this phrase is "mening," with "ordet" and "hacker" modifying it.

   * **Process phrases and clauses:** Break down complex parts of the sentence.
      * "till att betyda ungefär..." (to mean approximately...)  "betyda" depends on "till," and "ungefär" modifies "betyda."
      * ""En person som arbetar, sover och lever med datorer"" (A person who works, sleeps and lives with computers). This is a noun phrase providing the meaning. "person" is the main noun. "som" introduces a relative clause. "arbetar," "sover," and "lever" are verbs within the relative clause, coordinated by "och," all modifying "person." "med datorer" modifies "lever." The quotation marks delimit the phrase.

   * **Handle punctuation:** Punctuation often depends on the main verb or the clause it ends.

5. **Construct the Dependency Triples:**  For each token, create a triple: `(index, token, head_index)`.

   * (1, Då, 2)  "Då" depends on "ändrade" (index 2).
   * (2, ändrade, 0) "ändrade" is the root.
   * (3, ordet, 5) "ordet" modifies "mening."
   * (4, hacker, 5) "hacker" modifies "mening."
   * (5, mening, 2) "mening" is the object of "ändrade."
   * (6, till, 2) "till" depends on "ändrade."
   * (7, att, 8) "att" introduces the infinitive clause and depends on "betyda". *Correction needed here, "att" is typically the head and "betyda" the dependent.*  Let's revise. "att" depends on "till".
   * (8, betyda, 6) "betyda" depends on "till". *Correction: "betyda" depends on "att"*. Let's revise.
   * (9, ungefär, 8) "ungefär" modifies "betyda."
   * (10, "En, 11)  The quotation mark starts the phrase, let's consider it dependent on the main noun.
   * (11, person, 8) "person" is the object of "betyda."
   * (12, som, 11) "som" introduces the relative clause and modifies "person."
   * (13, arbetar, 12) "arbetar" depends on "som."
   * (14, ,, 13) The comma connects "arbetar" and "sover".
   * (15, sover, 12) "sover" depends on "som."
   * (16, och, 15) "och" coordinates "sover" and "lever."
   * (17, lever, 12) "lever" depends on "som."
   * (18, med, 17) "med" depends on "lever."
   * (19, datorer, 18) "datorer" is the object of "med."
   * (20, ", 11) The closing quotation mark depends on the main noun of the quoted phrase.
   * (21, ., 2) The full stop depends on the main verb.

   * **Double-check and refine:** Review the relationships to ensure they make grammatical sense. This iterative process is key. For example, my initial placement of "att" was incorrect and needed adjustment.

6. **Calculate Dependency Distances:** For each triple, the dependency distance is the absolute difference between the head index and the dependent index.

   * |1 - 2| = 1
   * |2 - 0| = 2
   * |3 - 5| = 2
   * |4 - 5| = 1
   * |5 - 2| = 3
   * |6 - 2| = 4
   * |7 - 8| = 1
   * |8 - 6| = 2
   * |9 - 8| = 1
   * |10 - 11| = 1
   * |11 - 8| = 3
   * |12 - 11| = 1
   * |13 - 12| = 1
   * |14 - 13| = 1
   * |15 - 12| = 3
   * |16 - 15| = 1
   * |17 - 12| = 5
   * |18 - 17| = 1
   * |19 - 18| = 1
   * |20 - 11| = 9
   * |21 - 2| = 19

7. **Compute the Average Dependency Distance:** Sum the distances and divide by the number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens minus 1, as the root has no head, or simply the number of non-zero head indices).

   Sum of distances = 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 9 + 19 = 63
   Number of dependencies = 21

   Average dependency distance = 63 / 21 = 3

This methodical approach, combining grammatical knowledge with careful tokenization and index management, leads to the correct dependency tree and average distance calculation. The key is to break down the task into manageable steps and double-check the relationships.

    dependencies.append((20, tokens[19], 11)) # " -> person
    dependencies.append((21, tokens[20], 2))  # . -> ändrade

    dependency_distances = [abs(head - dep) for dep, token, head in dependencies if head != 0]
    average_distance = sum(dependency_distances) / len(dependency_distances) if dependency_distances else 0

    return dependencies, average_distance

sentence = "Då ändrade ordet hacker mening till att betyda ungefär \"En person som arbetar, sover och lever med datorer\"."
dependency_tree, avg_distance = analyze_swedish_sentence(sentence)

print(dependency_tree)
print(f"Average Dependency Distance: {avg_distance}")
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Tokenization:** The sentence is split into individual tokens using spaces as delimiters. Leading/trailing whitespace is removed from each token.
2. **Manual Dependency Assignment:** Since we're not using an actual dependency parser, the dependencies are defined manually. This is the most crucial and potentially error-prone part if done without linguistic knowledge. Each tuple in the `dependencies` list represents a dependency relation:
   - The first number is the index of the dependent token (starting from 1).
   - The second entry is the dependent token itself.
   - The third number is the index of the head token. The root of the sentence is assigned a head index of 0.
3. **Dependency Distance Calculation:**
   - We iterate through the `dependencies` list.
   - For each dependency where the head is not the root (head index != 0), we calculate the absolute difference between the head's index and the dependent's index. This is the dependency distance.
4. **Average Dependency Distance:**
   - The sum of all dependency distances is calculated.
   - The average dependency distance is computed by dividing the sum of distances by the number of dependencies (excluding the root).
5. **Output:** The function returns the list of dependency triples and the calculated average dependency distance.

**Dependency Tree Breakdown for the Given Sentence:**

* **(1, 'Då', 2):** 'Då' (Then) modifies 'ändrade' (changed).
* **(2, 'ändrade', 0):** 'ändrade' is the main verb and the root of the sentence.
* **(3, 'ordet', 5):** 'ordet' (the word) modifies 'mening' (meaning).
* **(4, 'hacker', 5):** 'hacker' modifies 'mening'.
* **(5, 'mening', 2):** 'mening' is the object of 'ändrade'.
* **(6, 'till', 2):** 'till' (to) modifies 'ändrade'.
* **(7, 'att', 8):** 'att' (to - infinitive marker) is the head of 'betyda'.
* **(8, 'betyda', 6):** 'betyda' (to mean) depends on 'till'.
* **(9, 'ungefär', 8):** 'ungefär' (approximately) modifies 'betyda'.
* **(10, '"En', 11):** '"En' (a) modifies 'person'.
* **(11, 'person', 8):** 'person' (person) is the subject of 'betyda'.
* **(12, 'som', 11):** 'som' (who/that) introduces a relative clause modifying 'person'.
* **(13, 'arbetar', 12):** 'arbetar' (works) depends on 'som'.
* **(14, ',', 13):** The comma connects 'arbetar' and 'sover'.
* **(15, 'sover', 12):** 'sover' (sleeps) depends on 'som'.
* **(16, 'och', 15):** 'och' (and) conjoins 'sover' and 'lever'.
* **(17, 'lever', 12):** 'lever' (lives) depends on 'som'.
* **(18, 'med', 17):** 'med' (with) modifies 'lever'.
* **(19, 'datorer', 18):** 'datorer' (computers) is the object of 'med'.
* **(20, '"', 11):** The closing quotation mark relates to 'person'.
* **(21, '.', 2):** The full stop marks the end of the sentence and is attached to the main verb.

**Average Dependency Distance:** The calculated average dependency distance reflects how "long" the dependencies are on average within the sentence. A lower number generally suggests a simpler sentence structure with words closely related to their heads.

**Important Note:** This analysis is done manually. For more accurate and scalable dependency parsing, you would typically use natural language processing libraries that incorporate trained models for this task, such as SpaCy or Stanza, which have support for Swedish.
