Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence and generate the dependency tree:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The request asks for a dependency tree representation of a Swedish sentence, including punctuation as tokens, and the calculation of the average dependency distance. The output format is also specified.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence down into individual tokens. This includes words, numbers, and punctuation. Care must be taken with multi-word units like "ca 1 500".

    *  I
    *  Atlanten
    *  lever
    *  ca
    *  1
    *  500
    *  olika
    *  djurarter
    *  medan
    *  det
    *  i
    *  Östersjön
    *  bara
    *  finns
    *  ca
    *  80
    *  ,
    *  .

3. **Dependency Parsing (Conceptual):**  Now comes the core task of identifying the head of each token. This involves understanding the grammatical relationships between the words. I'll go through the sentence piece by piece:

    * **"I Atlanten lever"**:  "lever" (lives) is the main verb. "I Atlanten" (in the Atlantic) modifies where the living takes place. "Atlanten" is the object of the preposition "I".
    * **"ca 1 500 olika djurarter"**: This phrase describes *what* lives. "djurarter" (animal species) is the noun. "olika" (different) modifies "djurarter". "ca 1 500" modifies "olika," with "ca" modifying "1 500."  It's reasonable to attach "olika" directly to "djurarter" as the core description.
    * **"medan det i Östersjön bara finns"**: "medan" (while) is a conjunction introducing a new clause. "finns" (exists/are) is the main verb of this clause. "det" (it/there) is the subject (often a dummy subject in Swedish in existential clauses). "i Östersjön" (in the Baltic Sea) modifies where the existence takes place. "Östersjön" is the object of "i". "bara" (only) modifies "finns".
    * **"ca 80"**: This describes *how many* exist. "80" is the number, and "ca" modifies it.
    * **", ."**:  These are punctuation marks. They typically attach to the main verb or the root of their respective clauses.

4. **Assigning Heads and Indices (Iterative Process):** Now I'll go through each token and assign its head and the corresponding indices:

    * **I (1):**  Head is "lever" (3). (1, I, 3)
    * **Atlanten (2):** Head is "I" (1). (2, Atlanten, 1)
    * **lever (3):** This is a main verb. Its head is the root (0). (3, lever, 0)
    * **ca (4):** Head is "olika" (7). (4, ca, 7)  *Initial thought might be to connect to "1", but the whole quantity phrase modifies the adjective.*
    * **1 (5):** Head is "olika" (7). (5, 1, 7) *Part of the quantity modifying the adjective.*
    * **500 (6):** Head is "olika" (7). (6, 500, 7) *Continuing the quantity modification.*
    * **olika (7):** Head is "djurarter" (8). (7, olika, 8)
    * **djurarter (8):** Head is "lever" (3). (8, djurarter, 3)
    * **medan (9):** This is a conjunction linking clauses. Head is "lever" (3). (9, medan, 3)
    * **det (10):** Head is "finns" (14). (10, det, 14)
    * **i (11):** Head is "finns" (14). (11, i, 14) *Connecting the prepositional phrase to the verb.*
    * **Östersjön (12):** Head is "i" (11). (12, Östersjön, 11)
    * **bara (13):** Head is "finns" (14). (13, bara, 14)
    * **finns (14):** Head is "medan" (9). (14, finns, 9) *The verb of the subordinate clause connects to the conjunction.*
    * **ca (15):** Head is "80" (16). (15, ca, 16)
    * **80 (16):** Head is "finns" (14). (16, 80, 14)
    * **, (17):** Head is "finns" (14). (17, ,, 14) *Punctuation at the clause level.*
    * **. (18):** Head is "lever" (3). (18, ., 3) *Sentence-ending punctuation connects to the main verb.*

5. **Formatting the Output:**  Arrange the collected information into the specified list of tuples.

6. **Calculate Dependency Distances:**  For each token (except the root), calculate the absolute difference between its index and the index of its head.

    * |I - lever| = |1 - 3| = 2
    * |Atlanten - I| = |2 - 1| = 1
    * |ca - olika| = |4 - 7| = 3
    * |1 - olika| = |5 - 7| = 2
    * |500 - olika| = |6 - 7| = 1
    * |olika - djurarter| = |7 - 8| = 1
    * |djurarter - lever| = |8 - 3| = 5
    * |medan - lever| = |9 - 3| = 6
    * |det - finns| = |10 - 14| = 4
    * |i - finns| = |11 - 14| = 3
    * |Östersjön - i| = |12 - 11| = 1
    * |bara - finns| = |13 - 14| = 1
    * |finns - medan| = |14 - 9| = 5
    * |ca - 80| = |15 - 16| = 1
    * |80 - finns| = |16 - 14| = 2
    * |,- finns| = |17 - 14| = 3
    * |.- lever| = |18 - 3| = 15

7. **Calculate Average Distance:** Sum the distances and divide by the number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens minus 1, or the number of non-root dependencies).

    * Total distance = 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 15 = 56
    * Number of dependencies = 17
    * Average distance = 56 / 17 ≈ 3.29

8. **Final Review:**  Double-check the dependency relationships and the calculations. Ensure the output format matches the request.

    tokens = sentence.split(' ')

    # Calculate average dependency distance
    total_distance = 0
    for head_index, _, dependent_index in dependencies:
        if dependent_index != 0:
            total_distance += abs(head_index - dependent_index)

    average_distance = total_distance / len([dep for dep in dependencies if dep[2] != 0])

    return dependencies, average_distance

sentence = "I Atlanten lever ca 1 500 olika djurarter medan det i Östersjön bara finns ca 80, ."
dependency_tree, avg_distance = analyze_swedish_sentence(sentence)

print(dependency_tree)
print(f"Average dependency distance: {avg_distance}")
```

**Output:**

```
[(1, 'I', 3), (2, 'Atlanten', 1), (3, 'lever', 0), (4, 'ca', 7), (5, '1', 7), (6, '500', 7), (7, 'olika', 8), (8, 'djurarter', 3), (9, 'medan', 3), (10, 'det', 14), (11, 'i', 14), (12, 'Östersjön', 11), (13, 'bara', 14), (14, 'finns', 9), (15, 'ca', 16), (16, '80', 14), (17, ',', 14), (18, '.', 3)]

* **(18, '.', 3):** The full stop "." at index 18 is a dependent of the main verb "lever" at index 3, marking the end of the sentence.

**Average Dependency Distance:**

The average dependency distance is calculated by summing the absolute differences between the indices of the head and dependent tokens for all dependencies (excluding the root) and dividing by the number of dependencies. In this case, the average distance is approximately 3.29. This provides a measure of how "long" the dependency relationships are on average within the sentence.
