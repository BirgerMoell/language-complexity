Here's a breakdown of the thought process to achieve the dependency tree and average distance:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The request is to analyze a Swedish sentence, create a dependency tree in a specific format, and calculate the average dependency distance. This requires knowledge of Swedish grammar and dependency parsing principles.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence down into individual tokens. This is relatively straightforward, treating spaces and punctuation as delimiters. It's important to be precise here as the token indices will be based on this.

3. **Dependency Parsing (the core task):** This is the most complex part. We need to identify the head (governor) of each word. This requires understanding the grammatical relationships between words. Here's a possible internal thought process for each word:

    * **Ett:**  "One of..." - Modifier of "delmålen".
    * **av:** Preposition governing "delmålen".
    * **delmålen:** The noun phrase "ett av delmålen" is the subject of the main clause. "delmålen" is the head of this phrase.
    * **med:** Preposition governing "NTRAC".
    * **NTRAC:**  Part of the prepositional phrase "med NTRAC".
    * **har:** Auxiliary verb for "varit".
    * **varit:**  Main verb of the first clause. "delmålen" is the subject.
    * **att:** Subordinating conjunction introducing a subordinate clause. Often attaches to the verb it modifies.
    * **det:** Subject of the subordinate clause.
    * **lätt:** Adverb modifying "ska kunna anpassas".
    * **ska:** Auxiliary verb for "kunna".
    * **kunna:** Auxiliary verb for "anpassas".
    * **anpassas:** Main verb of the subordinate clause. What *can* be adapted? "det".
    * **till:** Preposition governing "olika fordon".
    * **olika:** Adjective modifying "fordon".
    * **fordon:** Noun, object of the preposition "till".
    * **,:** Punctuation, generally attached to the head of the clause it separates. In this case, the preceding verb "anpassas".
    * **NTRAC:** Subject of the second main clause.
    * **har:** Auxiliary verb for "implementerats".
    * **därför:** Adverbial modifying "implementerats".
    * **implementerats:** Main verb of the second clause.
    * **i:** Preposition governing "två testbilar".
    * **två:** Numeral modifying "testbilar".
    * **testbilar:** Noun, object of the preposition "i".
    * **av:** Preposition governing "mycket skiljda fysikaliska mått och motorkaraktäristik".
    * **mycket:** Adverb modifying "skiljda".
    * **skiljda:** Adjective modifying "fysikaliska mått och motorkaraktäristik".
    * **fysikaliska:** Adjective modifying "mått".
    * **mått:** First part of the coordinated noun phrase.
    * **och:** Coordinating conjunction, connects "mått" and "motorkaraktäristik". The second conjunct usually attaches to the first.
    * **motorkaraktäristik:** Second part of the coordinated noun phrase.
    * **.:** Punctuation, attached to the main verb of the clause.

4. **Representing the Tree:**  The requested format is a list of tuples: `(token_index, token, head_index)`. Now, translate the dependency relationships identified in step 3 into this format. Crucially, remember that the root of the sentence has a head index of 0.

5. **Calculate Dependency Distances:** For each dependency link (each tuple in the tree), calculate the absolute difference between the token index and the head index.

6. **Calculate Average Distance:** Sum the dependency distances calculated in step 5 and divide by the total number of dependency links (which is the number of tokens minus the root, or simply the number of tokens if you count the root's "dependency" to 0).

7. **Format the Output:** Present the dependency tree and the average dependency distance clearly.

**Self-Correction/Refinement during the process:**

* **Initial thought on "att":**  Could I attach "att" to "har varit"? While "att" often introduces a purpose clause connected to the verb, in this construction "har varit att..." it's more of a linking element for the predicate nominative. "varit" is the main verb establishing the state, and "att det lätt ska kunna anpassas..." is what that state *is*.
* **Handling coordination ("och"):**  Recognize the coordination and ensure the correct linking. The second conjunct usually depends on the first.
* **Prepositional Phrases:** Correctly identify the head of the prepositional phrase (the noun) and the preposition's governor.
* **Double-checking indices:** It's easy to make off-by-one errors with indices. Carefully recount token positions to ensure accuracy.
* **Punctuation attachment:** While sometimes debated, attaching punctuation to the main verb or the head of the preceding clause is a common practice.

By following these steps and incorporating self-correction, we arrive at the accurate dependency tree and average distance.
Here's the dependency analysis and dependency tree for the given Swedish sentence:

**Sentence:** Ett av delmålen med NTRAC har varit att det lätt ska kunna anpassas till olika fordon,  NTRAC har därför implementerats i två testbilar av mycket skiljda fysikaliska mått och  motorkaraktäristik.

**Dependency Tree:**

[(1, Ett, 3), (2, av, 1), (3, delmålen, 7), (4, med, 3), (5, NTRAC, 4), (6, har, 7), (7, varit, 0), (8, att, 13), (9, det, 13), (10, lätt, 13), (11, ska, 13), (12, kunna, 13), (13, anpassas, 7), (14, till, 13), (15, olika, 16), (16, fordon, 14), (17, ,, 13), (18, NTRAC, 20), (19, har, 20), (20, implementerats, 7), (21, därför, 20), (22, i, 20), (23, två, 24), (24, testbilar, 22), (25, av, 24), (26, mycket, 27), (27, skiljda, 25), (28, fysikaliska, 29), (29, mått, 27), (30, och, 29), (31, motorkaraktäristik, 29), (32, ., 20)]

**Average Dependency Distance:**

To calculate the average dependency distance, we sum the absolute differences between the token index and the head index for each token and divide by the total number of tokens (excluding the root as it doesn't have a head).

Dependency Distances:

| Token Index | Head Index | Distance |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3 | 2 |
| 2 | 1 | 1 |
| 3 | 7 | 4 |
| 4 | 3 | 1 |
| 5 | 4 | 1 |
| 6 | 7 | 1 |
| 7 | 0 | 7 |
| 8 | 13 | 5 |
| 9 | 13 | 4 |
| 10 | 13 | 3 |
| 11 | 13 | 2 |
| 12 | 13 | 1 |
| 13 | 7 | 6 |
| 14 | 13 | 1 |

| 32 | 20 | 12 |
| **Total Distance** |  | **84** |

**Number of Tokens (excluding root):** 32

**Average Dependency Distance:** 84 / 32 = **2.625**
