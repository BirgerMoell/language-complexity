Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence and produce the dependency tree:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The request is to analyze a Swedish sentence, create a dependency tree representation, and calculate the average dependency distance.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence down into individual tokens. This includes words and punctuation. Care must be taken to separate connected elements like hyphens.

    *Initial Thought:*  Simply split by spaces.

    *Refinement:* Recognize that punctuation (comma, period) needs to be its own token. Also, hyphenated words like "1100- och" and "icke-judiska" need to be handled. Splitting by spaces won't be enough.

    *Action:* Manually go through the sentence and create a list of tokens: `['Det', 'började', 'också', 'med', 'att', 'vid', '1100-', 'och', '1200-talet', 'då', 'judarna', 'bodde', 'på', 'icke-judiska', 'länder', ',', 'började', 'kristnas', 'attityd', 'ändras', 'fientligt', 'mot', 'judarna', 'vilket', 'också', 'ledde', 'till', 'grunden', 'av', 'rasism', 'som', 'har', 'utvecklats', '.']`

3. **Dependency Parsing (The Core Challenge):**  This is the most complex part. We need to identify the head of each token's dependency. This requires understanding Swedish grammar and the relationships between words. A systematic approach is necessary.

    *Initial Strategy:* Start with the main verb and work outwards.

    *Application and Refinement (Iterative Process):*

    * **Identify the Main Clause:** The sentence has multiple clauses connected by conjunctions and relative pronouns. The core action seems to be related to "började" (started). There are two instances of "började." The first one ("Det började...") seems to be about the *beginning* of something. The second "började" (...började kristnas attityd...) appears to be the actual beginning of the change in attitude. This suggests the second "började" is the main verb of the main clause.

    * **Subject and Object of the Main Clause:**  Who or what started? "kristnas attityd" (Christian's attitude) is the subject. What did it start doing? "ändras" (to change).

    * **Adverbial Modifiers:**  Words like "fientligt" (hostilely) modify "ändras."  Prepositional phrases like "mot judarna" (towards the Jews) also modify "ändras."

    * **Connecting Clauses:**  The phrase "Det började också med att..." introduces the initial event. "vilket också ledde till grunden av rasism som har utvecklats" is a relative clause modifying the preceding idea.

    * **Handling Complex Phrases:** "vid 1100- och 1200-talet" is a temporal adverbial phrase modifying the initial "började." "då judarna bodde på icke-judiska länder" is a subordinate clause providing context.

    * **Working Through Each Token:**  Systematically consider each token and its relationship to other tokens. Ask questions like: What does this word modify? What is the head of this phrase?

    * **Addressing the Two "började":** The first "började" seems to govern the introductory part of the sentence. "med att" is a construction that often takes a following verb.

    * **The Relative Clause:** "vilket" refers back to the changing attitude. "ledde" is the verb of this clause. "till grunden" is a prepositional phrase, and "av rasism" modifies "grunden." The relative clause "som har utvecklats" modifies "rasism."

    * **Punctuation:** Punctuation typically depends on the element it's associated with. The commas separate phrases and the period ends the sentence.

4. **Create the Dependency Tree Representation:** Once the dependencies are established, represent them in the specified format: `(index, token, head_index)`. Remember to assign indices to the tokens starting from 1. The root of the sentence (the main verb) will have a head index of 0.

5. **Calculate Average Dependency Distance:**

    * **Calculate Individual Distances:**  For each token, find the absolute difference between its index and its head's index.

    * **Sum the Distances:** Add up all the individual distances.

    * **Divide by the Number of Tokens:** Divide the sum by the total number of tokens to get the average.

6. **Review and Refine:**  Go back through the dependency tree and the average distance calculation. Double-check the relationships and calculations for accuracy. Look for inconsistencies or missed connections. For example, ensure that every token (except the root) has exactly one head.

**Self-Correction Example During the Process:**

*Initial Thought on "också":* Maybe "också" modifies the verb "började."

*Refinement:* Considering the sentence structure, the first "också" seems to modify the entire initial statement "Det började med att...". The second "också" similarly modifies "ledde."  This kind of refinement happens through careful consideration of meaning and grammatical function.

By following this systematic process, including iterative refinement and self-correction, we can arrive at the correct dependency tree and average dependency distance.

```

**Average Dependency Distance Calculation:**

To calculate the average dependency distance, we sum the absolute differences between the index of each token and its head, and then divide by the total number of tokens.

| Token Index | Token        | Head Index | Distance |

| **Total**   |              |            | **141**  |

**Number of tokens:** 34

**Average Dependency Distance:** 141 / 34 = **4.147** (approximately)
