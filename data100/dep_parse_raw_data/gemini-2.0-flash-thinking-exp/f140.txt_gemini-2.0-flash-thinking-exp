Here's a breakdown of the thought process to arrive at the dependency tree and average dependency distance:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The request asks for a dependency analysis and average dependency distance calculation for a Swedish sentence. This involves identifying the relationships between words (head and dependent) and then calculating the average distance between them.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence into individual tokens. This is relatively straightforward, separating words and punctuation.

   *  "Vid"
   *  "midnatten"
   *  "blir"
   *  "allt"
   *  "klart"
   *  "med"
   *  "valet"
   *  "och"
   *  "sedan"
   *  "rapporterar"
   *  "man"
   *  "hur"
   *  "valresultatet"
   *  "ser"
   *  "ut"
   *  "."

3. **Dependency Parsing (The Core Challenge):** This is the most complex part. It requires understanding the grammatical structure of the sentence and the role of each word. I'll go through it roughly word by word, thinking about what each word modifies or what it depends on. It's often helpful to start with the main verbs.

   * **"blir" (becomes):** This seems like a central verb in the first part of the sentence. What becomes clear? "allt" (everything). So "allt" depends on "blir". "klart" is an adjective describing "allt", so it likely depends on "allt". "Vid midnatten" specifies *when* this happens, modifying "blir". "med valet" also modifies "klart", specifying *what* it's clear *with* or *about*.

   * **"rapporterar" (reports):** This is the main verb of the second part of the sentence. Who reports? "man" (one/they). What do they report?  The whole clause "hur valresultatet ser ut". "sedan" is an adverb modifying "rapporterar", indicating *when* the reporting occurs.

   * **"hur" (how):** This introduces a subordinate clause. It connects the reporting to the way the election result looks. It doesn't depend on anything within its own clause in a direct head-dependent way. It depends on "rapporterar" as it's the object of the reporting.

   * **"valresultatet" (the election result):** This is the subject of the verb "ser".

   * **"ser" (looks):** This is the verb of the subordinate clause. Its subject is "valresultatet".

   * **"ut" (out):** This is a particle belonging to the phrasal verb "ser ut". It depends on "ser".

   * **"och" (and):** This is a conjunction connecting the two main clauses. The second clause depends on the first clause's main verb.

   * **"." (period):** Punctuation typically depends on the main verb of the clause it concludes. Since it concludes the entire sentence, we can attach it to the root verb of the second clause, "rapporterar".

4. **Assigning Heads and Indices:** Now, convert the dependency relationships into the specified format: `(dependent_index, dependent_word, head_index)`. Assign indices starting from 1.

   * (1, Vid, 3)  (Vid modifies blir)
   * (2, midnatten, 1) (midnatten is the object of the preposition Vid)
   * (3, blir, 0) (root of the first clause)
   * (4, allt, 3) (allt is the subject of blir)
   * (5, klart, 4) (klart describes allt)
   * (6, med, 5) (med modifies klart)
   * (7, valet, 6) (valet is the object of the preposition med)
   * (8, och, 10) (och connects the clauses, depends on the second clause's verb)
   * (9, sedan, 10) (sedan modifies rapporterar)
   * (10, rapporterar, 3) (root of the second clause, connected to the first with 'och')
   * (11, man, 10) (man is the subject of rapporterar)
   * (12, hur, 10) (hur introduces the object clause of rapporterar)
   * (13, valresultatet, 14) (valresultatet is the subject of ser)
   * (14, ser, 12) (ser is the verb in the subordinate clause)
   * (15, ut, 14) (ut is a particle of the phrasal verb ser ut)
   * (16, ., 10) (punctuation depends on the main verb)

   *Self-Correction During Parsing:* Initially, I might have connected "och" to the first verb "blir". However, grammatically, "och" conjoins clauses, and its dependency should reflect that connection, typically to the root of the second clause. Similarly, "hur" introduces a subordinate clause acting as the object, hence its dependence on "rapporterar".

5. **Calculate Dependency Distances:**  For each dependency, calculate the absolute difference between the head index and the dependent index.

   * |1 - 3| = 2
   * |2 - 1| = 1
   * |3 - 0| = 3
   * |4 - 3| = 1
   * |5 - 4| = 1
   * |6 - 5| = 1
   * |7 - 6| = 1
   * |8 - 10| = 2
   * |9 - 10| = 1
   * |10 - 3| = 7
   * |11 - 10| = 1
   * |12 - 10| = 2
   * |13 - 14| = 1
   * |14 - 12| = 2
   * |15 - 14| = 1
   * |16 - 10| = 6

6. **Compute Average Distance:** Sum the distances and divide by the total number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens minus 1, or equivalently, the number of triples).

   * Total distance = 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 33
   * Number of dependencies = 16
   * Average distance = 33 / 16 = 2.0625

7. **Format Output:** Present the dependency tree as a list of tuples and the average distance clearly.
Here's the dependency analysis and tree for the Swedish sentence:

**Dependency Tree:**

[(1, Vid, 3), (2, midnatten, 1), (3, blir, 0), (4, allt, 3), (5, klart, 4), (6, med, 5), (7, valet, 6), (8, och, 10), (9, sedan, 10), (10, rapporterar, 3), (11, man, 10), (12, hur, 14), (13, valresultatet, 14), (14, ser, 12), (15, ut, 14), (16, ., 10)]

**Explanation of Dependencies:**

* **(1, Vid, 3):** The preposition "Vid" modifies the verb "blir".
* **(2, midnatten, 1):** The noun "midnatten" is the object of the preposition "Vid".
* **(3, blir, 0):** The verb "blir" is the root of the first clause.
* **(4, allt, 3):** The pronoun "allt" is the subject of the verb "blir".
* **(5, klart, 4):** The adjective "klart" describes "allt".
* **(6, med, 5):** The preposition "med" modifies the adjective "klart".
* **(7, valet, 6):** The noun "valet" is the object of the preposition "med".
* **(8, och, 10):** The conjunction "och" connects the two clauses, depending on the main verb of the second clause.
* **(9, sedan, 10):** The adverb "sedan" modifies the verb "rapporterar".
* **(10, rapporterar, 3):** The verb "rapporterar" is the root of the second clause and is coordinated with "blir".
* **(11, man, 10):** The pronoun "man" is the subject of the verb "rapporterar".
* **(12, hur, 14):** The adverb "hur" modifies the verb "ser".
* **(13, valresultatet, 14):** The noun "valresultatet" is the subject of the verb "ser".
* **(14, ser, 12):** The verb "ser" is the head of the subordinate clause describing how the result looks.
* **(15, ut, 14):** The particle "ut" is part of the phrasal verb "ser ut".
* **(16, ., 10):** The punctuation mark "." depends on the main verb of the clause it ends.

**Average Dependency Distance:**

To calculate the average dependency distance, we sum the absolute differences between the head and dependent indices for each dependency and divide by the total number of dependencies.

| Dependent | Head | Distance |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3 | 2 |
| 2 | 1 | 1 |
| 3 | 0 | 3 |
| 4 | 3 | 1 |
| 5 | 4 | 1 |
| 6 | 5 | 1 |
| 7 | 6 | 1 |
| 8 | 10 | 2 |
| 9 | 10 | 1 |
| 10 | 3 | 7 |
| 11 | 10 | 1 |
| 12 | 14 | 2 |
| 13 | 14 | 1 |
| 14 | 12 | 2 |
| 15 | 14 | 1 |
| 16 | 10 | 6 |
| **Total** |  | **33** |

Average Dependency Distance = Total Distance / Number of Dependencies
Average Dependency Distance = 33 / 16 = **2.0625**
