Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence and create the dependency tree:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The primary goal is to create a dependency tree representation of a Swedish sentence and calculate the average dependency distance. The format for the tree is specified: `(token_index, token, head_index)`.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break down the sentence into individual tokens. This is crucial for assigning indices. I need to identify words, punctuation, and any special characters that should be treated as separate tokens. Careful attention to words like "avbrottskost-nad" is needed – it should be treated as one token as indicated by the hyphen.

3. **Syntactic Analysis (Dependency Parsing):**  This is the core of the task. I need to determine the grammatical relationships between the tokens. For each token, I need to identify its head (the word it depends on). This often requires understanding the meaning and grammatical structure of the sentence. Here's how I'd approach it conceptually:

    * **Identify the main verb:**  The main verb is usually the starting point. In this sentence, "har varit" (has been) is the main verb phrase. The auxiliary verb "har" depends on "varit".

    * **Find the subject:**  What is the subject of "har varit"?  It's "Syftet" (the purpose). So, "Syftet" depends on "varit".

    * **Analyze prepositional phrases:**  "med simuleringarna" (with the simulations) modifies "Syftet". "med" is the head of the phrase, and "simuleringarna" depends on "med".

    * **Analyze the infinitive clause:** "att undersöka om det går att minimera..." (to investigate whether it is possible to minimize...). The infinitive marker "att" depends on "varit". The verb "undersöka" depends on "att".

    * **Analyze subordinate clauses:** "om det går att minimera..." (whether it is possible to minimize...). "om" introduces the subordinate clause and depends on "undersöka". The verb "går" depends on "om". "det" is the subject of "går". "att minimera" is another infinitive phrase depending on "går".

    * **Analyze objects and complements:** What is being minimized? "den totala kostnaden" (the total cost). "kostnaden" depends on "minimera". "den" and "totala" are determiners and adjectives modifying "kostnaden".

    * **Handle conjunctions and lists:** ", investeringskostnader samt förväntade avbrottskost- nad"  (investment costs as well as expected interruption cost). "samt" conjoins "investeringskostnader" and "förväntade avbrottskost-nad". Both depend on "kostnaden" as they are parts of the cost. "förväntade" modifies "avbrottskost-nad".

    * **Analyze adverbial phrases:** "genom slumpvisa investeringar i systemets ledningssektioner" (through random investments in the system's line sections). "genom" is the head. "investeringar" depends on "genom". "slumpvisa" modifies "investeringar". "i" introduces another prepositional phrase, and "systemets" and "ledningssektioner" follow the possessive structure.

    * **Handle punctuation:** The comma and the period need to be attached to their respective clauses or the main verb.

4. **Assign Indices:** Once the dependency relationships are clear, assign numerical indices to each token, starting from 1.

5. **Construct the Dependency Tree:** Create the list of triples according to the specified format. Make sure the head indices correctly reflect the dependency analysis. The root of the sentence (the main verb) will have a head index of 0.

6. **Calculate Dependency Distances:**  For each dependency relation `(i, token_i, j)`, the dependency distance is the absolute difference between the indices: `|i - j|`.

7. **Calculate Average Dependency Distance:** Sum the individual dependency distances and divide by the total number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens minus 1, or the number of arrows in the dependency tree).

8. **Review and Verify:** Double-check the dependency relationships and the calculated distances. Ensure the output format is correct. Consider edge cases and potential ambiguities in the sentence structure. (Self-correction:  Initially, I might have incorrectly attached "samt" to "kostnaden". Reviewing the meaning clarifies that it connects the two types of costs).

**Explanation of the Dependency Tree:**

Each tuple in the `dependency_tree` list represents a dependency relation:

* **(1, "Syftet", 7):** The token "Syftet" (The purpose) at index 1 depends on the token "varit" (has been) at index 7.
* **(2, "med", 1):** The token "med" (with) at index 2 depends on the token "Syftet" at index 1.
* **...and so on.**

The head index `0` indicates the root of the sentence, which is the main verb "varit".

**Explanation of the Dependencies:**

This dependency analysis represents the grammatical relationships in the sentence:

* **"Syftet"** is the subject of the verb **"har varit"**.
* **"med simuleringarna"** is a prepositional phrase modifying **"Syftet"**.
* **"att undersöka..."** is an infinitive clause that is the purpose of the action ("har varit").
* **"om det går..."** is a subordinate clause object of **"undersöka"**.
* **"att minimera..."** is another infinitive clause object of **"går"**.
* **"den totala kostnaden"**, **"investeringskostnader"**, and **"förväntade avbrottskost- nad"** are noun phrases being minimized. The commas and "samt" act as conjunctions.
* **"genom slumpvisa investeringar..."** is a prepositional phrase indicating the means of minimization.
* **"i systemets ledningssektioner"** is a prepositional phrase modifying **"investeringar"**.

**Average Dependency Distance:**

The average dependency distance is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between the indices of the dependent and head tokens, divided by the total number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens minus 1). In this case, it reflects the average "distance" between related words in the sentence structure.
