Here's a breakdown of the thought process to arrive at the dependency tree and average dependency distance:

1. **Understand the Request:** The core task is to create a dependency tree for a Swedish sentence and calculate the average dependency distance. The output format is specified as a list of tuples: `(token_index, token, head_index)`. Punctuation needs to be included.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to split the sentence into individual tokens. This is fairly straightforward given the provided spacing.

3. **Dependency Parsing (The Hard Part):** This is where the linguistic knowledge comes in. I need to determine the head of each word in the sentence. This requires understanding Swedish grammar, including:

    * **Word Order:**  Swedish generally follows a Subject-Verb-Object order in main clauses, but subordinate clauses and questions can deviate. Modifiers usually precede the words they modify.
    * **Parts of Speech:** Identifying nouns, verbs, adjectives, prepositions, conjunctions, etc., is crucial for understanding the relationships between words.
    * **Function Words:** Words like articles, prepositions, and conjunctions often link other words together.
    * **Relative Clauses:** Understanding how relative clauses modify nouns is important for correctly linking the clause to its head.

4. **Step-by-Step Dependency Assignment (Trial and Error/Reasoning):**  I'll go through the sentence token by token, deciding on the head for each:

    * **"Den" (1):**  Likely the determiner for "typ" (2). Head: 2
    * **"typ" (2):**  The noun being described. The core of the noun phrase. Needs a head from the main clause.
    * **"av" (3):** A preposition connecting "typ" to "protes". Head: 2
    * **"protes" (4):**  The object of the preposition "av". Head: 3
    * **"som" (5):**  The relative pronoun introducing the subordinate clause. It modifies "protes". Head: 4
    * **"är" (6):** The verb in the relative clause. Its subject is "som". Head: 5
    * **"bäst" (7):** An adjective modifying "lämpad". Head: 8
    * **"lämpad" (8):** The past participle, the core of the verb phrase in the relative clause. Head: 6
    * **"att" (9):** The infinitive marker introducing the infinitive phrase. Head: 8
    * **"tillverka" (10):** The infinitive verb. Head: 9
    * **"med" (11):** A preposition connecting "tillverka" to "tillverkning". Head: 10
    * **"adderande" (12):** An adjective modifying "tillverkning". Head: 13
    * **"tillverkning" (13):** The object of the preposition "med". Head: 11
    * **"är" (14):**  The main verb of the sentence. Its subject is "typ" (with its modifiers). Head: 0 (root)
    * **"en" (15):**  The determiner for "modell". Head: 16
    * **"enkel" (16):** An adjective modifying "modell". Head: 17
    * **"modell" (17):** The noun phrase functioning as the predicate nominative. Head: 14
    * **"av" (18):** A preposition connecting "modell" to "armprotes". Head: 17
    * **"kroppsdriven" (19):** An adjective modifying "armprotes". Head: 20
    * **"mekanisk" (20):** An adjective modifying "armprotes". Head: 21
    * **"armprotes" (21):** The object of the preposition "av". Head: 18
    * **"." (22):**  Punctuation, attached to the root. Head: 14

5. **Verification and Refinement:** I'll review the dependencies to make sure they make grammatical sense. For instance, I'd check if each word has a clear head that governs it. Are there any ambiguities?  Does the structure capture the meaning of the sentence?  The relative clause "som är bäst lämpad att tillverka med adderande tillverkning" clearly modifies "protes".

6. **Construct the Dependency Tree Output:**  Now I'll format the dependencies into the required list of tuples. This involves carefully counting the token indices.

7. **Calculate Dependency Distances:** For each token (except the root), calculate the absolute difference between its index and the index of its head.

8. **Calculate Average Dependency Distance:** Sum the dependency distances and divide by the number of tokens (excluding the root, as it doesn't have a head within the sentence).

**Self-Correction/Alternative Considerations During Parsing:**

* **Ambiguity:**  Sometimes, dependency relationships can be ambiguous. For instance, with multiple prepositional phrases, it might not be immediately clear which noun a phrase modifies. In this sentence, the structure is fairly clear due to the relative clause and the conjunctions/prepositions used.
* **Different Parsing Styles:** Different dependency parsing schemes exist. I'm implicitly using a fairly standard approach where function words attach to the content words they modify.
* **Software Assistance:** While I'm doing this manually, in practice, NLP software libraries (like spaCy, NLTK with a parser, etc.) would be used for more complex sentences. These tools use statistical models trained on large datasets.

By following these steps, carefully considering the grammatical relationships, and paying attention to the required output format, I can arrive at the correct dependency tree and average dependency distance.

swedish_sentence = "Den	   typ	   av	   protes	   som	   är	    bäst	   lämpad	   att	   tillverka	   med	   adderande	   tillverkning	   är	   en	   enkel	   modell	   av	   kroppsdriven	    mekanisk	    armprotes."

```

**Explanation of the Dependency Tree:**

The output `[(1, 'Den', 2), (2, 'typ', 14), ...]` represents the dependency relationships as follows:

* **(1, 'Den', 2):** The token at index 1 ("Den") is dependent on the token at index 2 ("typ"). "typ" is the head of "Den".
* **(2, 'typ', 14):** The token at index 2 ("typ") is dependent on the token at index 14 ("är"). "är" (the main verb) is the head of the noun "typ" (the subject of the main clause).
* **(3, 'av', 2):** The token at index 3 ("av") is dependent on the token at index 2 ("typ"). The preposition "av" modifies "typ".
* **...and so on.**

The head index `0` indicates the root of the sentence, which is usually the main verb. In this case, the second occurrence of "är" (at index 14) is identified as the root.

**Explanation of the Average Dependency Distance:**

The average dependency distance is calculated as the average of the distances between each token and its head. The distance is simply the absolute difference between their indices. A smaller average distance generally indicates a more "right-branching" structure, while a larger distance might suggest more embedded or complex sentence structures.

**Important Notes:**

* **Manual Dependency Assignment:** The dependency tree provided above is based on a manual interpretation of the sentence structure. For complex sentences, and for more rigorous analysis, using a dedicated dependency parsing library (like those available in spaCy or other NLP tools) is highly recommended. These tools are trained on large datasets and can produce more accurate and consistent dependency trees.
* **Tokenization:** The provided sentence has extra spaces. The code splits based on whitespace, which works in this case, but in real-world scenarios, more robust tokenization techniques might be needed to handle punctuation and other edge cases.
* **Swedish Grammar Complexity:** Swedish grammar, like any language, has nuances and ambiguities. A perfect dependency tree requires a deep understanding of these rules. The manual assignment here aims for a reasonable representation.
