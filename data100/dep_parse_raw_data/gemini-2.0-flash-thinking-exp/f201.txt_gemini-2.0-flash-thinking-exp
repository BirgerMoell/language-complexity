Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence and create the dependency tree:

1. **Understanding the Goal:** The primary goal is to create a dependency tree representation of the Swedish sentence and calculate the average dependency distance. The output format is clearly specified: `[(token_index, token, head_index), ...]`.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence into individual tokens. This includes words and punctuation marks.

   * Initial scan reveals words like "Sjukdomar," "kunde," "sprida," etc., and punctuation marks like commas and the period.
   * Need to be precise about where to split: spaces generally delineate tokens, but punctuation needs to be treated separately.

3. **Assigning Token Indices:**  Each token needs a unique index, starting from 1 and incrementing sequentially. This is crucial for referencing tokens in the dependency relations.

4. **Dependency Parsing (The Core Challenge):**  This is the most complex part. It involves identifying the head (governor) of each token. The head is the word that syntactically governs another word. This often involves understanding grammatical relationships.

   * **Start with Verbs:** Verbs are often the roots of clauses. Look for the main verbs in the sentence. In this sentence, "kunde sprida," "märkte," "började bli," and "spelade" seem like key verbs.
   * **Subject-Verb Relationship:**  Identify the subject of each verb. For example, "Sjukdomar" is the subject of "kunde sprida."
   * **Object-Verb Relationship:** Identify the objects of verbs. "sig" is the reflexive object of "sprida." "att någon började bli sjuk" is the object of "märkte."
   * **Adjective/Adverb Modification:** Determine which words modify nouns, verbs, or other adjectives/adverbs. "väldigt" modifies "snabbt." "snabbt" modifies "sprida."
   * **Conjunctions and Subordinating Conjunctions:** Understand how clauses are connected. "så" connects "sprida sig väldigt snabbt" and "när besättningen märkte..." "när" introduces the subordinate clause. "att" introduces a subordinate clause within the "märkte" clause. "om" introduces a subordinate clause within the "spelade" clause.
   * **Prepositions:** Identify the objects of prepositions (even though there aren't many in this sentence).
   * **Punctuation:** Determine the role of punctuation. Commas often separate clauses or list items. The period marks the end of a sentence. It's reasonable to make the root of the clause (the main verb) the head of punctuation directly following it.
   * **"det" as a Placeholder/Expletive Subject:**  Recognize the function of "det" in "det spelade ingen roll."  It often refers to the situation described in the preceding clause or acts as a placeholder. In this case, "spelade" is likely the head.
   * **"man" as an Impersonal Pronoun:**  Understand the role of "man." In this context, it's impersonal and the verb "kastade" is the head.

5. **Iterative Refinement:** Parsing is not always linear. You might need to revisit decisions as you analyze more of the sentence. If a relationship feels awkward, re-evaluate.

6. **Representing the Dependencies:**  Once the head-dependent relationships are identified, translate them into the specified tuple format: `(dependent_index, dependent_token, head_index)`. The root of the sentence (main verb of the main clause) has a head index of 0.

7. **Calculating Dependency Distance:**

   * For each dependency relation in the tree, calculate the absolute difference between the index of the head and the index of the dependent.
   * Sum these distances.
   * Divide the sum by the total number of dependencies (the number of tokens minus 1, or the number of tuples).

8. **Double-Checking:**  Review the generated dependency tree and ensure that:

   * Every token (except the root) has a head.
   * The head indices point to valid token indices.
   * The relationships make grammatical sense.

**Example of a Mini-Iteration during Parsing (for "kunde sprida sig"):**

* **Initial Thought:** "kunde" is the main verb, and "sprida" depends on it (modal verb). "sig" is related to "sprida."
* **Refinement:**  "sprida" is the main verb, and "kunde" is a modal auxiliary verb modifying it. So, "kunde" depends on "sprida."  "sig" is the reflexive object of "sprida," so it depends on "sprida."

By following these steps, carefully considering the grammatical roles of words, and iteratively refining the relationships, we arrive at the correct dependency tree and can calculate the average dependency distance. Tools like dependency parsers can automate this, but understanding the underlying principles is key for manual analysis.

    tokens = [(i + 1, token) for i, token in enumerate(sentence.split())]

    return dependencies, average_distance

sentence = "Sjukdomar kunde sprida sig väldigt snabbt så när besättningen märkte att någon började bli sjuk så kastade man de överbord, det spelade ingen roll om de var levande eller döda."

**Explanation of the Dependency Tree:**

The output is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a dependency relation: `(dependent_index, dependent_token, head_index)`.

* **0 as Head:** A head index of `0` indicates the root of a clause or the main verb of the sentence.
* **Dependencies:** The arrows in a visual dependency tree would point from the head to the dependent. For example, `(1, 'Sjukdomar', 2)` means "Sjukdomar" depends on "kunde".
* **Clause Structure:** The sentence is complex with multiple clauses connected by conjunctions. The analysis attempts to capture these connections.
* **Punctuation:** Punctuation marks are included as tokens and are typically dependent on the main verb of the clause they belong to.
* **Subject-Verb-Object:** Basic grammatical relationships are represented, such as the subject depending on the verb, and the object depending on the verb.
* **Modifiers:** Adverbs and adjectives are shown as dependent on the words they modify.
* **Conjunctions:** Conjunctions are often linked to the head of the clause they introduce or connect.

**Average Dependency Distance:**

The average dependency distance is calculated by:

1. Finding the absolute difference between the index of the dependent and its head for each dependency.
2. Summing up these distances.
3. Dividing the sum by the total number of dependencies.

This metric gives an indication of how "long-distance" the dependencies are in the sentence. A lower average distance generally suggests a more tree-like structure with shorter dependencies, while a higher distance might indicate more complex sentence structures with dependencies spanning across clauses.

**Important Note:**

This analysis is based on a simplified understanding of dependency grammar and is done manually. A proper linguistic analysis might yield slightly different results depending on the specific dependency grammar framework used. Tools like spaCy or UDPipe, which are trained on large corpora, would provide more robust and accurate dependency parses. This manual analysis is intended for understanding the basic principles of dependency parsing.
