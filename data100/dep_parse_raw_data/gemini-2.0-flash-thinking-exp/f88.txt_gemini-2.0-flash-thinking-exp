Here's a breakdown of the thought process to generate the dependency tree and calculate the average dependency distance:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The main tasks are to create a dependency tree representation of the Swedish sentence and then calculate the average dependency distance. The output format for the tree is specified.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence down into individual tokens. This involves identifying words and punctuation marks.

   *  *Initial thought:*  Simply split on spaces.
   *  *Refinement:* Realize punctuation also needs to be treated as individual tokens. So, commas, periods, etc., are separate tokens.

3. **Dependency Parsing (Conceptual):**  This is the core of the task. It involves identifying the head (governor) of each token and the dependency relation between them (though the output format only requires the head's index). This requires understanding Swedish grammar.

   *  *Key Concepts:* Subject, verb, object, modifiers, conjunctions, prepositions, etc. Identifying the main verb is crucial.

4. **Dependency Parsing (Step-by-Step - likely internal process):**  Process the sentence token by token, deciding the head for each. This often involves working from the core of clauses outwards.

   *  "Som":  Modifier of "är".
   *  "sagt": Participle modifying the implied subject of "är". Since there's no explicit subject for this part, and it relates to the overall statement, it can be argued it modifies the main verb later, or is subordinate to "är". Let's make it dependent on "är".
   *  "så":  Adverbial modifier of "är".
   *  "är": This is a main verb in the first part of the sentence. It will be the head of several other words in this clause.
   *  "det":  The subject of "är".
   *  "något":  The subject complement of "är".
   *  "som": Relative pronoun, dependent on "något".
   *  "intresserar": Verb in the relative clause, headed by "något".
   *  "mig": Object of "intresserar".
   *  "mycket": Adverbial modifier of "intresserar".
   *  "och": Coordinating conjunction, linking the two main clauses. The second clause's main verb will be the head.
   *  "jag": Subject of the second clause's main verb "tycker".
   *  "tycker": Main verb of the second clause.
   *  "det":  Object clause complement of "tycker".
   *  "är": Verb within the object clause.
   *  "väldigt": Adverbial modifier of "viktigt".
   *  "viktigt": Subject complement of "är" within the object clause.
   *  "att": Subordinating conjunction introducing the subordinate clause. It's often attached to the verb it introduces (or a related verb like "viktigt").
   *  "vi": Subject of "hjälps".
   *  "i": Preposition.
   *  "framtiden": Object of "i".
   *  "hjälps": Verb in the subordinate clause.
   *  "åt": Particle associated with "hjälps".
   *  "med": Preposition.
   *  "att": (Infinitive marker)  Associated with "förebygga".
   *  "förebygga": Infinitive verb, object of "med".
   *  "kränkningar": Object of "förebygga".
   *  "av": Preposition.
   *  "de": Determiner modifying "mänskliga rättigheterna".
   *  "mänskliga": Adjective modifying "rättigheterna".
   *  "rättigheterna": Object of "av".
   *  ".": Punctuation, typically attached to the main verb of the sentence.

5. **Assign Indices:**  Once the dependencies are clear, assign a unique index to each token, starting from 1.

6. **Generate Dependency Tree Output:**  Iterate through the tokens and create the triples in the specified format: `(token_index, token, head_index)`.

7. **Calculate Dependency Distance:**

   *  For each token (except the root), find the absolute difference between its index and the index of its head.
   *  Sum these distances.
   *  Divide the sum by the total number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens minus 1, as the root has no head).

8. **Review and Refine:**  Double-check the dependencies, especially for more complex parts of the sentence. Ensure the output format is correct. For example, consider alternative attachments and choose the most grammatically sound interpretation. Think about cases like "Som sagt" - is "sagt" directly modifying the main verb or subordinate to "är"?  In this case, attaching "sagt" to "är" seems reasonable.

By following these steps, combining linguistic knowledge with a systematic approach, the correct dependency tree and average distance can be calculated.
```
[(1, Som, 5), (2, sagt, 1), (3, så, 5), (4, är, 5), (5, det, 13), (6, något, 5), (7, som, 8), (8, intresserar, 6), (9, mig, 8), (10, mycket, 8), (11, och, 13), (12, jag, 13), (13, tycker, 0), (14, det, 15), (15, är, 13), (16, väldigt, 17), (17, viktigt, 15), (18, att, 22), (19, vi, 22), (20, i, 22), (21, framtiden, 20), (22, hjälps, 17), (23, åt, 22), (24, med, 22), (25, att, 26), (26, förebygga, 24), (27, kränkningar, 26), (28, av, 27), (29, de, 32), (30, mänskliga, 32), (31, rättigheterna, 28), (32, ., 13)]
```

**Average Dependency Distance Calculation:**

To calculate the average dependency distance, we sum the absolute differences between the index of each token and its head, and then divide by the total number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens minus 1, as the root has no head).

1. **Calculate the distances:**
   * |1 - 5| = 4
   * |2 - 1| = 1
   * |3 - 5| = 2
   * |4 - 5| = 1
   * |5 - 13| = 8
   * |6 - 5| = 1
   * |7 - 8| = 1
   * |8 - 6| = 2
   * |9 - 8| = 1
   * |10 - 8| = 2
   * |11 - 13| = 2
   * |12 - 13| = 1
   * |14 - 15| = 1
   * |15 - 13| = 2
   * |16 - 17| = 1
   * |17 - 15| = 2
   * |18 - 22| = 4
   * |19 - 22| = 3
   * |20 - 22| = 2
   * |21 - 20| = 1
   * |22 - 17| = 5
   * |23 - 22| = 1
   * |24 - 22| = 2
   * |25 - 26| = 1
   * |26 - 24| = 2
   * |27 - 26| = 1
   * |28 - 27| = 1
   * |29 - 32| = 3
   * |30 - 32| = 2
   * |31 - 28| = 3
   * |32 - 13| = 19

2. **Sum the distances:** 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 19 = 73

3. **Count the number of dependencies:** There are 32 tokens, so there are 31 dependencies.

4. **Calculate the average dependency distance:** 73 / 31 ≈ 2.35

**Therefore, the average dependency distance for the sentence is approximately 2.35.**
