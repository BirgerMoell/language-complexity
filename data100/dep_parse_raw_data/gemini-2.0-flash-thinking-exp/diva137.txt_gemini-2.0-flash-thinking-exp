Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence and generate the dependency tree:

1. **Understanding the Request:** The request asks for a dependency tree representation of a Swedish sentence, following a specific output format, and the calculation of the average dependency distance. Key elements include tokenization, dependency parsing, and distance calculation.

2. **Tokenization:**  The first step is to break the sentence down into individual tokens. This involves identifying word boundaries and treating punctuation as separate tokens. The given sentence includes numbers, abbreviations, and standard words, which are all treated as individual units. The provided sentence is already conveniently tokenized with index numbers at the beginning of each token, which simplifies this step.

3. **Dependency Parsing (The Core Challenge):** This is the most complex part. I need to determine the grammatical relationships between the tokens. This requires knowledge of Swedish grammar. I'll go through the sentence token by token and try to identify the head of each token.

    * **2:** This number likely modifies the following noun phrase. It's hard to say definitively without more context, but given the numerical pattern, it's probably a quantity.
    * **92:** Similar to '2', likely a quantity modifying the following noun.
    * **hela:**  Means "whole" or "entire". It modifies the noun phrase "omr".
    * **omr:**  An abbreviation, likely for "område" (area). This seems to be a core noun.
    * **,:** Punctuation, its head is usually the head of the phrase it separates.
    * **55:**  Another quantity.
    * **st:**  Short for "stycken" (pieces/units). Modifies the preceding quantity and likely relates to the following noun phrase.
    * **92:** Another quantity modifying "hela omr". It seems this is repeating or specifying multiple instances.
    * **hela:** Modifying "omr".
    * **omr:** Another instance of the noun.
    * **,:** Punctuation, its head is usually the head of the phrase it separates.
    * **100:** Another quantity.
    * **st:** Short for "stycken".
    * **Radhus:**  Means "townhouse". This seems like a significant noun.
    * **Del:** Means "part". Likely modifies "Radhus".
    * **1:** A number, likely specifying which part. Modifies "Del".
    * **Radhus:**  Another instance of "townhouse". This likely relates to the preceding "Radhus Del 1". Given the structure, it seems like the second "Radhus" might be the main topic.
    * **Lukt:** Means "smell". This appears to be the subject of a clause.
    * **i:** A preposition, meaning "in".
    * **flera:** Means "several". Modifies "lgh".
    * **lgh:** Short for "lägenhet" (apartment).
    * **1:** A number, likely an identifier.

4. **Identifying Heads and Forming Triples:**  Now, I'll go back through the tokenized sentence and explicitly link each token to its head:

    * **2:** Modifies "92". (1, 2, 2)
    * **92:** Modifies "omr". (2, 92, 4)
    * **hela:** Modifies "omr". (3, hela, 4)
    * **omr:** Seems to be a core element in the first part. It's likely a constituent of a larger implied structure. The comma suggests a break. Let's tentatively make it a root for this phrase segment. (4, omr, 0)  *Correction: On closer inspection, the repeated pattern suggests "omr" is likely being modified by the quantities.* Let's link "omr" to the second "92" which appears to be the main identifier in this repetitive structure.
    * **,:** Connects to the head of the preceding phrase, which we are still figuring out.
    * **55:** Modifies "st". (6, 55, 7)
    * **st:** Modifies "92". (7, st, 8)
    * **92:** Modifies "omr". (8, 92, 10)
    * **hela:** Modifies "omr". (9, hela, 10)
    * **omr:**  Likely connected to the overall structure. Given the second comma, this whole section seems like a list or a description. Let's connect it back to the first "omr" for now to show the parallel structure. (10, omr, 4) *Correction: It makes more sense for the quantities to modify "omr" directly. The comma likely attaches to the main clause later.*
    * **,:**  Connects to the head of the previous phrase, which is still unclear in the larger context.
    * **100:** Modifies "st". (12, 100, 13)
    * **st:** Modifies "Radhus". (13, st, 14)
    * **Radhus:** This seems like the main topic. Let's tentatively make this a root for the second part. (14, Radhus, 0) *Correction:  The flow suggests the second "Radhus" is the primary noun.*
    * **Del:** Modifies "Radhus". (15, Del, 16)
    * **1:** Modifies "Del". (16, 1, 15)
    * **Radhus:**  Likely the subject of the next part of the sentence. It seems the previous part is describing something *about* this "Radhus". So, "Radhus" is the head here. (17, Radhus, 18)
    * **Lukt:** The subject of the sentence/clause. (18, Lukt, 0) *Correction: "Lukt" is the subject of the clause, but what's the verb?  There isn't an explicit verb. In such cases, we might consider an implicit "is" or link it to the most prominent noun which seems to be the second "Radhus" described earlier.* Let's try linking it to the second "Radhus" as it seems to be describing a characteristic.
    * **i:**  Preposition, modifies "lgh". (19, i, 20)
    * **flera:** Modifies "lgh". (20, flera, 21)
    * **lgh:** Object of the preposition "i". (21, lgh, 19)
    * **1:** Seems like an identifier, potentially for "lgh". (22, 1, 21)
    * **.:** Punctuation, attached to the root of the sentence/clause.

5. **Revisiting and Refining:** The initial linking might have some errors. I need to ensure the dependencies make grammatical sense in Swedish. The repetition and the lack of an explicit verb make this tricky. The second "Radhus" seems to be the central element being described. Let's adjust the links based on this.

    * **2:** Modifies "92". (1, 2, 2)
    * **92:** Modifies "omr". (2, 92, 4)
    * **hela:** Modifies "omr". (3, hela, 4)
    * **omr:** Connects to the second "92" in the series, suggesting a repeated measurement. (4, omr, 8)
    * **,:** Connects to the following quantity phrase (55 st). (5, ,, 6)
    * **55:** Modifies "st". (6, 55, 7)
    * **st:** Modifies "92". (7, st, 8)
    * **92:** Modifies "omr". (8, 92, 10)
    * **hela:** Modifies "omr". (9, hela, 10)
    * **omr:** Connects to the "Radhus" description. (10, omr, 14)
    * **,:** Connects the quantity phrase to the noun phrase. (11, ,, 12)
    * **100:** Modifies "st". (12, 100, 13)
    * **st:** Modifies "Radhus". (13, st, 14)
    * **Radhus:**  The head of the "Radhus Del 1" phrase. (14, Radhus, 17)
    * **Del:** Modifies "Radhus". (15, Del, 14)
    * **1:** Modifies "Del". (16, 1, 15)
    * **Radhus:** The main noun being described. (17, Radhus, 0)
    * **Lukt:**  Describes the "Radhus". (18, Lukt, 17)
    * **i:**  Modifies "Lukt", indicating location. (19, i, 18)
    * **flera:** Modifies "lgh". (20, flera, 21)
    * **lgh:**  Object of the preposition "i". (21, lgh, 19)
    * **1:** Modifies "lgh". (22, 1, 21)
    * **.:** Connects to the root. (23, ., 17)

6. **Calculating Average Dependency Distance:** Once the dependency tree is formed, calculate the distance for each dependency (absolute difference between head and dependent indices) and then average them.

    * |2 - 1| = 1
    * |4 - 2| = 2
    * |4 - 3| = 1
    * |8 - 4| = 4
    * |6 - 5| = 1
    * |7 - 6| = 1
    * |8 - 7| = 1
    * |10 - 8| = 2
    * |10 - 9| = 1
    * |14 - 10| = 4
    * |12 - 11| = 1
    * |13 - 12| = 1
    * |14 - 13| = 1
    * |17 - 14| = 3
    * |14 - 15| = 1
    * |15 - 16| = 1
    * |0 - 17| = 17
    * |17 - 18| = 1
    * |18 - 19| = 1
    * |21 - 20| = 1
    * |19 - 21| = 2
    * |21 - 22| = 1
    * |17 - 23| = 6

    Sum of distances = 1 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 17 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 6 = 52
    Number of dependencies = 23
    Average distance = 52 / 23 = 2.26 (approximately)

7. **Final Check and Output Formatting:** Ensure the output matches the specified format and that all tokens are included.

```
[(1, 2, 2),
 (2, 92, 4),
 (3, hela, 4),
 (4, omr, 0),
 (5, ,, 4),
 (6, 55, 7),

* **(2, 92, 4):** The quantity '92' modifies 'omr'.
* **(3, hela, 4):** The adjective 'hela' modifies 'omr'.
* **(4, omr, 0):**  The noun 'omr' acts as a head for the first part of the description. We can consider it a root for this fragment.
* **(5, ,, 4):** The comma connects to the main noun of the preceding phrase, 'omr'.
* **(6, 55, 7):** The quantity '55' modifies 'st'.

* **(16, 1, 15):** The number '1' modifies 'Del'.
* **(17, Radhus, 18):** This 'Radhus' acts as the main subject of the sentence fragment describing the "Lukt".
* **(18, Lukt, 0):** The noun 'Lukt' (smell) acts as a head or root for the second part of the sentence.
* **(19, i, 18):** The preposition 'i' modifies 'Lukt', indicating location.
* **(20, flera, 21):** The adjective 'flera' modifies 'lgh'.
* **(21, lgh, 19):** The noun 'lgh' is the object of the preposition 'i'.
* **(22, 1, 21):** The number '1' modifies 'lgh'.
* **(23, ., 18):** The full stop attaches to the main clause/phrase, headed by 'Lukt'.

**Average Dependency Distance:**

To calculate the average dependency distance, we sum the absolute differences between the head and dependent indices for each dependency and then divide by the total number of dependencies.

| Dependent Index | Head Index | Distance |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 2 | 1 |
| 2 | 4 | 2 |
| 3 | 4 | 1 |
| 4 | 0 | 4 |
| 5 | 4 | 1 |
| 6 | 7 | 1 |
| 7 | 8 | 1 |
| 8 | 10 | 2 |
| 9 | 10 | 1 |
| 10 | 4 | 6 |
| 11 | 10 | 1 |
| 12 | 13 | 1 |
| 13 | 14 | 1 |
| 14 | 17 | 3 |
| 15 | 14 | 1 |
| 16 | 15 | 1 |
| 17 | 18 | 1 |
| 18 | 0 | 18 |
| 19 | 18 | 1 |
| 20 | 21 | 1 |
| 21 | 19 | 2 |
| 22 | 21 | 1 |
| 23 | 18 | 5 |
| **Total** |  | **56** |

**Number of dependencies = 23**

**Average Dependency Distance = 56 / 23 ≈ 2.43**

**Therefore, the average dependency distance for the sentence is approximately 2.43.**
