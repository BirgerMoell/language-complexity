Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence and generate the dependency tree:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The request asks for a dependency tree representation and the average dependency distance of a given Swedish sentence. The output format for the tree is specified.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence down into individual tokens. This involves identifying words and punctuation marks as separate units. Crucially, conjunctions and prepositions should also be treated as individual tokens.

    * *Initial Tokenization (Mental or scratchpad):* Mäklarbranschens, anseende, försämrades, ,, och, för, att, motverka, detta, bildades, en, arbetsgrupp, av, fastighetsmäklare, från, olika, mäklarföretag, i, Stockholms, innerstad, .

3. **Dependency Parsing (The Core Challenge):** This is the most complex part. The goal is to identify the head (governor) of each token. This requires understanding grammatical relationships. I'll proceed token by token and consider potential heads. It's often helpful to start with the main verb.

    * **`försämrades` (worsened):** This is the main verb, so its head is 0 (the root).
    * **`Mäklarbranschens` (the real estate industry's):**  This modifies `anseende`, indicating possession. So, the head of `Mäklarbranschens` is `anseende`.
    * **`anseende` (reputation):** This is the subject of `försämrades`. So, the head of `anseende` is `försämrades`.
    * **`,` (comma):**  Punctuation often attaches to the main verb of the clause it separates. Here, it separates the first clause. So, the head is `försämrades`.
    * **`och` (and):** This is a coordinating conjunction, connecting clauses. Its head is usually the main verb of the *second* clause it connects. In this case, it's `bildades`.
    * **`för` (in order to):** This starts an infinitive clause of purpose. It modifies the verb `bildades`.
    * **`att` (to):**  This is part of the infinitive marker "för att". It depends on `motverka`.
    * **`motverka` (to counteract):** This is the infinitive verb. Its head is `för`.
    * **`detta` (this):** This is the object of `motverka`.
    * **`bildades` (was formed):** This is the main verb of the second clause. Its head is 0 (the root, as it's coordinated with the first clause).
    * **`en` (a):** This is a determiner modifying `arbetsgrupp`.
    * **`arbetsgrupp` (working group):** This is the subject of `bildades`.
    * **`av` (of):** This is a preposition introducing a prepositional phrase modifying `arbetsgrupp`.
    * **`fastighetsmäklare` (real estate agents):** This is the object of the preposition `av`.
    * **`från` (from):** This is a preposition introducing a prepositional phrase modifying `fastighetsmäklare`.
    * **`olika` (various):** This modifies `mäklarföretag`.
    * **`mäklarföretag` (real estate companies):** This is the object of the preposition `från`.
    * **`i` (in):** This is a preposition introducing a prepositional phrase modifying `mäklarföretag`.
    * **`Stockholms` (Stockholm's):** This modifies `innerstad`, showing possession.
    * **`innerstad` (inner city):** This is the object of the preposition `i`.
    * **`.` (period):** This attaches to the main verb of the sentence (the second one since it's the end of the sentence).

4. **Assemble the Dependency Tree (Applying the Decisions):**  Now, translate the head-dependent relationships into the specified output format: `(token_index, token, head_index)`. Keep track of the token index as you go.

    * (1, Mäklarbranschens, 2)
    * (2, anseende, 3)
    * (3, försämrades, 0)
    * (4, ,, 3)
    * (5, och, 10)
    * (6, för, 10)
    * (7, att, 8)
    * (8, motverka, 6)
    * (9, detta, 8)
    * (10, bildades, 0)
    * (11, en, 12)
    * (12, arbetsgrupp, 10)
    * (13, av, 12)
    * (14, fastighetsmäklare, 13)
    * (15, från, 14)
    * (16, olika, 17)
    * (17, mäklarföretag, 15)
    * (18, i, 17)
    * (19, Stockholms, 20)
    * (20, innerstad, 18)
    * (21, ., 10)

5. **Calculate Dependency Distances:**  For each token (except the root), calculate the absolute difference between the token's index and its head's index.

    * |1 - 2| = 1
    * |2 - 3| = 1
    * |3 - 0| = 3
    * |4 - 3| = 1
    * |5 - 10| = 5
    * |6 - 10| = 4
    * |7 - 8| = 1
    * |8 - 6| = 2
    * |9 - 8| = 1
    * |10 - 0| = 10
    * |11 - 12| = 1
    * |12 - 10| = 2
    * |13 - 12| = 1
    * |14 - 13| = 1
    * |15 - 14| = 1
    * |16 - 17| = 1
    * |17 - 15| = 2
    * |18 - 17| = 1
    * |19 - 20| = 1
    * |20 - 18| = 2
    * |21 - 10| = 11

6. **Compute Average Dependency Distance:** Sum the dependency distances and divide by the number of tokens (excluding the root, which has no incoming dependency).

    * Sum = 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 11 = 52
    * Number of tokens (excluding root) = 21
    * Average = 52 / 21 ≈ 2.48

7. **Format the Output:** Present the dependency tree and the average dependency distance as requested.

This thought process combines linguistic knowledge with a systematic approach to build the dependency tree and calculate the average distance. It involves breaking down the complex task into smaller, manageable steps. Trial and error and double-checking grammatical relationships are often part of the manual dependency parsing process.

**Average Dependency Distance Calculation:**

To calculate the average dependency distance, we need to find the absolute difference between the index of each token and the index of its head.

* |1 - 2| = 1
* |2 - 3| = 1
* |3 - 0| = 3
* |4 - 3| = 1
* |5 - 10| = 5
* |6 - 10| = 4
* |7 - 8| = 1
* |8 - 6| = 2
* |9 - 8| = 1
* |10 - 3| = 7
* |11 - 12| = 1
* |12 - 10| = 2
* |13 - 12| = 1
* |14 - 13| = 1
* |15 - 14| = 1
* |16 - 17| = 1
* |17 - 15| = 2
* |18 - 17| = 1
* |19 - 20| = 1
* |20 - 18| = 2
* |21 - 10| = 11

Sum of dependency distances = 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 11 = 52

Number of tokens (excluding the root which has no head) = 21

Average dependency distance = Sum of dependency distances / Number of tokens
Average dependency distance = 52 / 21 ≈ 2.48

**Average dependency distance: 2.48**
