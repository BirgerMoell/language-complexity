Here's a breakdown of the thought process to arrive at the dependency tree and average dependency distance for the given Swedish sentence:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The primary goal is to create a dependency tree representation and calculate the average dependency distance. This means identifying the head-dependent relationships between words in the sentence.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence into individual tokens. This is straightforward:

   * När
   * de
   * ska
   * leva
   * tillsammans
   * i
   * ett
   * samhälle
   * skapas
   * det
   * därför
   * problem
   * eftersom
   * de
   * uppfattar
   * verkligheten
   * olika
   * .

3. **Identify the Root:** The root of the dependency tree is usually the main verb of the main clause. In this sentence, the main clause seems to be "skapas det därför problem."  The verb "skapas" (is created) appears to be the central action. So, "skapas" is a likely candidate for the root (head with index 0).

4. **Analyze Clause Structure and Connectors:**  The sentence has multiple clauses connected by conjunctions. Identifying these connections is crucial for building the tree:

   * **"När de ska leva tillsammans i ett samhälle"**: This is a subordinate clause introduced by the temporal conjunction "När" (when). The core of this clause is "de ska leva" (they shall live). "leva" is the main verb here.
   * **"eftersom de uppfattar verkligheten olika"**: This is another subordinate clause, explaining the *reason* why problems arise, introduced by the conjunction "eftersom" (because). The core is "de uppfattar verkligheten" (they perceive reality). "uppfattar" is the main verb here.
   * **"skapas det därför problem"**: This is the main clause.

5. **Establish Head-Dependent Relationships within the Subordinate Clauses:**

   * **"När de ska leva tillsammans i ett samhälle"**:
      * "När" modifies the entire clause, so it likely attaches to the main verb "leva".
      * "de" is the subject of "leva".
      * "ska" is an auxiliary verb to "leva".
      * "tillsammans" modifies "leva", indicating *how* they live.
      * "i" is a preposition introducing the prepositional phrase "ett samhälle".
      * "ett" is a determiner modifying "samhälle". "samhälle" is the object of the preposition "i".

   * **"eftersom de uppfattar verkligheten olika"**:
      * "eftersom" connects this clause to the main clause, attaching to the verb of the main clause "skapas".
      * "de" is the subject of "uppfattar".
      * "verkligheten" is the object of "uppfattar".
      * "olika" modifies "uppfattar", describing *how* they perceive reality.

6. **Establish Head-Dependent Relationships within the Main Clause:**

   * "skapas" is the root (head 0).
   * "det" is a formal subject (expletive) and likely depends on "skapas".
   * "därför" is an adverbial modifying "skapas".
   * "problem" is the subject of the passive verb "skapas".

7. **Connect the Subordinate Clauses to the Main Clause:**

   * The "När" clause describes the *time* or *condition* under which problems are created, so its main verb "leva" likely modifies "skapas".
   * The "eftersom" clause provides the *reason* for the problem, so its main verb "uppfattar" likely modifies "skapas".

8. **Assign Indices and Create Triples:** Now, go through each token and create the (index, token, head_index) triples based on the identified dependencies.

9. **Calculate Dependency Distances:** For each triple, calculate the absolute difference between the head index and the dependent index.

10. **Calculate Average Dependency Distance:** Sum the dependency distances and divide by the total number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens minus one, or the number of non-root nodes).

**Self-Correction/Refinement During the Process:**

* **Initial thought:**  Could "leva" be the root if we consider the first part a main clause?  **Correction:** The presence of "skapas" later with a clear subject ("problem") makes it more likely to be the main verb of the sentence's primary assertion. The "När" clearly indicates a subordinate clause.
* **Placement of "därför":** Is it modifying "skapas" or "problem"? **Correction:** "därför" acts as an adverbial, modifying the verb "skapas" to indicate the consequence.
* **Connecting the clauses:** Should the conjunctions attach to the main verb or the subordinate verb? **Correction:** Conjunctions typically attach to the verb of the clause they introduce, while the subordinate clause itself modifies the main clause's verb.

By following these steps, and with some linguistic intuition about Swedish grammar, the correct dependency tree and average dependency distance can be derived.

    total_distance = 0
    for dep in dependencies:
        total_distance += abs(dep[0] - dep[2])

    average_distance = total_distance / len(dependencies) if dependencies else 0

    return dependencies, average_distance

sentence = "När de ska leva tillsammans i ett samhälle skapas det därför problem eftersom de uppfattar verkligheten olika."
dependency_tree, avg_distance = analyze_swedish_sentence(sentence)

print(dependency_tree)
print(f"Average dependency distance: {avg_distance}")
```

**Explanation of the Dependency Tree:**

Here's a breakdown of the dependency relations I've identified in the output:

* **(1, När, 4):** "När" (When) depends on "leva" (live), indicating a temporal relationship.
* **(2, de, 4):** "de" (they) is the subject of "leva".
* **(3, ska, 4):** "ska" (shall) is an auxiliary verb for "leva".
* **(4, leva, 9):** "leva" (live) depends on "skapas" (is created), indicating the circumstance under which something is created.
* **(5, tillsammans, 4):** "tillsammans" (together) modifies "leva".
* **(6, i, 8):** "i" (in) is a preposition that heads the prepositional phrase.
* **(7, ett, 8):** "ett" (a) is a determiner modifying "samhälle".
* **(8, samhälle, 4):** "samhälle" (society) is the object of the preposition "i" and modifies "leva".
* **(9, skapas, 0):** "skapas" (is created) is the root of the main clause.
* **(10, det, 9):** "det" (it/there) is an expletive subject for "skapas".
* **(11, därför, 9):** "därför" (therefore) is an adverbial modifier of "skapas".
* **(12, problem, 9):** "problem" (problems) is the subject of the passive verb "skapas".
* **(13, eftersom, 15):** "eftersom" (because) introduces a subordinate clause and depends on its main verb "uppfattar".
* **(14, de, 15):** "de" (they) is the subject of "uppfattar".
* **(15, uppfattar, 9):** "uppfattar" (perceive) depends on "skapas", explaining the reason for the creation of problems.
* **(16, verkligheten, 15):** "verkligheten" (reality) is the object of "uppfattar".
* **(17, olika, 15):** "olika" (differently) modifies "uppfattar".
* **(18, ., 9):** The full stop depends on the root verb "skapas".

**Average Dependency Distance:**

The average dependency distance calculated is the sum of the absolute differences between the head and dependent token indices, divided by the total number of dependencies.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Manual Annotation:** This analysis was done manually based on my understanding of Swedish grammar. For more complex sentences or large-scale analysis, using a dedicated dependency parser from an NLP library (like spaCy with a Swedish model or Stanza) is highly recommended. These tools are trained on large datasets and can provide more accurate and consistent dependency parses.
* **Subjectivity in Parsing:** Dependency parsing can sometimes have subjective interpretations, especially for more complex grammatical structures. Different linguists or parsers might produce slightly different trees.
* **Punctuation:** As requested, the full stop is included as a token and linked to the root verb.

This output provides a basic dependency tree representation and the average dependency distance for the given Swedish sentence. Remember that for robust and accurate parsing in real-world applications, using specialized NLP tools is crucial.
