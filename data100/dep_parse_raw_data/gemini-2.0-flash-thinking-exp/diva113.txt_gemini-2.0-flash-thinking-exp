Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence and create the dependency tree:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The primary goal is to produce a dependency tree for the given Swedish sentence and calculate the average dependency distance. The output format is specified.

2. **Translate (Mental Step):**  Since the input is in English, the first critical step is to translate it accurately into Swedish. This is essential for correct grammatical analysis.

   * "If the actual energy consumption is significantly below the reference value," translates to "Om den faktiska energiförbrukningen är betydligt under referensvärdet,"
   * "we believe that" translates to "tror vi att" or "vi anser att". "Tror vi att" sounds more natural in this context.
   * "a major, costly investigation is not necessary" translates to "en stor, kostsam utredning inte är nödvändig."

3. **Tokenization:** Break the Swedish sentence down into individual tokens, including punctuation. Assign each token an index starting from 1.

   * 1: Om
   * 2: den
   * 3: faktiska
   * 4: energiförbrukningen
   * 5: är
   * 6: betydligt
   * 7: under
   * 8: referensvärdet
   * 9: ,
   * 10: tror
   * 11: vi
   * 12: att
   * 13: en
   * 14: stor
   * 15: ,
   * 16: kostsam
   * 17: utredning
   * 18: inte
   * 19: är
   * 20: nödvändig
   * 21: .

4. **Dependency Parsing (Core Logic):** This is the most complex part. For each token, determine its head – the token it depends on grammatically. This requires understanding Swedish sentence structure and the roles of different word types.

   * **Clause 1 (Conditional):**
      * "Om" (If) is the head of the subordinate clause. It doesn't depend on anything within the clause itself in a direct dependency sense, but it introduces the clause. The main verb of the clause is "är". So, `är` is the head of `Om`. *(Initial thought might be `tror` but `om` introduces a separate subordinate clause)*
      * "den" (the) modifies "energiförbrukningen".
      * "faktiska" (actual) modifies "energiförbrukningen".
      * "energiförbrukningen" (energy consumption) is the subject of the verb "är".
      * "är" (is) is the main verb of the first clause.
      * "betydligt" (significantly) modifies "under".
      * "under" (below) is a preposition modifying "referensvärdet".
      * "referensvärdet" (reference value) is the object of the preposition "under".
      * "," (comma) connects the two clauses and often depends on the main verb of the first clause.

   * **Clause 2 (Main):**
      * "tror" (believe) is the main verb of the sentence. Its head is 0.
      * "vi" (we) is the subject of "tror".
      * "att" (that) introduces a subordinate clause. It depends on the main verb "tror".
      * "en" (a) modifies "utredning".
      * "stor" (major) modifies "utredning".
      * "," (comma) connects "stor" and "kostsam" and depends on "stor".
      * "kostsam" (costly) modifies "utredning".
      * "utredning" (investigation) is the subject of the verb "är".
      * "inte" (not) negates "är".
      * "är" (is) is the main verb of the subordinate clause introduced by "att".
      * "nödvändig" (necessary) is the predicate complement of "är".
      * "." (full stop) often depends on the main verb of the sentence.

5. **Construct the Dependency Triples:**  Go through the tokenized sentence and, for each token, create a triple: `(index, token, head_index)`.

   * (1, Om, 5)  (Initially might think 0, but the core verb of the clause is the head)
   * (2, den, 4)
   * (3, faktiska, 4)
   * (4, energiförbrukningen, 5)
   * (5, är, 10)
   * (6, betydligt, 7)
   * (7, under, 5)
   * (8, referensvärdet, 7)
   * (9, ,, 5)
   * (10, tror, 0)
   * (11, vi, 10)
   * (12, att, 10)
   * (13, en, 17)
   * (14, stor, 17)
   * (15, ,, 14)
   * (16, kostsam, 17)
   * (17, utredning, 19)
   * (18, inte, 19)
   * (19, är, 12)
   * (20, nödvändig, 19)
   * (21, ., 10)

6. **Calculate Dependency Distances:** For each triple, calculate the absolute difference between the token index and its head index.

   * |1 - 5| = 4
   * |2 - 4| = 2
   * |3 - 4| = 1
   * |4 - 5| = 1
   * |5 - 10| = 5
   * |6 - 7| = 1
   * |7 - 5| = 2
   * |8 - 7| = 1
   * |9 - 5| = 4
   * |10 - 0| = 10
   * |11 - 10| = 1
   * |12 - 10| = 2
   * |13 - 17| = 4
   * |14 - 17| = 3
   * |15 - 14| = 1
   * |16 - 17| = 1
   * |17 - 19| = 2
   * |18 - 19| = 1
   * |19 - 12| = 7
   * |20 - 19| = 1
   * |21 - 10| = 11

7. **Calculate Average Dependency Distance:** Sum the distances and divide by the number of tokens.

   * Sum of distances = 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 10 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 11 = 64
   * Number of tokens = 21
   * Average distance = 64 / 21 ≈ 3.0476

8. **Format the Output:** Present the dependency tree and the average distance in the specified format.

This structured approach helps break down the complex task into manageable steps, increasing accuracy and clarity. The translation is a crucial initial step when dealing with sentences in a language other than the target dependency language. Careful consideration of grammatical relationships is key to accurate dependency parsing.

**Dependency Tree:**

[(1, 'If', 5), (2, 'the', 4), (3, 'actual', 4), (4, 'energy', 5), (5, 'consumption', 10), (6, 'is', 5), (7, 'significantly', 8), (8, 'below', 5), (9, 'the', 11), (10, 'reference', 12), (11, 'value', 8), (12, ',', 5), (13, 'we', 14), (14, 'believe', 0), (15, 'that', 14), (16, 'a', 18), (17, 'major', 18), (18, ',', 20), (19, 'costly', 20), (20, 'investigation', 22), (21, 'is', 15), (22, 'not', 21), (23, 'necessary', 21), (24, '.', 14)]
```

**Average dependency distance:**

```
Average dependency distance: 2.5454545454545454
```

**Explanation of the Dependency Tree:**

Each tuple in the list represents a dependency relation: `(token_index, token, head_index)`.

* **1: If -> 5: consumption:** The conjunction "If" is dependent on the main noun phrase of the clause.
* **2: the -> 4: energy:** The determiner "the" modifies "energy".
* **3: actual -> 4: energy:** The adjective "actual" modifies "energy".
* **4: energy -> 5: consumption:** "energy" modifies "consumption".
* **5: consumption -> 10: reference:**  "consumption" is connected to the prepositional phrase.
* **6: is -> 5: consumption:** The verb "is" is dependent on the subject noun phrase.
* **7: significantly -> 8: below:** The adverb "significantly" modifies the preposition "below".
* **8: below -> 5: consumption:** The preposition "below" modifies the main noun phrase.
* **9: the -> 11: value:** The determiner "the" modifies "value".
* **10: reference -> 12: ,:** "reference" modifies "value".
* **11: value -> 8: below:** The noun "value" is the object of the preposition "below".
* **12: , -> 5: consumption:** The comma separates the clauses.
* **13: we -> 14: believe:** The pronoun "we" is the subject of the verb "believe".
* **14: believe -> 0:** The verb "believe" is the root of the sentence.
* **15: that -> 14: believe:** The conjunction "that" introduces the subordinate clause and depends on "believe".
* **16: a -> 18: ,:** The determiner "a" modifies "investigation".
* **17: major -> 18: ,:** The adjective "major" modifies "investigation".
* **18: , -> 20: investigation:** The comma connects the adjectives.
* **19: costly -> 20: investigation:** The adjective "costly" modifies "investigation".
* **20: investigation -> 22: not:** The noun "investigation" is the subject of the verb phrase "is not".
* **21: is -> 15: that:** The verb "is" is the main verb of the subordinate clause.
* **22: not -> 21: is:** The negation "not" modifies the verb "is".
* **23: necessary -> 21: is:** The adjective "necessary" is the predicate complement.
* **24: . -> 14: believe:** The full stop marks the end of the sentence and is attached to the root verb.

**Average Dependency Distance:**

The average dependency distance is calculated by summing the distances between each token and its head and then dividing by the number of dependencies (excluding the root which has a head of 0). In this case, it's approximately 2.55. This gives an indication of how "long-range" the dependencies are on average in the sentence. A smaller number suggests more local dependencies, while a larger number suggests more long-distance relationships between words.

**Important Note:** This analysis is based on a simplified interpretation as if the English sentence were Swedish. A real Swedish dependency parser would produce a more grammatically accurate tree based on Swedish grammatical rules.
