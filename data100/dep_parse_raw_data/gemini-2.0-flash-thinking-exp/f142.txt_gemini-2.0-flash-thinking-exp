Here's a breakdown of the thought process to arrive at the dependency tree and average distance:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The objective is to create a dependency tree for a Swedish sentence, represent it as a list of tuples (token_index, token, head_index), and calculate the average dependency distance.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break down the sentence into individual tokens. This includes words, numbers, and punctuation. Careful attention needs to be paid to correctly separating elements like "1 246 700" and treating "km²" as a single token.

3. **Dependency Parsing (Conceptual):** This is the core of the task. I need to identify the grammatical relationships between the words. For each word, I need to determine its *head* – the word it syntactically depends on. This involves applying knowledge of Swedish grammar. It's helpful to mentally visualize the sentence's structure.

4. **Iterative Dependency Assignment (Detailed Breakdown):**  I'll go through the sentence word by word and decide on the head:

    * **Det:**  This is a subject pronoun, often linked to the main verb.
    * **är:** This is the main verb (to be). It's the root of the clause. *Det* is the subject of *är*.
    * **med:** This is a preposition. Prepositions typically head noun phrases.
    * **sina:**  Possessive pronoun modifying the noun phrase.
    * **1 246 700:** Numeral modifying the unit "km²".
    * **km²:**  Noun phrase acting as the object of the preposition *med*.
    * **,:** Punctuation. Often attached to the preceding word it modifies or separates.
    * **2,7:**  Numeral modifying the comparative phrase.
    * **gånger:** Noun, part of the comparative. What is it comparing to? "stort".
    * **så:** Adverb modifying "stort".
    * **stort:** Adjective, the core of the comparative. It's linked to the verb "är".
    * **som:** Conjunction introducing the comparison. Connects to "stort".
    * **Sverige:** Noun, the object of the comparison introduced by "som".
    * **,:** Punctuation.
    * **men:** Coordinating conjunction, connecting two clauses. The head will be the main verb of the second clause.
    * **det:** Subject pronoun of the second clause.
    * **skiljer:** Main verb of the second clause.
    * **ändå:** Adverb modifying the verb "skiljer".
    * **bara:** Adverb modifying the quantity.
    * **6,5:** Numeral modifying the unit.
    * **miljoner:** Noun, the object of "skiljer".
    * **i:** Preposition, introduces a prepositional phrase specifying what is being compared.
    * **befolkning:** Noun, the object of the preposition "i".
    * **vilket:** Relative pronoun, refers back to the previous clause.
    * **betyder:** Main verb of the subordinate clause.
    * **att:** Subordinating conjunction, introduces a subordinate clause.
    * **befolkningstätheten:** Noun, subject of the subordinate clause.
    * **per:** Preposition.
    * **km²:** Noun, object of the preposition "per".
    * **är:** Verb, part of the subordinate clause.
    * **12,4:** Numeral, the value of the population density.
    * **i:** Preposition.
    * **Angola:** Noun, object of the preposition "i".
    * **medan:** Subordinating conjunction, introduces a contrasting clause.
    * **Sverige:** Noun, subject of the contrasting clause.
    * **ligger:** Verb, main verb of the contrasting clause.
    * **på:** Preposition.
    * **21,9:** Numeral, object of the preposition "på".
    * **.:** Punctuation.

5. **Assigning Head Indices:**  Now that the dependencies are identified, assign the numerical index of the head word to each token. Remember that the root verb ("är" in the first clause, "skiljer" in the second, "betyder" in the subordinate, and "ligger" in the final contrasting clause) has a head index of 0.

6. **Formatting the Output:** Create the list of tuples in the specified format: `(token_index, token, head_index)`.

7. **Calculating Dependency Distances:**
    * For each token (except the root), calculate the absolute difference between its index and its head's index.
    * Sum these distances.
    * Divide the sum by the total number of dependencies (which is the total number of tokens minus 1, as the root has no head).

8. **Double-Check:** Review the dependency tree to ensure grammatical correctness and that all tokens are included. Verify the dependency distances and the final average. For instance, ensure punctuation is correctly attached.

This structured approach, combining grammatical knowledge with careful tracking of indices, allows for accurate construction of the dependency tree and calculation of the average dependency distance.

**Explanation of the Dependency Tree:**

Each tuple in the `dependency_tree` represents a dependency relation:

* **(index, token, head_index)**
* **index:** The position of the token in the sentence (starting from 1).
* **token:** The actual word or punctuation mark.
* **head_index:** The index of the token that this token depends on. The head is the syntactic governor of the dependent. A `head_index` of `0` indicates the root of the sentence.

**Breakdown of Dependencies:**

* **(1, Det, 2):** "Det" (It) is the subject and depends on the verb "är".
* **(2, är, 0):** "är" (is) is the main verb and the root of the first clause.
* **(3, med, 6):** "med" (with) is a preposition modifying the noun phrase "sina 1 246 700 km²".
* **(4, sina, 6):** "sina" (its) is a possessive pronoun modifying "km²".
* **(5, 1 246 700, 6):** "1 246 700" is a numeral modifying "km²".
* **(6, km², 2):** "km²" (km²) is the object of the preposition "med".
* **(7, ,, 6):** The comma separates phrases and is attached to the preceding noun phrase.

* **(37, på, 36):** "på" (at/on) is a preposition modifying the verb "ligger".
* **(38, 21,9, 37):** "21,9" is the numerical value and the object of the preposition "på".
* **(39, ., 36):** The full stop ends the sentence and is attached to the main verb of the last clause.

**Average Dependency Distance Calculation:**

The average dependency distance is calculated by:

1. Finding the absolute difference between the index of each token and its head's index.
2. Summing these distances.
3. Dividing the sum by the total number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens minus 1, as the root has no head).

This provides a measure of how "long-range" the dependencies are in the sentence. A higher average distance suggests more complex sentence structure with dependencies spanning larger parts of the sentence.

**Important Note:**

This analysis and dependency tree are based on a manual interpretation of the sentence structure. For truly accurate dependency parsing, especially for complex sentences like this, it's highly recommended to use dedicated Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries like SpaCy or Stanza, which have pre-trained models for Swedish that can perform dependency parsing automatically. The provided code offers a simplified demonstration.
