Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence and create the dependency tree:

1. **Understand the Request:** The core tasks are:
    * Analyze the Swedish sentence.
    * Create a dependency tree representation.
    * Include punctuation as tokens.
    * Format the tree as a list of tuples (index, token, head_index).
    * Calculate the average dependency distance.

2. **Sentence Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence down into individual tokens. This is usually straightforward, separating words based on spaces and treating punctuation as separate tokens.

    * Demonstrationsplattformen
    * består
    * av
    * ett
    * dynamiskt
    * nätverk
    * av
    * noder
    * som
    * utbyter
    * information
    * och
    * tjänster
    * mellan
    * sig
    * .

3. **Syntactic Analysis (Dependency Parsing):** This is the most complex part. The goal is to identify the head of each word (the word it depends on grammatically). This often involves knowledge of grammar rules and sentence structure. Here's a potential thought process for each word:

    * **Demonstrationsplattformen:** This seems like the subject of the sentence. What's the main verb? "består". So, "består" is the head.
    * **består:** This is the main verb. It doesn't depend on any other word in the sentence, so its head is the root (represented by 0).
    * **av:** This is a preposition, usually modifying a noun. It likely modifies "nätverk."
    * **ett:** This is a determiner modifying "nätverk."
    * **dynamiskt:** This is an adjective modifying "nätverk."
    * **nätverk:** This is a noun and the object of the preposition "av".
    * **av:** This is a preposition, introducing another prepositional phrase. It modifies "noder".
    * **noder:** This is a noun and the object of the preposition "av."
    * **som:** This is a relative pronoun, acting as the subject of the clause "utbyter information och tjänster mellan sig." It modifies "noder."
    * **utbyter:** This is the verb of the relative clause. Its subject is "som."
    * **information:** This is one of the objects of the verb "utbyter."  The conjunction "och" usually connects elements at the same level, so "information" and "tjänster" are both objects of "utbyter."
    * **och:** This is a coordinating conjunction connecting "information" and "tjänster."  Its head is the first element it connects, "information."
    * **tjänster:** This is the other object of "utbyter."
    * **mellan:** This is a preposition modifying "utbyter" and indicating the reciprocal action.
    * **sig:** This is a reflexive pronoun and the object of the preposition "mellan."
    * **.:** Punctuation usually depends on the main verb.

4. **Constructing the Dependency Tree (Tuples):**  Now, map the identified head-dependent relationships to the required tuple format. Keep track of the token index.

    * (1, Demonstrationsplattformen, 2)  (Demonstrationsplattformen depends on består)
    * (2, består, 0)             (består is the root)
    * (3, av, 6)                (av depends on nätverk)
    * (4, ett, 6)               (ett depends on nätverk)
    * (5, dynamiskt, 6)         (dynamiskt depends on nätverk)
    * (6, nätverk, 2)             (nätverk depends on består)
    * (7, av, 8)                (av depends on noder)
    * (8, noder, 6)              (noder depends on nätverk)
    * (9, som, 10)              (som depends on utbyter)  *Initial thought, corrected below*
    * (10, utbyter, 8)            (utbyter depends on noder - the relative pronoun links back)
    * (11, information, 10)      (information depends on utbyter)
    * (12, och, 11)             (och depends on information)
    * (13, tjänster, 10)         (tjänster depends on utbyter)
    * (14, mellan, 10)           (mellan depends on utbyter)
    * (15, sig, 14)              (sig depends on mellan)
    * (16, ., 2)                 (. depends on består)

    *Correction during review*: I initially thought "som" would depend on "utbyter," but a relative pronoun usually modifies the noun it refers to, which is "noder."  Therefore, the dependency should be from "som" to "noder." This also means the head of "utbyter" is "som."

5. **Calculating Dependency Distances:** For each tuple, the dependency distance is the absolute difference between the head index and the dependent index.

    * |2 - 1| = 1
    * |0 - 2| = 2
    * |6 - 3| = 3
    * |6 - 4| = 2
    * |6 - 5| = 1
    * |2 - 6| = 4
    * |8 - 7| = 1
    * |6 - 8| = 2
    * |8 - 9| = 1
    * |8 - 10| = 2
    * |10 - 11| = 1
    * |11 - 12| = 1
    * |10 - 13| = 3
    * |10 - 14| = 4
    * |14 - 15| = 1
    * |2 - 16| = 14

6. **Calculating Average Dependency Distance:** Sum the individual distances and divide by the number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens excluding the root, or the number of tuples).

    * Total distance = 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 14 = 43
    * Number of dependencies = 16
    * Average distance = 43 / 16 = 2.6875

7. **Final Output Formatting:** Present the dependency tree and the average distance clearly.

    total_distance = 0
    for dep, token, head in dependency_tree:
        if head != 0:
            total_distance += abs(dep - head)

    average_dependency_distance = total_distance / len(dependency_tree) if len(dependency_tree) > 0 else 0

    return dependency_tree, average_dependency_distance

dependency_tree, avg_distance = analyze_swedish_sentence(sentence)

print(dependency_tree)
print(f"Average dependency distance: {avg_distance}")
```

**Explanation of the Dependency Tree:**

The dependency tree is represented as a list of tuples. Each tuple has the following structure:

`(token_index, token, head_index)`

* **token_index:** The position of the token in the sentence (starting from 1).
* **token:** The actual word or punctuation mark.
* **head_index:** The index of the token that this token depends on. The root of the sentence depends on index 0.

Here's a breakdown of the dependencies in the provided output:

* **(1, Demonstrationsplattformen, 2):** "Demonstrationsplattformen" (the demonstration platform) is the subject and depends on the verb "består".
* **(2, består, 0):** "består" (consists) is the main verb and the root of the sentence, hence it depends on 0.
* **(3, av, 6):** The preposition "av" depends on the noun "nätverk".
* **(4, ett, 6):** The determiner "ett" (a) depends on the noun "nätverk".
* **(5, dynamiskt, 6):** The adjective "dynamiskt" (dynamic) depends on the noun "nätverk".
* **(6, nätverk, 2):** The noun "nätverk" (network) is the object of the prepositional phrase and depends on the verb "består".
* **(7, av, 8):** The preposition "av" depends on the noun "noder".
* **(8, noder, 6):** The noun "noder" (nodes) is the object of the preposition and depends on "nätverk".
* **(9, som, 10):** The relative pronoun "som" (that/which) depends on the verb "utbyter".
* **(10, utbyter, 8):** The verb "utbyter" (exchanges) is the verb in the relative clause and depends on the noun it modifies, "noder".
* **(11, information, 10):** The noun "information" depends on the verb "utbyter" as its object.
* **(12, och, 11):** The conjunction "och" (and) connects "information" and "tjänster", and here it's shown depending on the first element.
* **(13, tjänster, 10):** The noun "tjänster" (services) depends on the verb "utbyter" as its object.
* **(14, mellan, 10):** The preposition "mellan" (between) depends on the verb "utbyter", indicating the manner of exchange.
* **(15, sig, 14):** The reflexive pronoun "sig" (itself/themselves) depends on the preposition "mellan".
* **(16, ., 2):** The full stop depends on the main verb "består".

**Average Dependency Distance Calculation:**

The average dependency distance is calculated as follows:

1. **Calculate the distance for each dependency:**  The absolute difference between the index of the dependent token and the index of its head.
2. **Sum the distances:** Add up all the individual dependency distances.
3. **Divide by the number of dependencies:** Divide the total distance by the number of dependency relations (which is the number of tokens minus the root, or the number of tuples with a non-zero head).

In this case, the average dependency distance is approximately **2.69**. This gives an idea of the average "distance" between related words in the sentence's grammatical structure. A smaller average distance generally indicates a more "right-branching" structure, while a larger distance might suggest more complex or embedded structures.
