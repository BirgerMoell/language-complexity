Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence and generate the dependency tree:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The request is to create a dependency tree for a Swedish sentence and calculate the average dependency distance. The output format for the dependency tree is specified.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break down the sentence into individual tokens. This includes words and punctuation. I'll go through the sentence and identify each token:

   * Afrikas
   * odlingar
   * Det
   * kan
   * vara
   * ganska
   * svårt
   * att
   * livnära
   * sig
   * på
   * växter
   * i
   * Afrika
   * ,
   * eftersom
   * det
   * är
   * så
   * torr
   * mark
   * .

3. **Assign Token Indices:** Now, assign a sequential index to each token starting from 1:

   1. Afrikas
   2. odlingar
   3. Det
   4. kan
   5. vara
   6. ganska
   7. svårt
   8. att
   9. livnära
   10. sig
   11. på
   12. växter
   13. i
   14. Afrika
   15. ,
   16. eftersom
   17. det
   18. är
   19. så
   20. torr
   21. mark
   22. .

4. **Dependency Parsing (The Core Challenge):** This is the most complex part. I need to determine the head of each token. This requires understanding the grammatical relationships between the words. I'll go through each token and consider its function in the sentence:

   * **1. Afrikas:** Genitive form, modifying "odlingar". Head is 2.
   * **2. odlingar:** Subject of the implied verb in the first part of the sentence (even though it's a fragment, we can interpret it as a topic). It's somewhat independent, but for the sake of connecting it to the main clause, we can treat it as being referenced or elaborated on by the main clause. The main verb of the following clause is "vara", so a connection there makes sense. Let's tentatively link it to "vara" (5). *Initial thought, might need adjustment.*
   * **3. Det:**  Formal subject in the main clause. Head is 5 ("vara").
   * **4. kan:** Auxiliary verb, modifying "vara". Head is 5.
   * **5. vara:** Main verb of the first clause. Head is 0 (root of the clause).
   * **6. ganska:** Adverb, modifying "svårt". Head is 7.
   * **7. svårt:** Adjective, predicative complement of "vara". Head is 5.
   * **8. att:**  Part of the infinitive marker "att livnära". Head is 9.
   * **9. livnära:**  Infinitive verb. Head is 7 (the adjective it complements).
   * **10. sig:** Reflexive pronoun, object of "livnära". Head is 9.
   * **11. på:** Preposition, introducing a prepositional phrase. Head is 9.
   * **12. växter:** Object of the preposition "på". Head is 11.
   * **13. i:** Preposition, introducing a prepositional phrase. Head is 12 (modifying "växter").
   * **14. Afrika:** Object of the preposition "i". Head is 13.
   * **15. ,:**  Punctuation, marking a clause boundary. Head is 5 (connects to the main clause).
   * **16. eftersom:** Subordinating conjunction, introducing the subordinate clause. Head is 18 (the verb of the subordinate clause).
   * **17. det:** Formal subject of the subordinate clause. Head is 18.
   * **18. är:** Main verb of the subordinate clause. Head is 5 (connecting the subordinate clause to the main).
   * **19. så:** Adverb, modifying "torr". Head is 20.
   * **20. torr:** Adjective, modifying "mark". Head is 21.
   * **21. mark:** Subject complement of "är". Head is 18.
   * **22. .:** Punctuation, marking the end of the sentence. Head is 18 (connects to the main verb of the subordinate clause as it concludes the sentence).

5. **Refine and Review Dependencies:** Let's double-check the dependencies to ensure they make grammatical sense. The connection of "odlingar" directly to "vara" might seem a bit unusual because of the initial fragment. A more nuanced analysis might connect "odlingar" more directly to the implied context, but for simplicity in this format, linking to the main verb of the following clause is a reasonable approach. The conjunction "eftersom" connects the subordinate clause to the main clause.

6. **Generate Dependency Tree Output:**  Now, format the dependencies according to the specified output: `[(token_index, token, head_index)]`

   [(1, Afrikas, 2), (2, odlingar, 5), (3, Det, 5), (4, kan, 5), (5, vara, 0), (6, ganska, 7), (7, svårt, 5), (8, att, 9), (9, livnära, 7), (10, sig, 9), (11, på, 9), (12, växter, 11), (13, i, 12), (14, Afrika, 13), (15, ,, 5), (16, eftersom, 18), (17, det, 18), (18, är, 5), (19, så, 20), (20, torr, 21), (21, mark, 18), (22, ., 18)]

7. **Calculate Dependency Distances:** For each dependency, calculate the absolute difference between the head index and the dependent index:

   * |2 - 1| = 1
   * |5 - 2| = 3
   * |5 - 3| = 2
   * |5 - 4| = 1
   * |0 - 5| = 5
   * |7 - 6| = 1
   * |5 - 7| = 2
   * |9 - 8| = 1
   * |7 - 9| = 2
   * |9 - 10| = 1
   * |9 - 11| = 2
   * |11 - 12| = 1
   * |12 - 13| = 1
   * |13 - 14| = 1
   * |5 - 15| = 10
   * |18 - 16| = 2
   * |18 - 17| = 1
   * |5 - 18| = 13
   * |20 - 19| = 1
   * |21 - 20| = 1
   * |18 - 21| = 3
   * |18 - 22| = 4

8. **Compute Average Dependency Distance:** Sum the distances and divide by the number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens excluding the root):

   Sum of distances = 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 1 + 13 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 4 = 57
   Number of dependencies = 22

   Average dependency distance = 57 / 22 ≈ 2.59

9. **Final Output:** Combine the dependency tree and the average dependency distance into the final response.
```
[(1, Afrikas, 2), (2, odlingar, 5), (3, Det, 5), (4, kan, 5), (5, vara, 0), (6, ganska, 7), (7, svårt, 5), (8, att, 9), (9, livnära, 7), (10, sig, 9), (11, på, 9), (12, växter, 11), (13, i, 12), (14, Afrika, 13), (15, ,, 5), (16, eftersom, 18), (17, det, 18), (18, är, 5), (19, så, 20), (20, torr, 21), (21, mark, 18), (22, ., 18)]
```

**Average Dependency Distance Calculation:**

To calculate the average dependency distance, we sum the absolute differences between the head and dependent token indices and then divide by the number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens excluding the root).

Dependencies and their distances:

* 1 -> 2: |2 - 1| = 1
* 2 -> 5: |5 - 2| = 3
* 3 -> 5: |5 - 3| = 2
* 4 -> 5: |5 - 4| = 1
* 5 -> 0: |0 - 5| = 5
* 6 -> 7: |7 - 6| = 1
* 7 -> 5: |5 - 7| = 2
* 8 -> 9: |9 - 8| = 1
* 9 -> 7: |7 - 9| = 2
* 10 -> 9: |9 - 10| = 1
* 11 -> 9: |9 - 11| = 2
* 12 -> 11: |11 - 12| = 1
* 13 -> 12: |12 - 13| = 1
* 14 -> 13: |13 - 14| = 1
* 15 -> 5: |5 - 15| = 10
* 16 -> 18: |18 - 16| = 2
* 17 -> 18: |18 - 17| = 1
* 18 -> 5: |5 - 18| = 13
* 19 -> 20: |20 - 19| = 1
* 20 -> 21: |21 - 20| = 1
* 21 -> 18: |18 - 21| = 3
* 22 -> 18: |18 - 22| = 4

Sum of distances = 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 1 + 13 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 4 = 57
Number of dependencies = 22

Average dependency distance = 57 / 22 ≈ **2.59**
