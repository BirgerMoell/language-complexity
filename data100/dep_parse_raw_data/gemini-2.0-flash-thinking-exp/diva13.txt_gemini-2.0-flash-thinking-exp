Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence and generate the dependency tree:

1. **Understand the Request:** The core task is to create a dependency tree for a Swedish sentence, including punctuation. The output format requires triples: (token_index, token, head_index). We also need to calculate the average dependency distance.

2. **Identify the Language:**  Although the provided sentence is in English ("This led to questions..."), the *example* is in Swedish ("Han kÃ¶per en bok"). This signals that the *target sentence* is the one to analyze, even though it's in English. This is a potential point of confusion, so double-check the prompt's intent. In this case, the prompt explicitly states "Analyze the following *Swedish* sentence," so even though the provided sentence is in English, the example clarifies the target language. *Correction:* The provided sentence *is* in English, and the example is Swedish. The request is to analyze the *provided* sentence.

3. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence down into individual tokens. This includes words and punctuation. We need to be careful with contractions and hyphenated words if present, but this sentence is relatively straightforward.

    * "This"
    * "led"
    * "to"
    * "questions"
    * "about"
    * "how"
    * "the"
    * "outbound"
    * "logistics"
    * "is"
    * "planned"
    * "in"
    * "Zwolle"
    * "today"
    * ","
    * "and"
    * "how"
    * "it"
    * "can"
    * "be"
    * "planned"
    * "in"
    * "the"
    * "future"
    * "with"
    * "increased"
    * "production"
    * "volumes"
    * "."

4. **Dependency Parsing (The Core Challenge):** This is the most complex part. We need to determine the grammatical relationships between the tokens. Since we're not using a specific NLP library here, we have to rely on grammatical knowledge.

    * **Identify the main verbs:** The sentence has two main clauses connected by "and". The first clause's main verb is "led". The second clause has a compound verb "can be planned".
    * **Identify the subjects:** The subject of "led" is "This". The subject of "can be planned" is "it".
    * **Identify objects and complements:** "led" takes "to questions" as a prepositional phrase acting as a complement. "questions" has a prepositional phrase modifying it: "about how the outbound logistics is planned in Zwolle today". The second "planned" also has prepositional phrases modifying it.
    * **Connect modifiers:** Determine how adjectives, adverbs, and prepositional phrases modify other words. For example, "outbound" modifies "logistics", "in Zwolle" modifies "planned", and "today" also modifies "planned".
    * **Handle conjunctions:** "and" connects the two main clauses.
    * **Work clause by clause:** It's often easier to parse each clause independently and then connect them.

5. **Assign Head Tokens and Create Triples:**  Once the dependencies are identified, assign the head token for each dependent token. The root of the sentence will have a head of 0. Iterate through the tokens and create the triples in the specified format.

    * **This (1):** Head is "led" (2). -> (1, This, 2)
    * **led (2):**  Root of the first clause. Head is 0. -> (2, led, 0)
    * **to (3):** Head of the prepositional phrase, modifies "led" (2). -> (3, to, 2)
    * **questions (4):** Object of the preposition "to" (3). -> (4, questions, 3)
    * **about (5):** Head of the prepositional phrase, modifies "questions" (4). -> (5, about, 4)
    * **how (6):**  Introduces a subordinate clause, dependent on "about" (5). -> (6, how, 5)
    * **the (7):** Determiner, modifies "logistics" (9). -> (7, the, 9)
    * **outbound (8):** Adjective, modifies "logistics" (9). -> (8, outbound, 9)
    * **logistics (9):** Subject of the subordinate clause, dependent on "how" (6). -> (9, logistics, 6)
    * **is (10):** Auxiliary verb, dependent on "planned" (11). -> (10, is, 11)
    * **planned (11):**  Verb in the subordinate clause, dependent on "how" (6). -> (11, planned, 6)
    * **in (12):** Head of the prepositional phrase, modifies "planned" (11). -> (12, in, 11)
    * **Zwolle (13):** Object of the preposition "in" (12). -> (13, Zwolle, 12)
    * **today (14):** Adverb, modifies "planned" (11). -> (14, today, 11)
    * **, (15):**  Punctuation, connecting clauses, often dependent on the main verb of the second clause "planned" (21). -> (15, ,, 21)
    * **and (16):** Coordinating conjunction, connects the two clauses, dependent on the first main verb "led" (2). *Correction: It connects the *verbs* "planned" in both clauses.* -> (16, and, 21)
    * **how (17):** Introduces the second subordinate clause, parallel to the first, dependent on "and" (16). *Correction: Dependent on the main verb of the second clause "planned"*. -> (17, how, 21)
    * **it (18):** Subject of the second subordinate clause, dependent on "planned" (21). -> (18, it, 21)
    * **can (19):** Modal verb, dependent on "be" (20). -> (19, can, 20)
    * **be (20):** Auxiliary verb, dependent on "planned" (21). -> (20, be, 21)
    * **planned (21):** Verb in the second subordinate clause, dependent on the implied connector from the first clause (we'll connect it to the first "planned" for simplicity, or conceptually to something higher). *Correction: Since it's coordinated, it should depend on the first main verb or something higher.* -> (21, planned, 2)  *Further refinement: Since the "how" introduces the clause, "planned" should depend on "how".* -> (21, planned, 17)
    * **in (22):** Head of the prepositional phrase, modifies "planned" (21). -> (22, in, 21)
    * **the (23):** Determiner, modifies "future" (24). -> (23, the, 24)
    * **future (24):** Object of the preposition "in" (22). -> (24, future, 22)
    * **with (25):** Head of the prepositional phrase, modifies "planned" (21). -> (25, with, 21)
    * **increased (26):** Adjective, modifies "volumes" (28). -> (26, increased, 28)
    * **production (27):** Noun, modifies "volumes" (28). -> (27, production, 28)
    * **volumes (28):** Object of the preposition "with" (25). -> (28, volumes, 25)
    * **. (29):** Punctuation, dependent on the root verb "led" (2). -> (29, ., 2)

6. **Calculate Dependency Distances:** For each triple, calculate the absolute difference between the head index and the dependent index.

    * |1 - 2| = 1
    * |2 - 0| = 2
    * |3 - 2| = 1
    * |4 - 3| = 1
    * |5 - 4| = 1
    * |6 - 5| = 1
    * |7 - 9| = 2
    * |8 - 9| = 1
    * |9 - 6| = 3
    * |10 - 11| = 1
    * |11 - 6| = 5
    * |12 - 11| = 1
    * |13 - 12| = 1
    * |14 - 11| = 3
    * |15 - 21| = 6
    * |16 - 21| = 5
    * |17 - 21| = 4
    * |18 - 21| = 3
    * |19 - 20| = 1
    * |20 - 21| = 1
    * |21 - 2| = 19  *Correction: 21 depends on 17* -> |21 - 17| = 4
    * |22 - 21| = 1
    * |23 - 24| = 1
    * |24 - 22| = 2
    * |25 - 21| = 4
    * |26 - 28| = 2
    * |27 - 28| = 1
    * |28 - 25| = 3
    * |29 - 2| = 27

7. **Compute Average Dependency Distance:** Sum the dependency distances and divide by the number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens minus 1, as the root has no head).

    Sum of distances = 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 27 = 93

    Number of dependencies = 29

    Average distance = 93 / 29 = 3.20689...

8. **Final Check and Formatting:**  Ensure the output matches the specified format and that all tokens are included. Double-check the dependency relationships for accuracy.
```
[(1, This, 2), (2, led, 0), (3, to, 2), (4, questions, 3), (5, about, 4), (6, how, 11), (7, the, 9), (8, outbound, 9), (9, logistics, 11), (10, is, 11), (11, planned, 5), (12, in, 11), (13, Zwolle, 12), (14, today, 11), (15, ,, 2), (16, and, 21), (17, how, 21), (18, it, 21), (19, can, 21), (20, be, 21), (21, planned, 2), (22, in, 21), (23, the, 24), (24, future, 22), (25, with, 21), (26, increased, 28), (27, production, 28), (28, volumes, 25), (29, ., 2)]
```

**Average Dependency Distance Calculation:**

To calculate the average dependency distance, we sum the absolute differences between the head and dependent indices for each token and then divide by the total number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens minus 1, as the root has no head).

| Token Index | Token        | Head Index | Dependency Distance |
|-------------|--------------|------------|---------------------|
| 1           | This         | 2          | |1 - 2| = 1           |
