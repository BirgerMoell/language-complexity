Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence and create the dependency tree:

1. **Understanding the Goal:** The request asks for a dependency tree representation of a Swedish sentence and the calculation of the average dependency distance. The format for the dependency tree is explicitly given.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence into individual tokens. This includes words and punctuation. I need to be careful to separate punctuation.

   * "Men"
   * "i"
   * "våra"
   * "vattendrag"
   * "måste"
   * "man"
   * "för"
   * "det"
   * "mesta"
   * "köpa"
   * "fiskekort"
   * ","
   * "Sverige"
   * "säljer"
   * "cirka"
   * "1"
   * "miljon"
   * "fiskekort"
   * "om"
   * "året"
   * "."

3. **Dependency Parsing (Conceptual):**  Now comes the core task: understanding the grammatical relationships between these tokens. I need to identify the head of each token. This requires some linguistic knowledge of Swedish grammar. I'll go through the sentence segment by segment.

   * **"Men"**: This is a conjunction. It connects the current clause to something preceding it. Since we are analyzing this sentence in isolation, it will likely be dependent on the main verb of the second clause.

   * **"i våra vattendrag"**: This is a prepositional phrase. "i" is the preposition and the head. "våra" modifies "vattendrag", so "vattendrag" is the head of "våra". The entire phrase modifies "måste" or "köpa". Since it indicates location where the buying occurs, it makes sense to attach it to the verb "måste".

   * **"måste man för det mesta köpa fiskekort"**:  This is the main clause of the first part. "måste" is the auxiliary verb and the main verb syntactically. "man" is the subject, dependent on "måste". "köpa" is the main infinitive verb, dependent on "måste". "fiskekort" is the object of "köpa". "för det mesta" is an adverbial phrase modifying "köpa". "mesta" is the head, "för" and "det" are modifiers.

   * **","**: Punctuation typically depends on the main verb of the clause it's separating. In this case, it separates the two independent clauses, so it depends on the main verb of the second clause.

   * **"Sverige säljer cirka 1 miljon fiskekort om året"**: This is the second main clause. "säljer" is the main verb. "Sverige" is the subject. "fiskekort" is the object. "cirka 1 miljon" modifies "fiskekort"; "miljon" is the head, "cirka" and "1" modify it. "om året" is an adverbial phrase modifying "säljer"; "om" is the preposition, "året" is the object of the preposition.

   * **"."**: The sentence-ending punctuation depends on the main verb of the sentence's final clause.

4. **Assigning Heads and Indices:** Now that the dependencies are conceptually identified, assign the head tokens and indices. Start with the root of each clause (the main verbs) and work outward.

   * "måste" (5) is the head of the first clause.
   * "säljer" (14) is the head of the second clause.

   Go through each token and decide which other token it depends on:

   * 1: Men -> 14 (connects the clauses)
   * 2: i -> 5 (prepositional phrase modifying the verb)
   * 3: våra -> 4
   * 4: vattendrag -> 2
   * 5: måste -> 0 (root of the first clause)
   * 6: man -> 5
   * 7: för -> 10
   * 8: det -> 10
   * 9: mesta -> 7
   * 10: köpa -> 5
   * 11: fiskekort -> 10
   * 12: , -> 14
   * 13: Sverige -> 14
   * 14: säljer -> 0 (root of the second clause)
   * 15: cirka -> 17
   * 16: 1 -> 17
   * 17: miljon -> 14
   * 18: fiskekort -> 14
   * 19: om -> 14
   * 20: året -> 19
   * 21: . -> 14

5. **Formatting the Output:** Finally, format the output as a list of tuples in the specified format: `(index, token, head_index)`. Remember that the root of each clause has a head index of 0.

6. **Calculating Average Dependency Distance:**

   * Calculate the dependency distance for each token (absolute difference between the token's index and its head's index).
   * Sum these distances.
   * Divide the sum by the total number of tokens.

   * | Token Index | Head Index | Distance |
   * |---|---|---|
   * | 1 | 14 | 13 |
   * | 2 | 5 | 3 |
   * | 3 | 4 | 1 |
   * | 4 | 2 | 2 |
   * | 5 | 0 | 5 |
   * | 6 | 5 | 1 |
   * | 7 | 10 | 3 |
   * | 8 | 10 | 2 |
   * | 9 | 7 | 2 |
   * | 10 | 5 | 5 |
   * | 11 | 10 | 1 |
   * | 12 | 14 | 2 |
   * | 13 | 14 | 1 |
   * | 14 | 0 | 14 |
   * | 15 | 17 | 2 |
   * | 16 | 17 | 1 |
   * | 17 | 14 | 3 |
   * | 18 | 14 | 4 |
   * | 19 | 14 | 5 |
   * | 20 | 19 | 1 |
   * | 21 | 14 | 7 |

   * Sum of distances = 78
   * Number of tokens = 21
   * Average distance = 78 / 21 ≈ 3.71

This systematic approach, combining grammatical understanding with careful tracking of indices, allows for the accurate creation of the dependency tree and the calculation of the average dependency distance.

[(1, Men, 14), (2, i, 5), (3, våra, 4), (4, vattendrag, 2), (5, måste, 0), (6, man, 5), (7, för, 10), (8, det, 10), (9, mesta, 7), (10, köpa, 5), (11, fiskekort, 10), (12, ,, 14), (13, Sverige, 14), (14, säljer, 0), (15, cirka, 17), (16, 1, 17), (17, miljon, 18), (18, fiskekort, 14), (19, om, 14), (20, året, 19), (21, ., 14)]
```

**Average Dependency Distance Calculation:**

To calculate the average dependency distance, we need to find the absolute difference between the index of each token and its head, sum these distances, and then divide by the total number of tokens.

| Token Index | Head Index | Dependency Distance |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 14 | |1 - 14| = 13 |
| 2 | 5 | |2 - 5| = 3 |
| 3 | 4 | |3 - 4| = 1 |
| 4 | 2 | |4 - 2| = 2 |
| 5 | 0 | |5 - 0| = 5 |
| 6 | 5 | |6 - 5| = 1 |
| 7 | 10 | |7 - 10| = 3 |
| 8 | 10 | |8 - 10| = 2 |
| 9 | 7 | |9 - 7| = 2 |
| 10 | 5 | |10 - 5| = 5 |
| 11 | 10 | |11 - 10| = 1 |
| 12 | 14 | |12 - 14| = 2 |
| 13 | 14 | |13 - 14| = 1 |
| 14 | 0 | |14 - 0| = 14 |
| 15 | 17 | |15 - 17| = 2 |
| 16 | 17 | |16 - 17| = 1 |
| 17 | 18 | |17 - 18| = 1 |
| 18 | 14 | |18 - 14| = 4 |
| 19 | 14 | |19 - 14| = 5 |
| 20 | 19 | |20 - 19| = 1 |
| 21 | 14 | |21 - 14| = 7 |

**Sum of Dependency Distances:** 13 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 5 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 5 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 14 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 5 + 1 + 7 = 76

**Total Number of Tokens:** 21

**Average Dependency Distance:** 76 / 21 ≈ 3.62

**Therefore, the average dependency distance for the sentence is approximately 3.62.**
