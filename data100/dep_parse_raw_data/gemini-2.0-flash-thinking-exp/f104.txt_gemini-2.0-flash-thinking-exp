Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence and produce the dependency tree and average dependency distance:

1. **Understand the Request:** The core task is dependency parsing and calculating the average dependency distance. The output format for the dependency tree is clearly specified. Punctuation needs to be treated as tokens.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence down into individual tokens. This involves identifying word boundaries and treating punctuation as separate tokens.
    * *Initial thought:*  Split by spaces.
    * *Refinement:* Need to handle punctuation properly. Commas, periods, slashes, and other symbols need their own tokens. Ellipses (….) should likely be a single token.

3. **Dependency Parsing (Conceptual):**  The next step is to identify the grammatical relationships between the words. This requires understanding Swedish grammar. Key questions to ask for each word:
    * What is the main verb of the clause?
    * Which words modify the verb? (Subjects, objects, adverbs)
    * Which words modify nouns? (Determiners, adjectives, prepositional phrases)
    * How do conjunctions connect clauses?

4. **Dependency Parsing (Detailed Application):**  Let's go through the sentence word by word, deciding on heads and dependents:

    * **Oftast:** An adverb modifying the verb. Head: *kommer*.
    * **så:** An adverbial particle modifying the verb. Head: *kommer*.
    * **kommer:** This is the main verb of the first clause. Head: 0 (root).
    * **virus:** The subject of the verb *kommer*. Head: *kommer*.
    * **till:** A preposition. Head: *dator*.
    * **din:** A possessive determiner modifying *dator*. Head: *dator*.
    * **dator:** The object of the preposition *till*. Head: *kommer* (indirectly through the preposition).
    * **genom:** A preposition. Head: *Internet*.
    * **Internet:** The object of the preposition *genom*. Head: *kommer* (indirectly).
    * **,:** Punctuation, likely dependent on the main verb of the clause it separates. Head: *kommer*.
    * **men:** A coordinating conjunction. It connects two clauses. It's often treated as dependent on the head of the second clause. Head: *spridas*.
    * **kan:** An auxiliary verb. Head: *spridas*.
    * **också:** An adverb modifying *spridas*. Head: *spridas*.
    * **spridas:** The main verb of the second clause. Head: *kommer* (since *men* connects them). *Correction:* The *men* connects clauses, so *spridas* is the root of the *second* clause, and *men* depends on it. The relationship to *kommer* is through coordination.
    * **över:** A preposition. Head: *lagringsmedium*.
    * **sekundära:** An adjective modifying *lagringsmedium*. Head: *lagringsmedium*.
    * **lagringsmedium:** The object of the preposition *över*. Head: *spridas* (indirectly).
    * **såsom:** A subordinator introducing examples. Head: *lagringsmedium*.
    * **disketter:** The first item in the list of examples. Head: *lagringsmedium*.
    * **,:** Separating items in the list. Head: *lagringsmedium*.
    * **CD/DVD/MD:**  Compound noun. The last part is often the head. Head: *skivor*. *Correction:*  This should probably be treated as a coordinated list with *skivor* as the head.
    * **skivor:** Part of the example list. Head: *lagringsmedium*.
    * **,:** Separating items in the list. Head: *lagringsmedium*.
    * **minnen:** Another item in the list. Head: *lagringsmedium*.
    * **ect….**: Abbreviation. Head: *lagringsmedium*.

5. **Assigning Indices:** Number the tokens sequentially starting from 1.

6. **Creating the Dependency Tree (Output Format):**  Iterate through the tokens and create the triples according to the determined heads.

7. **Calculating Dependency Distances:** For each token, calculate the absolute difference between its index and the index of its head.

8. **Calculating Average Dependency Distance:** Sum the individual dependency distances and divide by the total number of tokens (excluding the root).

9. **Review and Refine:**  Look at the generated tree and distances. Do they make grammatical sense? Are there any ambiguities or errors in the head assignments?  For example, the coordination with "men" needs careful consideration.

    * *Self-Correction Example:* Initially, I might have linked "men" to "kommer". However, "men" connects clauses, so it's better to link it to the head of the *second* clause, which is "spridas". The connection between the clauses is represented by both verbs being roots of their respective clauses (conceptually, although we only explicitly mark one root as 0).

10. **Final Output Generation:**  Present the dependency tree in the requested format and the calculated average dependency distance.

    """Analyzes a Swedish sentence and produces a dependency tree and average dependency distance."""

    tokens = [token.strip() for token in sentence.replace('…', '….').split()]  # Split and handle ellipsis

    # Compute average dependency distance
    total_distance = 0
    for head_index, _, dependent_index in dependencies:
        total_distance += abs(head_index - dependent_index)

    average_distance = total_distance / len(dependencies) if dependencies else 0

    return dependencies, average_distance

sentence = "Oftast så kommer virus till din dator genom Internet, men kan också spridas över sekundära lagringsmedium såsom disketter, CD/DVD/MD skivor, minnen ect…."
dependency_tree, avg_distance = analyze_swedish_sentence(sentence)

print(dependency_tree)
print(f"Average Dependency Distance: {avg_distance}")
```

**Explanation of the Dependency Tree:**

* **(1, "Oftast", 3):** The adverb "Oftast" (Often) modifies the verb "kommer" (comes).
* **(2, "så", 3):** The particle "så" often accompanies verbs and here modifies "kommer".
* **(3, "kommer", 0):** The verb "kommer" is the root of the main clause, hence its head is 0.
* **(4, "virus", 3):** The noun "virus" is the subject of the verb "kommer".
* **(5, "till", 7):** The preposition "till" (to) modifies the noun "dator" (computer).
* **(6, "din", 7):** The possessive pronoun "din" (your) modifies the noun "dator".
* **(7, "dator", 3):** The noun "dator" is the object of the prepositional phrase "till din dator", which modifies "kommer".
* **(8, "genom", 9):** The preposition "genom" (through) modifies the noun "Internet".
* **(9, "Internet", 7):** The noun "Internet" is the object of the prepositional phrase "genom Internet", which modifies "dator" in the context of how the virus arrives.
* **(10, ",", 3):** The comma often depends on the main verb of the clause it is in.
* **(11, "men", 14):** The conjunction "men" (but) connects the two clauses, and here we make it dependent on the verb of the second clause.
* **(12, "kan", 14):** The auxiliary verb "kan" (can) modifies the main verb "spridas" (spread).
* **(13, "också", 14):** The adverb "också" (also) modifies the verb "spridas".
* **(14, "spridas", 3):** The verb "spridas" is the main verb of the second clause, coordinated with the first. We've chosen to make it dependent on the root of the first clause for simplicity in this manual analysis. More sophisticated parsing might represent the coordination differently.
* **(15, "över", 18):** The preposition "över" (over) modifies the noun "lagringsmedium" (storage medium).
* **(16, "sekundära", 18):** The adjective "sekundära" (secondary) modifies the noun "lagringsmedium".
* **(17, "lagringsmedium", 15):**  The noun "lagringsmedium" is the object of the preposition "över".
* **(18, "såsom", 14):** The subordinator "såsom" (such as) introduces examples and depends on the verb of the clause.
* **(19, "disketter", 18):** The noun "disketter" (diskettes) is an example introduced by "såsom".
* **(20, ",", 18):** The comma separates items in the list of examples.
* **(21, "CD/DVD/MD", 22):**  This is treated as a compound noun where the last part is often the head.
* **(22, "skivor", 18):** The noun "skivor" (discs) is another example.
* **(23, ",", 18):** Another comma separating list items.
* **(24, "minnen", 18):** The noun "minnen" (memories/memory sticks) is another example.
* **(25, "ect….", 18):** The abbreviation "ect…" (etc.) indicates more examples.

**Average Dependency Distance:**

The average dependency distance is calculated by summing the absolute differences between the indices of each token and its head, and then dividing by the total number of dependencies. This gives a measure of how "long-distance" the dependencies are on average within the sentence.

**Important Note:**

This analysis is based on a manual interpretation of the sentence structure. For accurate and robust dependency parsing, especially for more complex sentences, you would typically use a dedicated Natural Language Processing (NLP) library that has been trained on large amounts of text data. Libraries like SpaCy (with Swedish language models) or Stanza would be suitable choices for this task.
