Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence and create the dependency tree:

1. **Understanding the Request:** The goal is to create a dependency tree for a Swedish sentence, representing it as a list of tuples. Each tuple contains the token index, the token, and the head token's index. Punctuation should be included as tokens. Finally, the average dependency distance needs to be calculated.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break down the sentence into individual tokens. This seems straightforward, respecting spaces and punctuation.

   * Den
   * del
   * av
   * koden
   * som
   * ger
   * order
   * om
   * andra
   * saker
   * utöver
   * att
   * sprida
   * och
   * gömma
   * sig
   * kallas
   * ”
   * payload
   * ”,
   * dvs
   * last
   * på
   * svenska
   * .

3. **Dependency Parsing (The Core Task):** This is the most complex part. The goal is to identify the head of each token. I'll go through the sentence token by token, considering the grammatical relations. It's helpful to think in terms of subject, verb, object, modifiers, etc.

   * **Den:**  This is a determiner modifying "del". Head: "del" (index 2).
   * **del:** This is the noun. It's the subject of "kallas". Head: "kallas" (index 17).
   * **av:** This is a preposition introducing a prepositional phrase modifying "del". Head: "del" (index 2).
   * **koden:** This is the object of the preposition "av". Head: "av" (index 3).
   * **som:** This is a relative pronoun referring to "koden" and introducing a relative clause. It's the subject of "ger". Head: "koden" (index 4).
   * **ger:** This is the verb within the relative clause. Head: "koden" (index 4). *Correction: "ger" should have "som" as its subject.* Head: "som" (index 5).
   * **order:** This is the object of the verb "ger". Head: "ger" (index 6).
   * **om:** This is a preposition introducing a prepositional phrase modifying "order". Head: "order" (index 7).
   * **andra:** This is an adjective modifying "saker". Head: "saker" (index 10).
   * **saker:** This is the object of the preposition "om". Head: "om" (index 8).
   * **utöver:** This is a preposition introducing a prepositional phrase modifying "ger" (or possibly "order"). Let's say it modifies "ger" for now. Head: "ger" (index 6).
   * **att:** This is a subordinator introducing an infinitive phrase. Head: "utöver" (index 11).
   * **sprida:** This is the first infinitive verb. Head: "att" (index 12).
   * **och:** This is a conjunction coordinating "sprida" and "gömma". Head: "sprida" (index 13).
   * **gömma:** This is the second infinitive verb, coordinated with "sprida". Head: "att" (index 12). *Correction: Should be coordinated with "sprida".* Head: "sprida" (index 13).
   * **sig:** This is the reflexive pronoun, the object of "gömma". Head: "gömma" (index 15).
   * **kallas:** This is the main verb of the sentence. Head: 0 (root).
   * **”:** Punctuation mark associated with "payload". Head: "payload" (index 19).
   * **payload:** This is the subject complement of "kallas". Head: "kallas" (index 17).
   * **”:** Punctuation mark associated with "payload". Head: "payload" (index 19).
   * **dvs:** This is an abbreviation introducing an explanation. It modifies "payload". Head: "payload" (index 19).
   * **last:** This is the noun explaining "payload". It is the object of the preposition "dvs" (conceptually). Head: "dvs" (index 21).
   * **på:** This is a preposition introducing a prepositional phrase modifying "last". Head: "last" (index 22).
   * **svenska:** This is the object of the preposition "på". Head: "på" (index 23).
   * **.:** Sentence terminator. Head: "kallas" (index 17).

4. **Constructing the Dependency Tree (List of Tuples):**  Now, organize the identified head-dependent relations into the required format. Double-check the indices!

5. **Calculating Average Dependency Distance:**
   * Calculate the absolute difference between the index of each token and its head.
   * Sum these distances.
   * Divide the sum by the total number of tokens.

**Self-Correction Example during the process:**  Initially, I might have incorrectly linked "ger" directly to "koden". However, realizing that "som" acts as the subject of "ger" clarifies the structure. Similarly, the coordination with "och" requires careful attention to the head of the coordinated elements. I initially had "gömma" headed by "att", but it should be coordinated with "sprida". Reviewing standard dependency parsing principles is crucial for accuracy. The relationship of "dvs" also requires some thought – it acts more like an apposition marker or introducer of an explanation.

By following these steps systematically and double-checking the relationships, the correct dependency tree and average distance can be determined.

**Explanation of the Dependency Tree:**

Each tuple in the list represents a dependency relation: `(token_index, token, head_index)`.

* **1, 'Den', 2**: The token "Den" (index 1) is a dependent of "del" (index 2). "Den" is a determiner modifying "del".
* **2, 'del', 17**: The token "del" (index 2) is a dependent of "kallas" (index 17). "del" acts as the subject of the main verb "kallas".
* **3, 'av', 2**: The token "av" (index 3) is a dependent of "del" (index 2). "av" is a preposition modifying "del".
* **4, 'koden', 3**: The token "koden" (index 4) is a dependent of "av" (index 3). "koden" is the object of the preposition "av".
* **5, 'som', 6**: The token "som" (index 5) is a dependent of "ger" (index 6). "som" is a relative pronoun acting as the subject of the verb "ger" in the relative clause.
* **6, 'ger', 4**: The token "ger" (index 6) is a dependent of "koden" (index 4). "ger" is the main verb within the relative clause modifying "koden".
* **7, 'order', 6**: The token "order" (index 7) is a dependent of "ger" (index 6). "order" is the direct object of the verb "ger".

* **11, 'utöver', 6**: The token "utöver" (index 11) is a dependent of "ger" (index 6). "utöver" acts as an adverbial modifying "ger".
* **12, 'att', 13**: The token "att" (index 12) is a dependent of "sprida" (index 13). "att" is the infinitive marker.
* **13, 'sprida', 11**: The token "sprida" (index 13) is a dependent of "utöver" (index 11). "sprida" is the infinitive verb.
* **14, 'och', 13**: The token "och" (index 14) is a dependent of "sprida" (index 13). "och" is a coordinating conjunction connecting "sprida" and "gömma".
* **15, 'gömma', 13**: The token "gömma" (index 15) is a dependent of "sprida" (index 13). "gömma" is the second infinitive verb coordinated with "sprida".
* **16, 'sig', 15**: The token "sig" (index 16) is a dependent of "gömma" (index 15). "sig" is the reflexive pronoun, the object of "gömma".
* **17, 'kallas', 0**: The token "kallas" (index 17) is the root of the sentence, with no head (represented by 0).
* **18, '”', 19**: The token "”" (index 18) is a dependent of "payload" (index 19). It's the opening quotation mark for "payload".
* **19, 'payload', 17**: The token "payload" (index 19) is a dependent of "kallas" (index 17). "payload" is the subject complement.
* **20, '”', 19**: The token "”" (index 20) is a dependent of "payload" (index 19). It's the closing quotation mark for "payload".

* **25, '.', 17**: The token "." (index 25) is a dependent of "kallas" (index 17). It's the sentence-ending punctuation.

**Average Dependency Distance:**

The average dependency distance is calculated by summing the absolute differences between the token index and its head index and dividing by the total number of tokens. In this case, it represents the average "distance" between words in the sentence according to the dependency structure.

**Important Note:**

This analysis is based on a manual interpretation of the sentence structure. For more accurate and robust dependency parsing, especially for complex sentences, it's highly recommended to use established Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries like SpaCy, Stanza, or UDPipe, which are trained on large datasets and have sophisticated models for dependency parsing in various languages, including Swedish. You would need to load a Swedish language model for these libraries to work effectively.
