Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence and generate the dependency tree:

1. **Understand the Request:** The core task is to create a dependency tree for a Swedish sentence. The output format is specified: `(token_index, token, head_index)`. Punctuation counts as tokens. Finally, calculate the average dependency distance.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence down into individual tokens. This is relatively straightforward:

   * "Stockholm"
   * ","
   * "december"
   * "2009"
   * "Patrik"
   * "Berggren"
   * "iii"
   * "Sammanfattning"
   * "Byggnadsbeståndet"
   * "i"
   * "Sverige"
   * "blir"
   * "bara"
   * "äldre"
   * "och"
   * "äldre"
   * "."

3. **Dependency Parsing (the Core Challenge):** This is where linguistic knowledge comes in. I need to identify the head of each word and the relationship between them. I'll go through the sentence token by token and determine its head.

   * **"Stockholm"**: This is a noun. It seems to be functioning as an initial element, perhaps setting the scene. It's likely a modifier or part of an initial phrase. Let's keep it in mind.

   * **","**: Punctuation usually attaches to a nearby element. In this case, it likely attaches to "Stockholm".

   * **"december"**: This is a noun (month). It modifies "Stockholm", specifying the time.

   * **"2009"**: This is a numeral, further specifying the time, and modifying "december".

   * **"Patrik"**: A proper noun. It seems like a heading or label. It doesn't immediately connect grammatically to the date information. It might be a separate part of the document structure.

   * **"Berggren"**: Another proper noun, likely the last name corresponding to "Patrik". "Berggren" depends on "Patrik".

   * **"iii"**: Roman numerals. Likely a section number or similar. Similar to the name, it seems like a structural element rather than a core part of the sentence's grammar.

   * **"Sammanfattning"**: A noun meaning "Summary". This feels like a heading or title. It's likely the main topic of what follows.

   * **"Byggnadsbeståndet"**: The definite form of "byggnadsbestånd" (building stock). This feels like the subject of the main clause.

   * **"i"**: A preposition meaning "in".

   * **"Sverige"**: A proper noun (Sweden). The object of the preposition "i".

   * **"blir"**:  The verb "to become". This is likely the main verb of the clause.

   * **"bara"**: An adverb meaning "only". It modifies "äldre".

   * **"äldre"**: An adjective meaning "older". This is the predicative adjective following "blir".

   * **"och"**: A conjunction meaning "and". It connects the two instances of "äldre".

   * **"äldre"**: Another instance of the adjective "older".

   * **"."**:  The sentence-ending punctuation. It attaches to the main verb.

4. **Assigning Heads and Indices:** Now, let's put the pieces together with specific head assignments and indices:

   * **1. Stockholm:** It seems to be related to "Sammanfattning" or could be a standalone element. Let's tentatively connect it to "Sammanfattning" as providing context. *(1, Stockholm, 8)*
   * **2. ,:**  Attaches to "Stockholm". *(2, ,, 1)*
   * **3. december:** Modifies "Stockholm". *(3, december, 1)*
   * **4. 2009:** Modifies "december". *(4, 2009, 3)*
   * **5. Patrik:** Likely a standalone element or heading. Let's consider it a child of a conceptual root for now. *(5, Patrik, 0)*  *Correction: It's better if independent elements have no head.*
   * **6. Berggren:** Modifies "Patrik". *(6, Berggren, 5)*
   * **7. iii:**  Another standalone element. *(7, iii, 0)* *Correction: Same logic as "Patrik".*
   * **8. Sammanfattning:** This looks like the central topic. It could be the root of the subsequent clause or an independent title. Given the sentence structure, the clause seems to be a continuation. Let's make it a root for its section. *(8, Sammanfattning, 0)* *Correction:  It's likely a standalone title element.*
   * **9. Byggnadsbeståndet:** The subject of the verb "blir". *(9, Byggnadsbeståndet, 12)*
   * **10. i:**  Preposition modifying "Byggnadsbeståndet". *(10, i, 9)*
   * **11. Sverige:** Object of the preposition "i". *(11, Sverige, 10)*
   * **12. blir:** The main verb. *(12, blir, 0)*
   * **13. bara:** Modifies "äldre". *(13, bara, 14)*
   * **14. äldre:** Predicative adjective, linked to "blir". *(14, äldre, 12)*
   * **15. och:** Connects the two "äldre". *(15, och, 14)*
   * **16. äldre:** Second instance of the adjective. *(16, äldre, 14)*
   * **17. .:** Attaches to the main verb. *(17, ., 12)*

5. **Refining and Checking:**  Review the dependencies. Does it make grammatical sense? Are there any inconsistencies? The headings like "Patrik Berggren" and "iii" are a bit tricky. They're not grammatically part of the main clause. Treating them as having a head of 0 seems appropriate for this context. "Sammanfattning" also behaves similarly.

6. **Calculate Dependency Distances:** Now, for each token, calculate the absolute difference between its index and its head's index.

   * |1 - 8| = 7
   * |2 - 1| = 1
   * |3 - 1| = 2
   * |4 - 3| = 1
   * |5 - 0| = 5
   * |6 - 5| = 1
   * |7 - 0| = 7
   * |8 - 0| = 8
   * |9 - 12| = 3
   * |10 - 9| = 1
   * |11 - 10| = 1
   * |12 - 0| = 12
   * |13 - 14| = 1
   * |14 - 12| = 2
   * |15 - 14| = 1
   * |16 - 14| = 2
   * |17 - 12| = 5

7. **Calculate Average Distance:** Sum the distances and divide by the number of tokens.

   7 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 7 + 8 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 12 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 60
   Average = 60 / 17 ≈ 3.53

This detailed thought process, moving from tokenization to dependency assignment and finally to distance calculation, allows for a systematic approach to the problem. The trickiest part is correctly identifying the head of each token, which requires understanding Swedish grammar.
```
[(1, Stockholm, 8), (2, ,, 1), (3, december, 1), (4, 2009, 3), (5, Patrik, 8), (6, Berggren, 5), (7, iii, 8), (8, Sammanfattning, 12), (9, Byggnadsbeståndet, 12), (10, i, 9), (11, Sverige, 10), (12, blir, 0), (13, bara, 14), (14, äldre, 12), (15, och, 14), (16, äldre, 14), (17, ., 12)]
```

**Dependency Distances:**

* Stockholm: |1 - 8| = 7
* ,: |2 - 1| = 1
* december: |3 - 1| = 2
* 2009: |4 - 3| = 1
* Patrik: |5 - 8| = 3
* Berggren: |6 - 5| = 1
* iii: |7 - 8| = 1
* Sammanfattning: |8 - 12| = 4
* Byggnadsbeståndet: |9 - 12| = 3
* i: |10 - 9| = 1
* Sverige: |11 - 10| = 1
* blir: |12 - 0| = 12
* bara: |13 - 14| = 1
* äldre: |14 - 12| = 2
* och: |15 - 14| = 1
* äldre: |16 - 14| = 2
* .: |17 - 12| = 5

**Sum of Dependency Distances:** 7 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 12 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 5 = 48

**Average Dependency Distance:** 48 / 17 ≈ 2.82
