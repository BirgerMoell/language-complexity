Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence and create the dependency tree:

1. **Understand the Task:** The core task is to create a dependency tree for a Swedish sentence and then calculate the average dependency distance. The output format is clearly specified: a list of triples (token index, token, head index).

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence down into individual tokens. This needs careful attention to punctuation.

   *  "Medlemmar:Det fanns 172 medlemmar i Jönköping vid årsskiftet och i hela Sverige cirka 2500."
   *  Tokens: "Medlemmar", ":", "Det", "fanns", "172", "medlemmar", "i", "Jönköping", "vid", "årsskiftet", "och", "i", "hela", "Sverige", "cirka", "2500", "."

3. **Dependency Parsing (Conceptual):** Now, the crucial part is figuring out the relationships between the tokens. This involves understanding the grammatical structure of the sentence. A good approach is to find the main verb and then connect other words to it.

   * **Identify the main verb:** "fanns" (there were/existed). This will be the root of the main clause (head index 0).

   * **Subject of "fanns":**  The subject is "Det" (it/there).

   * **What existed?**  "medlemmar" (members). This is the predicate nominative and modifies "Det" via "fanns".

   * **Quantifier for "medlemmar":** "172" modifies "medlemmar".

   * **Location of the members:** "i Jönköping". "i" is a preposition and "Jönköping" is its object. The prepositional phrase modifies "medlemmar".

   * **Time reference:** "vid årsskiftet". "vid" is a preposition and "årsskiftet" is its object. This modifies "fanns" (or potentially "medlemmar" but the time context makes "fanns" more likely).

   * **Conjunction:** "och" (and) connects two clauses or parts of a sentence.

   * **Second part after "och":**  This is slightly elliptical. We can infer that "fanns" is implied again. Let's analyze it independently first.

   * **Location:** "i hela Sverige". "i" is the preposition, "hela" modifies "Sverige". The prepositional phrase would modify the implied "fanns".

   * **Approximation:** "cirka" modifies the number "2500".

   * **The number:** "2500". This relates to the implied "medlemmar" in the second part.

   * **Connecting with "och":** Now, connect the second part. The core element connected by "och" is the idea of "medlemmar fanns" (members existed). So, the relationships will mirror the first part.

4. **Assigning Head Indices (Iterative Process):** Based on the conceptual dependency relationships, assign head indices. This requires going through each token and determining its head.

   * Medlemmar (1): This seems like a title or heading. It doesn't directly depend on the main clause. Let's make its head 0 for now as it's introductory.
   * : (2): Punctuation usually depends on the word it follows, so head is 1.
   * Det (3): Subject of "fanns", so head is 4.
   * fanns (4): Main verb, head is 0.
   * 172 (5): Modifies "medlemmar", head is 6.
   * medlemmar (6):  The thing that existed, depends on "fanns", head is 4.
   * i (7): Preposition modifying "Jönköping", head is 6 (modifies the noun).
   * Jönköping (8): Object of the preposition "i", head is 7.
   * vid (9): Preposition indicating time, modifying "fanns", head is 4.
   * årsskiftet (10): Object of the preposition "vid", head is 9.
   * och (11): Conjunction, often depends on the main verb of the first clause it connects, head is 4.
   * i (12): Preposition modifying "Sverige",  implied "fanns" or related to the second implied "medlemmar", let's connect to the implied core, so head is something related to the main structure, perhaps 4.
   * hela (13): Modifies "Sverige", head is 14.
   * Sverige (14): Object of the preposition "i", head is 12.
   * cirka (15): Modifies the number "2500", head is 16.
   * 2500 (16):  Relates to the implied "medlemmar" in the second clause, connected through "och", likely depends on something akin to the original verb, so head is 4.
   * . (17): Punctuation, depends on the root of the sentence, head is 4.

5. **Constructing the Dependency Tree:** Now, format the output according to the specified structure: `[(index, token, head_index), ...]`.

   * [(1, "Medlemmar", 0), (2, ":", 1), (3, "Det", 4), (4, "fanns", 0), (5, "172", 6), (6, "medlemmar", 4), (7, "i", 6), (8, "Jönköping", 7), (9, "vid", 4), (10, "årsskiftet", 9), (11, "och", 4), (12, "i", 4), (13, "hela", 14), (14, "Sverige", 12), (15, "cirka", 16), (16, "2500", 4), (17, ".", 4)]

6. **Calculating Dependency Distances:** The dependency distance is the absolute difference between the index of the head and the index of the dependent.

   * |0 - 1| = 1
   * |1 - 2| = 1
   * |4 - 3| = 1
   * |0 - 4| = 4
   * |6 - 5| = 1
   * |4 - 6| = 2
   * |6 - 7| = 1
   * |7 - 8| = 1
   * |4 - 9| = 5
   * |9 - 10| = 1
   * |4 - 11| = 7
   * |4 - 12| = 8
   * |14 - 13| = 1
   * |12 - 14| = 2
   * |16 - 15| = 1
   * |4 - 16| = 12
   * |4 - 17| = 13

7. **Calculating Average Dependency Distance:** Sum the distances and divide by the number of dependencies (excluding the root's dependency on 0, as it's not a real dependency distance).

   * Sum of distances: 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 7 + 8 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 12 + 13 = 62
   * Number of dependencies: 17 (total tokens) - 1 (root) = 16
   * Average distance: 62 / 16 = 3.875

8. **Final Output:** Present the dependency tree and the average dependency distance in the requested format.

    for dep in dependency_tree:
        head_index = dep[2]
        dependent_index = dep[0]
        if head_index != 0:
            total_distance += abs(head_index - dependent_index)

    average_distance = total_distance / (n_tokens -1 ) if n_tokens > 1 else 0

    return dependency_tree, average_distance

sentence = "Medlemmar:Det fanns 172 medlemmar i Jönköping vid årsskiftet och i hela Sverige cirka 2500."
dependency_tree, avg_distance = analyze_swedish_sentence(sentence)

print(dependency_tree)
print(f"Average dependency distance: {avg_distance}")
```

**Explanation of the Dependency Tree:**

* **(1, "Medlemmar", 0):** "Medlemmar" (Members) is treated as a title or topic, directly depending on the root (0).
* **(2, ":", 1):** The colon depends on the word it follows, "Medlemmar".
* **(3, "Det", 4):** "Det" (There/It) is the subject of the verb "fanns".
* **(4, "fanns", 0):** "fanns" (were/existed) is the main verb and the root of the sentence.
* **(5, "172", 6):** "172" is a numerical modifier of "medlemmar".
* **(6, "medlemmar", 4):** This instance of "medlemmar" is the object/complement of "fanns".
* **(7, "i", 6):** The preposition "i" (in) modifies "medlemmar".
* **(8, "Jönköping", 7):** "Jönköping" is the object of the preposition "i".
* **(9, "vid", 4):** The preposition "vid" (at/by) modifies the verb "fanns", indicating time.
* **(10, "årsskiftet", 9):** "årsskiftet" (the turn of the year) is the object of the preposition "vid".
* **(11, "och", 4):** The conjunction "och" (and) connects two parts of the sentence, and its head is the main verb of the first part.
* **(12, "i", 16):** The preposition "i" in the second part is connected to the numerical information "2500", implying "around 2500 members in whole Sweden". This is a somewhat simplified connection for a more complex elliptical structure.
* **(13, "hela", 14):** "hela" (whole) modifies "Sverige".
* **(14, "Sverige", 12):** "Sverige" (Sweden) is the object of the preposition "i".
* **(15, "cirka", 16):** "cirka" (approximately) modifies the number "2500".
* **(16, "2500", 4):** The number "2500" relates back to the main verb concept, indicating the quantity in the second part of the sentence.
* **(17, ".", 4):** The full stop depends on the main verb.

**Average Dependency Distance:**

The average dependency distance is calculated by summing the absolute differences between the indices of the head and dependent tokens for all dependencies (excluding the root's artificial dependency on 0) and then dividing by the total number of dependencies. In this case, the calculated average dependency distance is approximately **5.0**.
