Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence and create the dependency tree:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The request asks for a dependency tree representation of a Swedish sentence, along with the average dependency distance. The format of the dependency tree is clearly specified: `(token_index, token, head_index)`. Punctuation should be treated as tokens.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break down the sentence into individual tokens. The provided input already has the tokens numbered, which simplifies this step considerably. I just need to extract the tokens. It's important to preserve the order.

3. **Dependency Parsing (Conceptual):** This is the core of the task. I need to determine the grammatical relationships between the words. This involves identifying the head of each word (the word it depends on). I'll rely on my knowledge of Swedish grammar, specifically dependency grammar principles.

4. **Step-by-Step Dependency Analysis:**  I'll go through the sentence token by token and determine its head.

    * **"Sammanfattning" (Summary):**  This looks like the main topic or subject of the sentence. It doesn't seem to depend on any preceding word. It's likely the root of the sentence. So, its head is 0.

    * **"I" (In):** This is a preposition. Prepositions typically modify nouns or phrases. It introduces a time phrase. It's likely dependent on "dessa dagar".

    * **"dessa" (these):** This is a determiner modifying "dagar". So, "dagar" is its head.

    * **"dagar" (days):** This is a noun. The phrase "I dessa dagar" modifies the main verb. The main verb is "försöker". So, "försöker" is its head.

    * **"försöker" (try):** This is the main verb of the sentence. Its head is the root (0).

    * **"byggherrar" (developers):** This is a noun, acting as the subject of the verb "försöker". So, "försöker" is its head.

    * **"och" (and):** This is a conjunction connecting "byggherrar" and "byggentreprenörer". Conjunctions usually depend on the first element they conjoin. So, "byggherrar" is its head.

    * **"byggentreprenörer" (building contractors):** This is a noun, part of the conjoined subject. Its head is "byggherrar" (via the conjunction).

    * **"på" (in/on):** This is a preposition, introducing a phrase indicating *how* they try. It likely modifies "sätt".

    * **"många" (many):** This is a determiner modifying "sätt". So, "sätt" is its head.

    * **"sätt" (ways):** This is a noun. The prepositional phrase "på många sätt" likely modifies the verb "försöker". So, "försöker" is its head.

    * **"att" (to):** This is a particle introducing an infinitive clause. It depends on the verb "försöker".

    * **"skapa" (create):** This is the infinitive verb. It's the core of the infinitive clause. Its head is the particle "att".

    * **"lösningar" (solutions):** This is the object of the verb "skapa". So, "skapa" is its head.

    * **"för" (for):** This is a preposition introducing a phrase describing the purpose of the solutions. It likely modifies "boende".

    * **"ett" (a/an):** This is a determiner modifying "boende". So, "boende" is its head.

    * **"energieffektivt" (energy-efficient):** This is an adjective modifying "boende". So, "boende" is its head.

    * **"boende" (living/housing):** This is a noun. The prepositional phrase "för ett energieffektivt boende" modifies "lösningar". So, "lösningar" is its head.

    * **"." (period):** This is punctuation and depends on the root of the sentence, "Sammanfattning".

5. **Construct the Dependency Tree:** Now I can assemble the dependency triples based on the analysis above.

6. **Calculate Dependency Distances:**

    * For each triple `(token_index, token, head_index)`, the dependency distance is `abs(token_index - head_index)`.
    * Sum the distances for all tokens.
    * Divide the sum by the total number of tokens to get the average distance.

7. **Format the Output:** Present the dependency tree in the specified format and the calculated average dependency distance. Double-check the indices to ensure they are correct.

**Self-Correction/Refinement during the process:**

* Initially, I might have thought "Sammanfattning" depends on "försöker". However, re-reading the sentence, it feels more like an introductory statement or topic. Therefore, making it the root makes more sense grammatically.
* I might have hesitated about the attachment of the prepositional phrases. Thinking about what each phrase modifies helps. "I dessa dagar" tells *when* they try, modifying "försöker". "på många sätt" tells *how* they try, also modifying "försöker". "för ett energieffektivt boende" describes the *purpose* of the solutions, modifying "lösningar".
* Double-checking the conjunction: "och" connects elements of the same grammatical role. Here, it connects the two subjects.

By following these steps and constantly refining my analysis, I arrive at the correct dependency tree and average distance.
```
[(2, Sammanfattning, 0), (3, I, 4), (4, dessa, 5), (5, dagar, 6), (6, försöker, 2), (7, byggherrar, 6), (8, och, 7), (9, byggentreprenörer, 7), (10, på, 11), (11, många, 12), (12, sätt, 6), (13, att, 14), (14, skapa, 13), (15, lösningar, 14), (16, för, 19), (17, ett, 19), (18, energieffektivt, 19), (19, boende, 15), (20, ., 2)]
```

**Average Dependency Distance Calculation:**

1. **Calculate the dependency distance for each token:**
   - Sammanfattning: |2 - 0| = 2
   - I: |3 - 4| = 1
   - dessa: |4 - 5| = 1
   - dagar: |5 - 6| = 1
   - försöker: |6 - 2| = 4
   - byggherrar: |7 - 6| = 1
   - och: |8 - 7| = 1
   - byggentreprenörer: |9 - 7| = 2
   - på: |10 - 11| = 1
   - många: |11 - 12| = 1
   - sätt: |12 - 6| = 6
   - att: |13 - 14| = 1
   - skapa: |14 - 13| = 1
   - lösningar: |15 - 14| = 1
   - för: |16 - 19| = 3
   - ett: |17 - 19| = 2
   - energieffektivt: |18 - 19| = 1
   - boende: |19 - 15| = 4
   - .: |20 - 2| = 18

2. **Sum the dependency distances:**
   2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 18 = 52

3. **Divide the sum by the total number of tokens (19):**
   52 / 20 = 2.6

**Average Dependency Distance: 2.6**
