Here's a breakdown of the thought process to achieve the dependency parse and average dependency distance:

1. **Understanding the Request:** The core task is to produce a dependency tree and calculate the average dependency distance for a Swedish sentence. The specified output format for the dependency tree is crucial.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence down into individual tokens. This is relatively straightforward for this sentence. I need to be careful to treat punctuation marks as separate tokens.

   * Är
   * vätskan
   * varm
   * ,
   * späd
   * lite
   * i
   * sänder
   * under
   * omrörning
   * och
   * låt
   * redningen
   * koka
   * upp
   * mellan
   * varje
   * spädning
   * .

3. **Dependency Parsing (The Core Challenge):** This is the most complex part. I need to determine the head of each token. This involves understanding the grammatical relationships between the words. I'll approach this step-by-step, considering the role of each word:

   * **"Är" (Is):** This is likely the main verb of the first clause. Since it's at the beginning of a question-like structure (although not formally a question due to the lack of inversion later), it's probably the root of that part. The question mark is absent, but the intonation implies a question or condition.

   * **"vätskan" (the liquid):**  This is the subject of the verb "är".

   * **"varm" (warm):** This is a predicate adjective describing "vätskan".

   * **"," (comma):**  Punctuation marks typically attach to the head of the clause or phrase they separate. In this case, it separates the initial conditional clause. "Är" seems like a good candidate.

   * **"späd" (dilute/add):** This is the main verb of the second independent clause. It's coordinated with "låt" later. Since "Är" starts the sentence, and the clauses are linked, it's plausible "späd" depends on "är" in some way.

   * **"lite" (a little):** This modifies "späd", indicating the amount.

   * **"i" (in):** This is part of the prepositional phrase "i sänder".

   * **"sänder" (turns/goes):** This functions with "i" as a modifier of "späd". "i" is the head of this phrase.

   * **"under" (during/while):** This introduces a prepositional phrase.

   * **"omrörning" (stirring):** This is the noun in the prepositional phrase headed by "under".

   * **"och" (and):** This conjunction connects the two imperative clauses "späd..." and "låt...". It usually attaches to the head of the first conjoined clause, which is "späd".

   * **"låt" (let):** This is the main verb of the third imperative clause, coordinated with "späd".

   * **"redningen" (the thickening agent/the roux):** This is the object of "låt".

   * **"koka" (boil):** This is an infinitive verb that depends on "låt".

   * **"upp" (up):** This is a particle modifying the verb "koka".

   * **"mellan" (between):** This introduces a prepositional phrase.

   * **"varje" (each/every):** This modifies "spädning".

   * **"spädning" (dilution/addition):** This is the noun in the prepositional phrase headed by "mellan".

   * **"." (full stop):** This punctuation mark attaches to the main root of the sentence, which is likely "är".

4. **Constructing the Dependency Tree (Triples):** Now, I translate the identified dependencies into the required triple format (token index, token, head index).

   * (1, Är, 0) - Root of the first clause
   * (2, vätskan, 1) - Subject of "Är"
   * (3, varm, 1) - Predicate adjective of "Är"
   * (4, ,, 1) - Separates the conditional clause
   * (5, späd, 1) -  Main verb of the second clause, coordinated with the first.
   * (6, lite, 5) - Modifies "späd"
   * (7, i, 5) - Part of the adverbial phrase
   * (8, sänder, 7) -  Object of the preposition "i"
   * (9, under, 5) - Introduces an adverbial phrase
   * (10, omrörning, 9) - Object of the preposition "under"
   * (11, och, 5) - Connects the two imperative clauses.
   * (12, låt, 5) - Main verb of the third clause.
   * (13, redningen, 12) - Object of "låt"
   * (14, koka, 12) -  Infinitive verb depending on "låt"
   * (15, upp, 14) - Particle of "koka"
   * (16, mellan, 14) - Introduces an adverbial phrase modifying "koka upp"
   * (17, varje, 18) - Modifier of "spädning"
   * (18, spädning, 16) - Object of the preposition "mellan"
   * (19, ., 1) - Attaches to the root.

5. **Calculating Dependency Distances:**  For each triple, the dependency distance is the absolute difference between the head index and the token index.

   * |0 - 1| = 1
   * |1 - 2| = 1
   * |1 - 3| = 2
   * |1 - 4| = 3
   * |1 - 5| = 4
   * |5 - 6| = 1
   * |5 - 7| = 2
   * |7 - 8| = 1
   * |5 - 9| = 4
   * |9 - 10| = 1
   * |5 - 11| = 6
   * |5 - 12| = 7
   * |12 - 13| = 1
   * |12 - 14| = 2
   * |14 - 15| = 1
   * |14 - 16| = 2
   * |16 - 17| = 1
   * |16 - 18| = 2
   * |1 - 19| = 18

6. **Calculating Average Dependency Distance:** Sum the individual distances and divide by the total number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens minus the root, or the number of triples).

   Sum of distances = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 6 + 7 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 18 = 60
   Number of dependencies = 19

   Average distance = 60 / 19 ≈ 3.16

7. **Final Output:** Combine the dependency tree and the average distance into the required format. Double-check the indices and make sure they're correct.
```
[(1, Är, 0), (2, vätskan, 1), (3, varm, 1), (4, ,, 1), (5, späd, 1), (6, lite, 5), (7, i, 5), (8, sänder, 7), (9, under, 5), (10, omrörning, 9), (11, och, 5), (12, låt, 5), (13, redningen, 12), (14, koka, 12), (15, upp, 14), (16, mellan, 14), (17, varje, 18), (18, spädning, 16), (19, ., 1)]
```

**Average Dependency Distance Calculation:**

To calculate the average dependency distance, we need to find the absolute difference between the head index and the dependent index for each dependency and then compute the average.

1. **Dependency Distances:**
   - |0 - 1| = 1
   - |1 - 2| = 1
   - |1 - 3| = 2
   - |1 - 4| = 3
   - |1 - 5| = 4
   - |5 - 6| = 1
   - |5 - 7| = 2
   - |7 - 8| = 1
   - |5 - 9| = 4
   - |9 - 10| = 1
   - |5 - 11| = 6
   - |5 - 12| = 7
   - |12 - 13| = 1
   - |12 - 14| = 2
   - |14 - 15| = 1
   - |14 - 16| = 2
   - |16 - 17| = 1
   - |16 - 18| = 2
   - |1 - 19| = 18

2. **Sum of Distances:** 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 6 + 7 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 18 = 60

3. **Number of Dependencies:** There are 19 dependencies (one for each token except the root).

4. **Average Dependency Distance:** 60 / 19 = 3.1578947368421053

**Therefore, the average dependency distance is approximately 3.16.**
