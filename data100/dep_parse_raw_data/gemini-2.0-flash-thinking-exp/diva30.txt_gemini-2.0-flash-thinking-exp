Here's a breakdown of the thought process to generate the dependency tree and calculate the average dependency distance for the Swedish sentence:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The main task is to create a dependency tree representation of the provided Swedish sentence and calculate the average dependency distance. The output format is explicitly defined.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence into individual tokens. This seems straightforward, but care must be taken to handle punctuation correctly. Go through the sentence and identify each distinct word and punctuation mark.

    * *Initial Tokenization (Manual):* För, att, skapa, struktur, delas, projektet, in, i, fem, faser, :, Analys, av, Elmo, ,, planering, ,, konceptutveckling, ,, detaljkonstruktion, och, slutligen, produktutveckling, och, testning, .

3. **Dependency Parsing (The Core Challenge):** This is the most complex part. I need to determine the head of each token. This involves understanding the grammatical relationships between the words. I'll go through the sentence word by word and determine its dependency. I'll iterate multiple times, refining the connections.

    * *Pass 1 - Initial Guesses (Focus on main verbs and subjects):*
        * "delas" seems to be the main verb. "projektet" is being divided, so it depends on "delas".
        * "För att skapa struktur" seems like an adverbial clause modifying "delas". "skapa" depends on "att", and "struktur" depends on "skapa". "att" likely modifies "delas".
        * "in i fem faser" modifies "delas", indicating *how* it's divided. "i" is a preposition, so "faser" depends on "i". "fem" modifies "faser".
        * The list after the colon modifies "faser" and provides examples. The comma likely connects the items.
        * "Analys av Elmo": "Analys" is the noun, "av" is a preposition, "Elmo" is the object of the preposition.
        * Similar logic for the other items in the list.
        * "slutligen" modifies "delas" or possibly the preceding item. It seems like an adverbial modifier.
        * "produktutveckling och testning":  "och" connects the two nouns.

    * *Pass 2 - Refining Relationships (Focus on prepositions, conjunctions, and modifiers):*
        * Double-check the "för att" construction. "att" is usually subordinate to the verb "skapa". "för" modifies "att".
        * Confirm that "in" is the head of "faser".
        * The colon likely depends on "faser", introducing the list.
        * The commas act as coordinators, connecting the list items. They likely depend on the last preceding item *before* another coordinating conjunction.
        * "av" connects "Analys" and "Elmo".
        * The second "och" connects "produktutveckling" and "testning".
        * "slutligen" seems to modify "delas", indicating the timing.

    * *Pass 3 - Finalizing and Numbering (Assigning indices and confirming heads):*  Now that the basic dependencies are established, assign indices to each token and represent the connections numerically. Pay close attention to the index numbers.

        * (1, För, 4)  ("För" modifies "att")
        * (2, att, 5)  ("att" introduces the infinitive clause and modifies "delas")
        * (3, skapa, 2) ("skapa" is the verb in the infinitive clause, depends on "att")
        * (4, struktur, 3) ("struktur" is the object of "skapa")
        * (5, delas, 0) ("delas" is the main verb)
        * (6, projektet, 5) ("projektet" is the subject of "delas")
        * (7, in, 5) ("in" is a particle modifying "delas")
        * (8, i, 7) ("i" is a preposition modifying "in")
        * (9, fem, 10) ("fem" modifies "faser")
        * (10, faser, 8) ("faser" is the object of the preposition "i")
        * (11, :, 10) (The colon explains "faser")
        * (12, Analys, 11) ("Analys" is the first item in the list)
        * (13, av, 12) ("av" connects "Analys" and "Elmo")
        * (14, Elmo, 13) ("Elmo" is the object of the preposition "av")
        * (15, ,, 12) (The comma coordinates with "Analys")
        * (16, planering, 12) ("planering" is another item in the list coordinated with "Analys")
        * (17, ,, 16) (The comma coordinates with "planering")
        * (18, konceptutveckling, 12) ("konceptutveckling" is another item in the list)
        * (19, ,, 18) (The comma coordinates with "konceptutveckling")
        * (20, detaljkonstruktion, 12) ("detaljkonstruktion" is another item in the list)
        * (21, och, 20) ("och" connects "detaljkonstruktion" and the subsequent phrase)
        * (22, slutligen, 5) ("slutligen" modifies the main verb "delas")
        * (23, produktutveckling, 21) ("produktutveckling" is coordinated with "detaljkonstruktion")
        * (24, och, 23) ("och" connects "produktutveckling" and "testning")
        * (25, testning, 23) ("testning" is coordinated with "produktutveckling")
        * (26, ., 5) (The period ends the sentence and depends on the main verb)

4. **Calculate Average Dependency Distance:**

    * Iterate through the dependency tree tuples.
    * For each tuple `(child_index, child_token, head_index)`, calculate the absolute difference between `child_index` and `head_index`: `abs(child_index - head_index)`.
    * Sum these distances.
    * Divide the sum by the total number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens minus 1, as the root has no head).

    * *Calculation:*
        * |1-4| + |2-5| + |3-2| + |4-3| + |6-5| + |7-5| + |8-7| + |9-10| + |10-8| + |11-10| + |12-11| + |13-12| + |14-13| + |15-12| + |16-12| + |17-16| + |18-12| + |19-18| + |20-12| + |21-20| + |22-5| + |23-21| + |24-23| + |25-23| + |26-5|
        * 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 8 + 1 + 17 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 21 = 84
        * Number of dependencies = 26 - 1 = 25
        * Average distance = 84 / 25 = 3.36

5. **Format the Output:**  Ensure the output matches the specified format. Present the dependency tree as a list of tuples and the average dependency distance as a single number.
```
[(1, För, 2), (2, att, 5), (3, skapa, 2), (4, struktur, 3), (5, delas, 0), (6, projektet, 5), (7, in, 5), (8, i, 7), (9, fem, 10), (10, faser, 8), (11, :, 10), (12, Analys, 11), (13, av, 12), (14, Elmo, 13), (15, ,, 12), (16, planering, 12), (17, ,, 16), (18, konceptutveckling, 12), (19, ,, 18), (20, detaljkonstruktion, 12), (21, och, 20), (22, slutligen, 5), (23, produktutveckling, 21), (24, och, 23), (25, testning, 23), (26, ., 5)]
```

**Average Dependency Distance Calculation:**

To calculate the average dependency distance, we sum the absolute differences between the head and dependent indices and then divide by the total number of dependencies (which is the number of tokens minus 1, as the root has no head).

1. |1 - 2| = 1
2. |2 - 5| = 3
3. |3 - 2| = 1
4. |4 - 3| = 1
5. |6 - 5| = 1
6. |7 - 5| = 2
7. |8 - 7| = 1
8. |9 - 10| = 1
9. |10 - 8| = 2
10. |11 - 10| = 1
11. |12 - 11| = 1
12. |13 - 12| = 1
13. |14 - 13| = 1
14. |15 - 12| = 3
15. |16 - 12| = 4
16. |17 - 16| = 1
17. |18 - 12| = 6
18. |19 - 18| = 1
19. |20 - 12| = 8
20. |21 - 20| = 1
21. |22 - 5| = 17
22. |23 - 21| = 2
23. |24 - 23| = 1
24. |25 - 23| = 2
25. |26 - 5| = 21

Sum of distances = 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 6 + 1 + 8 + 1 + 17 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 21 = 84

Number of dependencies = 26 - 1 = 25

Average dependency distance = 84 / 25 = **3.36**
