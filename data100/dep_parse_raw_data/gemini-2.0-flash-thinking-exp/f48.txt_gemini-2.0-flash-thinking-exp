Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence and generate the dependency tree:

1. **Understanding the Request:** The core task is dependency parsing for Swedish and calculating the average dependency distance. The output format is clearly specified: `[(token_index, token, head_index), ...]`. Punctuation is included as a token.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break the sentence into individual tokens. This involves identifying words and punctuation marks.

   * "Då"
   * "ändrade"
   * "ordet"
   * "hacker"
   * "mening"
   * "till"
   * "att"
   * "betyda"
   * "ungefär"
   * '"'
   * "En"
   * "person"
   * "som"
   * "arbetar"
   * ","
   * "sover"
   * "och"
   * "lever"
   * "med"
   * "datorer"
   * '"'
   * "."

3. **Dependency Analysis (Manual):**  This is the most crucial and complex step. It requires understanding the grammatical relationships between the words. I'll go through the sentence word by word and determine the head of each word.

   * **Då:**  This is an adverbial modifier indicating time. It modifies the verb "ändrade."  Head: "ändrade" (2)
   * **ändrade:** This is the main verb of the clause. Head: Root (0)
   * **ordet:** This is the subject of the verb "ändrade." Head: "ändrade" (2)
   * **hacker:** This is a noun modifying "ordet" (specifying which word). Head: "ordet" (3)
   * **mening:** This is the direct object of the verb "ändrade." Head: "ändrade" (2)
   * **till:** This is a preposition introducing a prepositional phrase. Head: "ändrade" (2) (Prepositions are often attached to the verb they modify).
   * **att:** This is a subordinator introducing an infinitive clause. Head: "till" (6) (Subordinators often attach to the preceding preposition).
   * **betyda:** This is the infinitive verb. Head: "att" (7). *Initial thought: Could it attach to "till"?  No, "att" is the clearer introducer of the infinitive.*
   * **ungefär:** This is an adverb modifying "betyda." Head: "betyda" (8)
   * **":** This is a punctuation mark. It separates the main clause from the explanation. Head: "betyda" (8) (It elaborates on what "betyda" means).
   * **En:** This is a determiner modifying "person." Head: "person" (12)
   * **person:** This is the noun being defined. Head: "betyda" (8) (The entire phrase "En person..." explains the meaning of "betyda"). *Correction: On second thought, "person" is the head of the following clause, so the colon is the connector here. The entire definition modifies "betyda." Let's connect the beginning of the definition to the colon.* Head: ":" (10). *Further refinement: The colon modifies "betyda," and the definition elaborates on the colon. So, the colon should be the head of the definition. The phrase "En person..." functions as an apposition to the meaning of the word.*
   * **som:** This is a relative pronoun introducing a relative clause. Head: "person" (12)
   * **arbetar:** This is the verb in the relative clause. Head: "som" (13)
   * **,:** This is punctuation, separating items in a list. Head: "arbetar" (14) (Connects to the first verb in the list)
   * **sover:** This is another verb in the relative clause. Head: "arbetar" (14) (Conjunction implies a coordinate structure, but in dependency parsing, one typically heads the other).
   * **och:** This is a conjunction joining "sover" and "lever." Head: "sover" (16)
   * **lever:** This is the final verb in the relative clause. Head: "sover" (16)
   * **med:** This is a preposition introducing a prepositional phrase. Head: "lever" (18)
   * **datorer:** This is the object of the preposition "med." Head: "med" (19)
   * **":** This is the closing quotation mark. Head: "betyda" (8) (Matches the opening quote).
   * **.:** This is the sentence-ending punctuation. Head: "ändrade" (2) (Often attached to the main verb).

4. **Creating the Dependency Tree Representation:** Now, I'll translate the analysis into the required output format: `(token_index, token, head_index)`.

   * (1, Då, 2)
   * (2, ändrade, 0)
   * (3, ordet, 2)
   * (4, hacker, 3)
   * (5, mening, 2)
   * (6, till, 2)
   * (7, att, 6)
   * (8, betyda, 7)
   * (9, ungefär, 8)
   * (10, ", 8)
   * (11, En, 12)
   * (12, person, 10)
   * (13, som, 12)
   * (14, arbetar, 13)
   * (15, ,, 14)
   * (16, sover, 14)
   * (17, och, 16)
   * (18, lever, 16)
   * (19, med, 18)
   * (20, datorer, 19)
   * (21, ", 8)
   * (22, ., 2)

5. **Calculating Average Dependency Distance:**

   * Calculate the distance for each dependency: `abs(head_index - token_index)`
   * (1, Då, 2): |2 - 1| = 1
   * (2, ändrade, 0): |0 - 2| = 2
   * (3, ordet, 2): |2 - 3| = 1
   * (4, hacker, 3): |3 - 4| = 1
   * (5, mening, 2): |2 - 5| = 3
   * (6, till, 2): |2 - 6| = 4
   * (7, att, 6): |6 - 7| = 1
   * (8, betyda, 7): |7 - 8| = 1
   * (9, ungefär, 8): |8 - 9| = 1
   * (10, ", 8): |8 - 10| = 2
   * (11, En, 12): |12 - 11| = 1
   * (12, person, 10): |10 - 12| = 2
   * (13, som, 12): |12 - 13| = 1
   * (14, arbetar, 13): |13 - 14| = 1
   * (15, ,, 14): |14 - 15| = 1
   * (16, sover, 14): |14 - 16| = 2
   * (17, och, 16): |16 - 17| = 1
   * (18, lever, 16): |16 - 18| = 2
   * (19, med, 18): |18 - 19| = 1
   * (20, datorer, 19): |19 - 20| = 1
   * (21, ", 8): |8 - 21| = 13
   * (22, ., 2): |2 - 22| = 20

   * Sum of distances: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 13 + 20 = 61
   * Number of dependencies (excluding root): 22
   * Average distance: 61 / 22 ≈ 2.77

6. **Final Check:** Review the dependency tree and the average distance calculation for any errors. Ensure the tokenization and indexing are correct.
```
[(1, Då, 2), (2, ändrade, 0), (3, ordet, 2), (4, hacker, 3), (5, mening, 2), (6, till, 2), (7, att, 6), (8, betyda, 7), (9, ungefär, 8), (10, '"', 8), (11, En, 12), (12, person, 10), (13, som, 12), (14, arbetar, 13), (15, ,, 14), (16, sover, 14), (17, och, 16), (18, lever, 16), (19, med, 18), (20, datorer, 19), (21, '"', 8), (22, ., 2)]
```

**Explanation of the Dependency Tree:**

* **(1, Då, 2):** "Då" (Then) is an adverbial modifier of the verb "ändrade".
* **(2, ändrade, 0):** "ändrade" (changed) is the root of the sentence.
* **(3, ordet, 2):** "ordet" (the word) is the subject of the verb "ändrade".
* **(4, hacker, 3):** "hacker" is a noun modifying "ordet".
* **(5, mening, 2):** "mening" (meaning) is the direct object of the verb "ändrade".
* **(6, till, 2):** "till" (to) is a preposition introducing a prepositional phrase.
* **(7, att, 6):** "att" (to) is a subordinator connecting the prepositional phrase to the infinitive verb.
* **(8, betyda, 7):** "betyda" (to mean) is the infinitive verb, the head of which is "att".
* **(9, ungefär, 8):** "ungefär" (approximately) is an adverb modifying the verb "betyda".
* **(10, '"', 8):** The opening quotation mark modifies "betyda", indicating the start of a quote.
* **(11, En, 12):** "En" (A/An) is a determiner modifying the noun "person".
* **(12, person, 10):** "person" (person) is the noun within the quoted phrase, depending on the quotation mark.
* **(13, som, 12):** "som" (who/that) is a relative pronoun referring to "person".
* **(14, arbetar, 13):** "arbetar" (works) is the verb in the relative clause, with "som" as its head.
* **(15, ,, 14):** The comma separates the verbs in the list and depends on the first verb.
* **(16, sover, 14):** "sover" (sleeps) is another verb in the relative clause, coordinated with "arbetar".
* **(17, och, 16):** "och" (and) is a conjunction coordinating "sover" and "lever".
* **(18, lever, 16):** "lever" (lives) is the final verb in the coordinated list.
* **(19, med, 18):** "med" (with) is a preposition introducing a prepositional phrase.

* **(21, '"', 8):** The closing quotation mark modifies "betyda", indicating the end of the quote.
* **(22, ., 2):** The full stop marks the end of the sentence and depends on the root verb.

**Calculating Average Dependency Distance:**

To calculate the average dependency distance, we sum the absolute differences between the head and dependent token indices and then divide by the number of dependencies (excluding the root).

| Dependent Token | Head Token | Dependency Distance |
|---|---|---|
| Då (1) | ändrade (2) | |2 - 1| = 1 |
| ordet (3) | ändrade (2) | |2 - 3| = 1 |
| hacker (4) | ordet (3) | |3 - 4| = 1 |
| mening (5) | ändrade (2) | |2 - 5| = 3 |
| till (6) | ändrade (2) | |2 - 6| = 4 |
| att (7) | till (6) | |6 - 7| = 1 |
| betyda (8) | att (7) | |7 - 8| = 1 |
| ungefär (9) | betyda (8) | |8 - 9| = 1 |
| " (10) | betyda (8) | |8 - 10| = 2 |
| En (11) | person (12) | |12 - 11| = 1 |
| person (12) | " (10) | |10 - 12| = 2 |
| som (13) | person (12) | |12 - 13| = 1 |
| arbetar (14) | som (13) | |13 - 14| = 1 |
| , (15) | arbetar (14) | |14 - 15| = 1 |
| sover (16) | arbetar (14) | |14 - 16| = 2 |
| och (17) | sover (16) | |16 - 17| = 1 |
| lever (18) | sover (16) | |16 - 18| = 2 |
| med (19) | lever (18) | |18 - 19| = 1 |
| datorer (20) | med (19) | |19 - 20| = 1 |
| " (21) | betyda (8) | |8 - 21| = 13 |
| . (22) | ändrade (2) | |2 - 22| = 20 |

Sum of dependency distances = 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 13 + 20 = 61
Number of dependencies = 21

Average dependency distance = 61 / 21 ≈ **2.90**
