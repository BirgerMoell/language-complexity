Here's a breakdown of the thought process to analyze the Swedish sentence and generate the dependency tree:

1. **Understand the Goal:** The primary goal is to create a dependency tree representation of the Swedish sentence and calculate the average dependency distance. The output format is clearly defined.

2. **Tokenization:** The first step is to break down the sentence into individual tokens. This is usually straightforward, separating words by spaces. Punctuation marks also need to be treated as separate tokens. Carefully go through the sentence:

   * Plebejer
   * var
   * ”
   * vanliga
   * ”
   * människor
   * som
   * hade
   * simpla
   * yrken
   * som
   * hantverkare
   * eller
   * arbetare
   * tyckte
   * Isabells
   * föräldrar
   * .

3. **Identify the Root:**  In a dependency tree, there's a single root node. The root is usually the main verb of the sentence. In this case, the main verb seems to be "tyckte" (thought). This will be the head of the entire structure, represented with a head index of 0.

4. **Establish Dependencies - Word by Word:** Now, go through each token and determine its head – the word it depends on. This requires understanding the grammatical relationships between words.

   * **Plebejer:** What did they *do*? They *were*. So, "var" is the head. `(1, Plebejer, 2)`
   * **var:** This is the main verb (likely the root, but we'll confirm later).
   * **”:** This quotation mark belongs to "vanliga". `(3, ”, 4)`
   * **vanliga:** This describes "människor". `(4, vanliga, 6)`
   * **”:** This quotation mark also belongs to "vanliga". `(5, ”, 4)`
   * **människor:** This is the subject of "var". `(6, människor, 2)`
   * **som:** This introduces a relative clause modifying "yrken". `(7, som, 10)`
   * **hade:** This is the verb within the relative clause, and its subject is implicitly "människor" (or perhaps more specifically "yrken"). Let's link it to "yrken" for now. `(8, hade, 10)`
   * **simpla:** This describes "yrken". `(9, simpla, 10)`
   * **yrken:** This is what was being had. It's linked to "hade". `(10, yrken, 2)`  *Correction: I initially linked "hade" to "yrken", but "yrken" is the object of "hade". So, "yrken" depends on "hade".* `(10, yrken, 8)`
   * **som:** This acts as a conjunction introducing examples. It seems to be connected to "yrken". `(11, som, 10)`
   * **hantverkare:** This is an example of "yrken". `(12, hantverkare, 10)`
   * **eller:** This connects "hantverkare" and "arbetare". The head is usually the first element in the conjunction. `(13, eller, 12)`
   * **arbetare:**  The other part of the conjunction. `(14, arbetare, 12)`
   * **tyckte:**  This is the main verb of the sentence, indicating the opinion. It's the root. `(15, tyckte, 0)`
   * **Isabells:** This is a possessive modifying "föräldrar". `(16, Isabells, 17)`
   * **föräldrar:** This is the subject of "tyckte". `(17, föräldrar, 15)`
   * **.:** This punctuates the sentence and is linked to the root verb. `(18, ., 15)`

5. **Review and Refine:**  Go back through the dependencies and check for consistency and correctness. Are the relationships logical?  Does the tree make sense grammatically?

   * Initially, I had "yrken" linked to "var". However, the phrase "som hade simpla yrken" acts as a description of "människor". Therefore, "yrken" should be linked within that relative clause.
   * Double-check the conjunction "eller". It connects "hantverkare" and "arbetare", and "hantverkare" is likely the head of the coordinated phrase.

6. **Construct the Dependency Tree Output:** Format the results according to the specified output: `(index, token, head_index)`.

7. **Calculate Dependency Distances:** For each token (except the root), calculate the absolute difference between its index and the index of its head.

   * Plebejer: |1 - 2| = 1
   * var:  |2 - 0| = 2
   * ”: |3 - 4| = 1
   * vanliga: |4 - 6| = 2
   * ”: |5 - 4| = 1
   * människor: |6 - 2| = 4
   * som: |7 - 10| = 3
   * hade: |8 - 10| = 2
   * simpla: |9 - 10| = 1
   * yrken: |10 - 2| = 8
   * som: |11 - 10| = 1
   * hantverkare: |12 - 10| = 2
   * eller: |13 - 12| = 1
   * arbetare: |14 - 12| = 2
   * tyckte: |15 - 0| = 15
   * Isabells: |16 - 17| = 1
   * föräldrar: |17 - 15| = 2
   * .: |18 - 15| = 3

8. **Calculate Average Dependency Distance:** Sum the dependency distances and divide by the number of tokens (excluding the root, which has no incoming dependency).

   * Sum: 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 15 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 51
   * Number of tokens (excluding root): 18
   * Average: 51 / 18 = 2.8333...

9. **Final Output:** Present the dependency tree and the calculated average dependency distance in the requested format.
```python
import nltk

sentence = "Plebejer var ”vanliga” människor som hade simpla yrken som hantverkare eller arbetare tyckte Isabells föräldrar."
tokens = nltk.word_tokenize(sentence)

# Manually assigning dependencies based on grammatical analysis.
# This is a simplified approach and might not be perfect. More sophisticated methods involve NLP libraries.
dependencies = [
    (1, 'Plebejer', 2),
    (2, 'var', 15),
    (3, '”', 4),
    (4, 'vanliga', 6),
    (5, '”', 4),
    (6, 'människor', 2),
    (7, 'som', 10),
    (8, 'hade', 10),
    (9, 'simpla', 10),
    (10, 'yrken', 6),
    (11, 'som', 12),
    (12, 'hantverkare', 10),
    (13, 'eller', 12),
    (14, 'arbetare', 12),
    (15, 'tyckte', 0),
    (16, 'Isabells', 17),
    (17, 'föräldrar', 15),
    (18, '.', 15),
]

print(dependencies)

# Calculate average dependency distance
total_distance = 0
for head_index, _, dependent_index in dependencies:
    if dependent_index != 0:
        total_distance += abs(head_index - dependent_index)

average_distance = total_distance / len(dependencies)

print(f"\nAverage Dependency Distance: {average_distance}")
```

**Explanation of the Dependency Tree:**

* **(1, 'Plebejer', 2):** The noun "Plebejer" is the subject of the verb "var".
* **(2, 'var', 15):** The verb "var" (were) is the main verb of the first clause and depends on the main verb "tyckte" (thought).
* **(3, '”', 4):** The opening quotation mark modifies the adjective "vanliga".
* **(4, 'vanliga', 6):** The adjective "vanliga" (ordinary) modifies the noun "människor".
* **(5, '”', 4):** The closing quotation mark modifies the adjective "vanliga".
* **(6, 'människor', 2):** The noun "människor" (people) is the subject of the verb "var".
* **(7, 'som', 10):** The relative pronoun "som" (who/that) introduces a relative clause modifying "yrken".
* **(8, 'hade', 10):** The verb "hade" (had) is the main verb within the relative clause and depends on "yrken".
* **(9, 'simpla', 10):** The adjective "simpla" (simple) modifies the noun "yrken".
* **(10, 'yrken', 6):** The noun "yrken" (professions) is the object of the verb "var" in the sense of being described as having these professions.
* **(11, 'som', 12):** The conjunction "som" introduces an example and depends on "hantverkare".
* **(12, 'hantverkare', 10):** The noun "hantverkare" (craftsmen) is an example of "yrken".
* **(13, 'eller', 12):** The conjunction "eller" (or) connects "hantverkare" and "arbetare", with "hantverkare" as the head.
* **(14, 'arbetare', 12):** The noun "arbetare" (workers) is coordinated with "hantverkare".
* **(15, 'tyckte', 0):** The verb "tyckte" (thought) is the root of the sentence.
* **(16, 'Isabells', 17):** The possessive noun "Isabells" modifies "föräldrar".
* **(17, 'föräldrar', 15):** The noun "föräldrar" (parents) is the subject of the verb "tyckte".
* **(18, '.', 15):** The full stop depends on the main verb "tyckte".

**Average Dependency Distance:**

The average dependency distance is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between the index of each token and its head, divided by the total number of tokens (excluding the root which has a head of 0 and doesn't contribute to the incoming dependency distance). In this case, the average dependency distance is approximately **2.83**.
