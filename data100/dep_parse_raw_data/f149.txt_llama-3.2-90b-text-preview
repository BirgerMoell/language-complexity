- "Mellan" (1), "åren" (2), "och 1885-1889" (a complex prepositional phrase with "och" as the conjunction) are adverbial modifiers of "har" (6).
- "störst" (7) is the main adjective describing "Götaland" (9), with "i Götaland" being an adverbial phrase modifying "störst".
- "och minst i Norrland" is the second conjunct in a coordination with "och" (11) as the conjunction, and "har" (6) as the governor, describing a contrast with the first part.
