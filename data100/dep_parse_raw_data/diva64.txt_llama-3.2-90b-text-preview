Based on the Swedish sentence, I will create a dependency tree using the Universal Dependencies framework. Here's the output:

[(1, För, 3),
(2, att, 3),
(3, kunna, 6),
(4, ställa, 6),
(5, upp, 4),
(6, en, 8),
(7, modell, 8),
(8, för, 10),
(9, spelets, 11),
(10, påverkan, 11),  # corrected word from påverkan to from påverkan -> påverkan was i and the sentence word is påverkan
(11, i, 13),
(12, pedalen, 13),
(13, studerades, 0),
(14, ett, 15),
(15, bromssystem, 13),
(16, från, 18),
(17, en, 18),
(18, Saab, 19),
(19, 9-3, 15)]

This output indicates that:

- The subordinating conjunction 'För att' (For that) is dependent on the verb 'kunna' (can).
- The verb 'ställa' (set) is a dependent of 'kunna'.
- The preposition 'upp' (up) is a dependent of 'ställa'.
- The determiner 'en' (a) is a dependent of 'modell' (model).
- The preposition 'för' (for) is a dependent of the main verb 'studerades' (was studied).
- The possessive pronoun 'spelets' (of the game) is a dependent of the noun 'påverkan' (influence) doesn't seem right 'spelets' doesn't have any dependency on other than 'påverkan'  i also studied that  påverkan was actually påverkan was i and shouldn't have any word dependency in parent so 9, and 10 has been linked with 11, taking the head dependency.
- The preposition 'i' is a dependent of the noun 'pedalen' (pedal).
- The main verb 'studerades' (was studied) is the head of the sentence.
- The determiner 'ett' is a dependent of the noun 'bromssystem' (brake system).
- The preposition 'från' (from) is a dependent of 'Saab'.
- The determiner 'en' (a) is a dependent of 'Saab'.
- The proper noun '9-3' is a dependent of 'Saab'.
