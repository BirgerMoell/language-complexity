To analyze the given Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we need to identify the tokens and their syntactic relationships. Here is the output in the specified format:

```
[(1, Ju, 2), (2, mer, 6), (3, man, 6), (4, möter, 2), (5, människor, 4), (6, med, 7), (7, annan, 8), (8, bakgrund, 6), 
 (9, ju, 10), (10, mer, 11), (11, förstår, 3), (12, man, 11), (13, att, 11), (14, det, 15), (15, ligger, 13), 
 (16, mycket, 17), (17, lite, 15), (18, i, 19), (19, alla, 20), (20, de, 21), (21, fördomar, 24), (22, som, 21), 
 (23, finns, 21), (24, utspridda, 21), (25, i, 26), (26, samhället, 25), (27, ., 0)]
```

Explanation:
- Each tuple `(index, token, head_index)` represents the token along with its dependency relation to the head token.
- The head index denotes which token this token is dependent on, with `0` indicating the root of the sentence. 
- Punctuation such as the period is treated as a token which is dependent on the root.
