To analyze the given Swedish sentence "Mellan åren 1885 och 1889 har störst i Götaland, och minst i Norrland." and produce a dependency tree, we proceed as follows:

1. Tokenize the sentence.
2. Identify the head for each token based on their grammatical relationships.
3. Create the dependency tree.

Here is the resulting output in the specified format:

```
[(1, Mellan, 2), 
 (2, åren, 5), 
 (3, 1885, 2), 
 (4, och, 2), 
 (5, 1889, 2), 
 (6, har, 0), 
 (7, störst, 6), 
 (8, i, 7), 
 (9, Götaland, 8), 
 (10, ,, 6), 
 (11, och, 6), 
 (12, minst, 11), 
 (13, i, 12), 
 (14, Norrland, 13), 
 (15, ., 6)]
```

In this representation:
- Each tuple consists of an index, the token, and the index of its head.
- The root of the sentence is indicated by a head index of 0.
