```

**Average Dependency Distance:** 2.75

**Explanation:**

- Each tuple is in the format `(token_index, token, head_index)`.
- Punctuation marks are included as separate tokens.
- The average dependency distance is calculated by taking the absolute difference between each token's index and its head's index, summing these differences, and then dividing by the total number of tokens. In this case, the total sum of differences is 66, and there are 24 tokens, resulting in an average distance of 2.75.
