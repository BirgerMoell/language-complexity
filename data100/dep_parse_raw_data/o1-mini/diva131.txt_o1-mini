Here is the dependency analysis for the provided sentence:

**Sentence:**
> Furthermore, a work sampling was carried out and the content of work in the workstations which were earlier identified as bottlenecks were observed.

**Tokenization and Dependency Tree:**

The sentence is tokenized into 25 tokens, including punctuation marks. Each token is represented as a tuple in the format `(index, token, head index)`.

```
[
  (1, Furthermore, 7),
  (2, ,, 1),
  (3, a, 5),
  (4, work, 5),
  (5, sampling, 7),
  (6, was, 7),
  (7, carried, 0),
  (8, out, 7),
  (9, and, 7),
  (10, the, 11),
  (11, content, 24),
  (12, of, 11),
  (13, work, 12),
  (14, in, 11),
  (15, the, 16),
  (16, workstations, 14),
  (17, which, 16),
  (18, were, 20),
  (19, earlier, 20),
  (20, identified, 17),
  (21, as, 20),
  (22, bottlenecks, 21),
  (23, were, 24),
  (24, observed, 9),
  (25, ., 7)
]
```

**Dependency Tree Explanation:**

- **Root of the Sentence:** The main verb "carried" (index 7) serves as the root of the dependency tree.
- **Conjunction:** The conjunction "and" (index 9) connects the two main verbs "carried" and "observed". The verb "observed" (index 24) is attached to "and".
- **Relative Clause:** The word "which" (index 17) introduces a relative clause modifying "workstations" (index 16). The verbs "were" (index 18) and "identified" (index 20) are part of this relative clause.
- **Modifiers and Determiners:** Articles like "a" (index 3) and "the" (indices 10, 15) are determiners modifying nouns. Adverbs like "Furthermore" (index 1) and "earlier" (index 19) modify verbs.

**Average Dependency Distance Calculation:**

The dependency distance for each token is calculated as the absolute difference between the token's index and its head's index. The average dependency distance is the mean of these values.

| Token Index | Token         | Head Index | Distance |
|-------------|---------------|------------|----------|
| 1           | Furthermore   | 7          | 6        |
