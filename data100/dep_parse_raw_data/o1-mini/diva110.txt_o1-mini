**Average Dependency Distance:** **3.13**

*Calculation Details:*

To compute the average dependency distance:

1. **Calculate the absolute difference** between each token's index and its head's index.
2. **Sum all the differences:** 97
3. **Divide by the total number of tokens:** 31

\[ \text{Average Dependency Distance} = \frac{97}{31} \approx 3.13 \]
