### Average Dependency Distance
The average dependency distance for the sentence is **3.05**.

### Explanation
- **Tokenization:** The sentence was tokenized into 22 tokens, including punctuation marks such as commas, quotes, and the period at the end.
  
- **Dependency Relations:** Each token is assigned a head based on its syntactic role in the sentence. For example, the main verb "채ndrade" is the root of the sentence with a head index of 0. Modifiers and dependents are linked accordingly, ensuring that punctuation marks are also appropriately connected.

- **Average Dependency Distance Calculation:** For each token, the absolute difference between its position and its head's position was calculated. The sum of these distances is 67, and dividing by the number of tokens (22) results in an average dependency distance of approximately 3.05.
