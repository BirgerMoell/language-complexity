```

**Average Dependency Distance:**
```
3.56
```

**Explanation:**

- **Dependency Tree Construction:**
  - Each token is assigned a head based on its syntactic role in the sentence.
  - For example, "Det" (1) is the subject of "kännas" (3), so its head is 3.
  - Punctuation marks like commas (13) and periods (34) are attached to the main verb "kännas" (3).

- **Calculating Average Dependency Distance:**
  - The dependency distance for each token is the absolute difference between its index and the index of its head.
  - Summing all distances: 121
  - Number of tokens: 34
  - Average Dependency Distance = 121 / 34 ≈ **3.56**
