```

### Average Dependency Distance
To calculate the average dependency distance, we compute the absolute difference between each token's index and its head's index, then take the mean of these values.

\[
\text{Average Dependency Distance} = \frac{94}{29} \approx 3.24
\]

**Average Dependency Distance:**Â 3.24
