### Average Dependency Distance

To compute the average dependency distance, we calculate the absolute difference between each token's index and its head's index, sum these differences, and then divide by the total number of tokens.

\[
\text{Average Dependency Distance} = \frac{61}{24} \approx 2.54
\]

**Average Dependency Distance: 2.54**
