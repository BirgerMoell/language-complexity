**Average Dependency Distance:** 2.0

---

**Explanation:**

- **Dependency Tree:** Each tuple represents a token in the sentence with its position index, the token itself, and the index of its head (governor) token. Punctuation marks are included as separate tokens and are connected to appropriate head tokens.
  
- **Average Dependency Distance:** This is calculated by taking the average of the absolute differences between each token's position and its head's position. For this sentence, the total sum of these distances is 70, and there are 35 tokens. Hence, the average dependency distance is \( \frac{70}{35} = 2.0 \).
