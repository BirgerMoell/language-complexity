**Average Dependency Distance:** 2.91

**Explanation of Dependency Assignments:**

1. **Main Verb (`sätta`, token 16):** Connected to the root (0).
2. **Auxiliary Verb (`ska`, token 13):** Connected to `sätta` (16).
3. **Subjects (`man`, tokens 3 & 14):** Connected to their respective verbs (`misstänker` (4) and `sätta` (16)).
4. **Subordinate Clauses:** Words like `misstänker` (4) and `smittad` (8) are connected appropriately to reflect the sentence's hierarchical structure.
5. **Conjunctions and Punctuations:** Punctuation marks and conjunctions like `och` are connected to relevant nouns or verbs they coordinate.
6. **Modifiers:** Adverbs and determiners are connected to the words they modify, ensuring the grammatical relationships are accurately represented.

**Calculation of Average Dependency Distance:**

The dependency distance for each token is calculated as the absolute difference between the token's index and its head's index. Summing these distances and dividing by the total number of tokens (32) gives the average dependency distance.

```
Total Dependency Distance = 93
Number of Tokens = 32
Average Dependency Distance = 93 / 32 ≈ 2.91
