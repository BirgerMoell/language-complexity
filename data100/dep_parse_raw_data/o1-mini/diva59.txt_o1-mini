### Average Dependency Distance
To calculate the average dependency distance:

1. **Compute the absolute difference** between each token's index and its head's index.
2. **Sum all the differences**.
3. **Divide by the total number of tokens**.

Calculations:
```
Total dependency distance = 1 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 
                             1 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 11 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 
                             1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 23 = 95

Number of tokens = 27

Average dependency distance = 95 / 27 â‰ˆ 3.52
```

**Average Dependency Distance: 3.52**
