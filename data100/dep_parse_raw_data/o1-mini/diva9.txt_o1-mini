### **Explanation of Dependency Relations:**

- **Main Clause:**
  - **"concludes" (3)** is the root of the sentence.
  - **"study" (2)** is the subject (`nsubj`) of **"concludes" (3)**.
  - **"in" (4)** is a prepositional modifier (`prep`) attached to **"concludes" (3)**.
  - **"that" (5)** introduces the subordinate clause, attached to **"in" (4)**.

- **Subordinate Clause:**
  - **"is" (18)** is the main verb (`cop`) of the subordinate clause.
  - **"sense" (8)** is the subject (`nsubj`) of **"is" (18)**.
  - **"relevant" (20)** is the predicate adjective (`attr`) linked to **"is" (18)**.
  - **"present" (22)** is coordinated (`conj`) with **"relevant" (20)** via **"and" (21)**.
  - **"practice" (27)** is the object of the preposition **"in" (23)**, which modifies **"present" (22)**.
  - **Modifiers** such as **"highly" (19)**, **"Swedish" (24)**, **"municipal" (25)**, and **"planning" (26)** further describe their respective heads.

- **Punctuation:**
  - Punctuation marks like **"‘" (6)**, **"’" (11)**, **"," (17)**, and **"." (28)** are attached to relevant tokens to maintain the sentence structure.

### **Average Dependency Distance Calculation:**

The **dependency distance** for each token is calculated as the absolute difference between the token's index and its head's index. The distances for all tokens are as follows:

```
1: |1 - 2| = 1
2: |2 - 3| = 1
3: |3 - 0| = 3
4: |4 - 3| = 1
5: |5 - 4| = 1
6: |6 - 8| = 2
7: |7 - 8| = 1
8: |8 - 18| = 10
9: |9 - 8| = 1
10: |10 - 9| = 1
11: |11 - 8| = 3
12: |12 - 13| = 1
13: |13 - 8| = 5
14: |14 - 13| = 1
15: |15 - 16| = 1
16: |16 - 14| = 2
17: |17 - 18| = 1
18: |18 - 3| = 15
19: |19 - 20| = 1
20: |20 - 18| = 2
21: |21 - 20| = 1
22: |22 - 20| = 2
23: |23 - 22| = 1
24: |24 - 25| = 1
25: |25 - 26| = 1
26: |26 - 27| = 1
27: |27 - 23| = 4
28: |28 - 3| = 25
```

**Total Distance:** 90

**Number of Tokens:** 28

**Average Dependency Distance:**  
\[ \frac{90}{28} \approx 3.21 \]

### **Summary:**
- **Dependency Tree:** As listed above.
- **Average Dependency Distance:** **3.21**
