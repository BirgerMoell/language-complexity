Certainly! Let's analyze the provided sentence by breaking it down into tokens, establishing their dependencies, and calculating the average dependency distance.

### **Sentence:**
"Rising costs of energy, combined with an increasing environmental consciousness on the part of building owners, render timely the law on certification of buildings for energy efficiency."

### **Tokenization:**
The sentence is tokenized into 30 tokens, including punctuation marks.

| Index | Token           |
|-------|-----------------|
| 1     | Rising          |
| 2     | costs           |
| 3     | of              |
| 4     | energy          |
| 5     | ,               |
| 6     | combined        |
| 7     | with            |
| 8     | an              |
| 9     | increasing      |
| 10    | environmental   |
| 11    | consciousness   |
| 12    | on              |
| 13    | the             |
| 14    | part            |
| 15    | of              |
| 16    | building        |
| 17    | owners          |
| 18    | ,               |
| 19    | render          |
| 20    | timely          |
| 21    | the             |
| 22    | law             |
| 23    | on              |
| 24    | certification    |
| 25    | of              |
| 26    | buildings       |
| 27    | for             |
| 28    | energy          |
| 29    | efficiency      |
| 30    | .               |

### **Dependency Tree:**
Each token is associated with its head (governor) in the sentence. The head of the root token is indicated by `0`.

```python
[
    (1, "Rising", 2),
    (2, "costs", 19),
    (3, "of", 2),
    (4, "energy", 3),
    (5, ",", 4),
    (6, "combined", 2),
    (7, "with", 6),
    (8, "an", 11),
    (9, "increasing", 11),
    (10, "environmental", 11),
    (11, "consciousness", 7),
    (12, "on", 11),
    (13, "the", 14),
    (14, "part", 12),
    (15, "of", 14),
    (16, "building", 17),
    (17, "owners", 15),
    (18, ",", 17),
    (19, "render", 0),
    (20, "timely", 19),
    (21, "the", 22),
    (22, "law", 19),
    (23, "on", 22),
    (24, "certification", 23),
    (25, "of", 24),
    (26, "buildings", 25),
    (27, "for", 26),
    (28, "energy", 29),
    (29, "efficiency", 27),
    (30, ".", 29)
]
```

### **Average Dependency Distance Calculation:**
The dependency distance for each token is the absolute difference between its index and the index of its head. The average is computed by summing all individual distances and dividing by the total number of tokens.

| Token | Head Index | |Index - Head Index| |
|-------|------------|-----------------------|
| 1     | 2          | 1                     |
| 2     | 19         | 17                    |
| 3     | 2          | 1                     |
