]
```

**Average Dependency Distance:**
```
2.63
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Tokenization:** The sentence was tokenized into 27 tokens, including punctuation marks.

2. **Dependency Relations:** Each token was assigned a head token based on its grammatical role within the sentence. For example, "Most" (1) is a modifier of "laws" (5), so its head is token 5.

3. **Average Dependency Distance Calculation:**
   - For each token, the absolute difference between its index and its head's index was calculated.
   - The sum of all these distances is 71.
   - The average dependency distance is then computed as 71 divided by 27, resulting in approximately 2.63.

This analysis provides a clear structural understanding of the sentence, highlighting how each word relates to others within the grammatical framework.
