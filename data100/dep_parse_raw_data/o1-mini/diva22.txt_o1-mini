Certainly! Let's analyze the provided sentence by constructing its dependency tree and calculating the average dependency distance.

**Sentence:**
"The essay describes the need for solutions in offices in form of accessories that support an activity-based approach."

### Step 1: Tokenization
First, we'll tokenize the sentence, including punctuation marks.

| Index | Token          |
|-------|----------------|
| 1     | The            |
| 2     | essay          |
| 3     | describes      |
| 4     | the            |
| 5     | need           |
| 6     | for            |
| 7     | solutions      |
| 8     | in             |
| 9     | offices        |
| 10    | in             |
| 11    | form           |
| 12    | of             |
| 13    | accessories    |
| 14    | that           |
| 15    | support        |
| 16    | an             |
| 17    | activity-based |
| 18    | approach       |
| 19    | .              |

### Step 2: Dependency Parsing
We'll assign a head (governor) to each token based on grammatical relationships. The head is represented by the index of the governing token.

| Index | Token          | Head Index |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| 1     | The            | 2          |
| 2     | essay          | 3          |
| 3     | describes      | 0          | *(Root)*
| 4     | the            | 5          |
| 5     | need           | 3          |
| 6     | for            | 5          |
| 7     | solutions      | 6          |
| 8     | in             | 9          |
| 9     | offices        | 7          |
| 10    | in             | 11         |
| 11    | form           | 9          |
| 12    | of             | 13         |
| 13    | accessories    | 11         |
| 14    | that           | 15         |
| 15    | support        | 13         |
| 16    | an             | 17         |
| 17    | activity-based | 18         |
| 18    | approach       | 15         |
| 19    | .              | 3          |

**Dependency Tree Representation:**
```python
[
    (1, "The", 2),
    (2, "essay", 3),
    (3, "describes", 0),
    (4, "the", 5),
    (5, "need", 3),
    (6, "for", 5),
    (7, "solutions", 6),
    (8, "in", 9),
    (9, "offices", 7),
    (10, "in", 11),
    (11, "form", 9),
    (12, "of", 13),
    (13, "accessories", 11),
    (14, "that", 15),
    (15, "support", 13),
    (16, "an", 17),
    (17, "activity-based", 18),
    (18, "approach", 15),
    (19, ".", 3)
]
```

### Step 3: Calculating Average Dependency Distance
The dependency distance for each token is the absolute difference between its index and its head index.

| Index | Token          | Head Index | Distance |
|-------|----------------|------------|----------|
| 1     | The            | 2          | 1        |
| 2     | essay          | 3          | 1        |
| 3     | describes      | 0          | 3        |
| 4     | the            | 5          | 1        |
| 5     | need           | 3          | 2        |
| 6     | for            | 5          | 1        |
| 7     | solutions      | 6          | 1        |
| 8     | in             | 9          | 1        |
| 9     | offices        | 7          | 2        |
| 10    | in             | 11         | 1        |
| 11    | form           | 9          | 2        |
| 12    | of             | 13         | 1        |
| 13    | accessories    | 11         | 2        |
| 14    | that           | 15         | 1        |
| 15    | support        | 13         | 2        |
| 16    | an             | 17         | 1        |
| 17    | activity-based | 18         | 1        |
| 18    | approach       | 15         | 3        |
| 19    | .              | 3          | 16       |

**Note:** The punctuation mark "." has a significant dependency distance as it's linked to the main verb "describes."

**Total Distance:** 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 16 = 36

**Number of Tokens:** 19

**Average Dependency Distance:** 36 / 19 â‰ˆ 1.89

### **Final Results**

- **Dependency Tree:**
  ```python
  [
      (1, "The", 2),
      (2, "essay", 3),
      (3, "describes", 0),
      (4, "the", 5),
      (5, "need", 3),
      (6, "for", 5),
      (7, "solutions", 6),
      (8, "in", 9),
      (9, "offices", 7),
      (10, "in", 11),
      (11, "form", 9),
      (12, "of", 13),
      (13, "accessories", 11),
      (14, "that", 15),
      (15, "support", 13),
      (16, "an", 17),
      (17, "activity-based", 18),
      (18, "approach", 15),
      (19, ".", 3)
  ]
  ```

- **Average Dependency Distance:** Approximately **1.89**
