### Average Dependency Distance
**2.42**

### Explanation

- **Token Indexing**: Each word and punctuation mark in the sentence is assigned a unique index from 1 to 26.
  
- **Head Assignment**: For each token, the head is determined based on the syntactic structure of the sentence. For example:
  - "Ramar" (1) is the subject of "tas" (3), so its head is 3.
  - "men" (5) is a coordinating conjunction connecting "tas" (3) and "är" (6), so its head is 3.
  - The period (26) is attached to "tas" (3), resulting in a larger dependency distance.

- **Average Dependency Distance Calculation**:
  - Compute the absolute difference between each token's index and its head's index.
  - Sum all these differences: **63**
  - Divide by the number of tokens: **63 / 26 ≈ 2.42**

This average provides an overview of the syntactic complexity of the sentence, with larger values indicating longer dependencies between words.
