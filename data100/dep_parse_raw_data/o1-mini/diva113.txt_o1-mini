**Explanation of Dependencies:**
- **Main Clause (`we believe that...`):**
  - `believe` (14) is the root of the sentence.
  - `we` (13) is the subject of `believe`.
  - `that` (15) introduces the subordinate clause and is attached to `believe`.
  
- **Subordinate Clause (`that a major, costly investigation is not necessary`):**
  - `is` (21) is the main verb of the subordinate clause and is attached to `that` (15).
  - `investigation` (20) is the subject of `is`.
  - `necessary` (23) is the predicate adjective linked to `is`.
  - `a` (16), `major` (17), and `costly` (19) are modifiers of `investigation`.
  - The comma (18) is attached to `costly` (19).

- **Conditional Clause (`If the actual energy consumption is significantly below the reference value,`):**
  - `If` (1) is a subordinating conjunction attached to `is` (6).
  - `consumption` (5) is the subject of `is` (6).
  - `below` (8) is the predicate of `is` (6), with `significantly` (7) modifying `below`.
  - `the reference value` (tokens 9-11) serves as the object of `below`.
  - The comma (12) is attached to `below` (8).

**Average Dependency Distance Calculation:**

To compute the average dependency distance, calculate the absolute difference between each token's index and its head's index, then average these values.
