**Explanation:**

- **Tokenization:** The sentence was tokenized into 17 tokens, including punctuation marks.
  
- **Dependency Relations:**
  - Each tuple represents `(token index, token, head index)`.
  - The head index refers to the position of the head word that governs the current token.
  - For example, `(1, Resultatet, 2)` means that "Resultatet" (token 1) is dependent on "är" (token 2).

- **Average Dependency Distance Calculation:**
  - For each token, the dependency distance is the absolute difference between its index and its head index.
  - Summing all individual distances and dividing by the total number of tokens gives the average dependency distance.
  - In this case, the total distance is 44, and there are 17 tokens, resulting in an average distance of approximately **2.59**.
