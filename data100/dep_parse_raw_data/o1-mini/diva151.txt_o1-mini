Here is the dependency analysis of the provided sentence:

**Sentence:**
>An academic benchmark case (Unsteady Aerodynamics Experiment Phase III) was selected as a starting point of the optimization because wind tunnel data was available for that campaign.

**Dependency Tree:**

**Average Dependency Distance:**
3.23

**Explanation:**

- **Tokens and Head Indices:** Each tuple represents a token in the sentence with its position index, the token itself, and the index of its head (governor) in the dependency tree.
  
- **Punctuation:** Punctuation marks such as parentheses `(` and `)` and the period `.` are treated as separate tokens and linked to their appropriate heads.
  
- **Average Dependency Distance Calculation:** The dependency distance for each token is the absolute difference between its index and its head's index. Summing all these distances and dividing by the total number of tokens (30) results in an average dependency distance of approximately **3.23**.
