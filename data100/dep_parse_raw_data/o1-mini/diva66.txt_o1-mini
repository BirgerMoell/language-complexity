### Calculation of Average Dependency Distance

To compute the average dependency distance, calculate the absolute difference between each token's index and its head's index, then take the average of these distances.

| Token | Index | Head Index | Distance |
|-------|-------|------------|----------|
| Possible | 1 | 2 | 1 |
| reasons | 2 | 3 | 1 |
| include | 3 | 0 | 3 |
| unclear | 4 | 5 | 1 |
| responsibilities | 5 | 3 | 2 |
| ; | 6 | 3 | 3 |
| short-term | 7 | 9 | 2 |
| economic | 8 | 9 | 1 |
| focus | 9 | 3 | 6 |
| ; | 10 | 3 | 7 |
| a | 11 | 14 | 3 |
| fragmentized | 12 | 14 | 2 |
| building | 13 | 14 | 1 |
| process | 14 | 3 | 11 |
| ; | 15 | 3 | 12 |
| and | 16 | 3 | 13 |
| lack | 17 | 3 | 14 |
| of | 18 | 17 | 1 |
| proper | 19 | 20 | 1 |
| training | 20 | 18 | 2 |
| and | 21 | 20 | 1 |
| competence | 22 | 21 | 1 |
| . | 23 | 3 | 20 |

**Total Distance:** 109  
**Number of Tokens:** 23  
**Average Dependency Distance:** 109 / 23 â‰ˆ **4.74**
