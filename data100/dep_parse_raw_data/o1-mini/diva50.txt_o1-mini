### Average Dependency Distance
The **average dependency distance** for the sentence is **2.70**.

**Calculation Details:**

1. **Compute the absolute difference** between each token's index and its head's index.
2. **Sum all the differences**.
3. **Divide by the total number of tokens** (27 in this case).

\[
\text{Average Dependency Distance} = \frac{73}{27} \approx 2.70
\]
