Here is the dependency tree for the given sentence:

```
[
  (1, Even, 2),
  (2, though, 9),
  (3, it’s, 4),
  (4, young, 2),
  (5, ,, 9),
  (6, it, 9),
  (7, has, 9),
  (8, already, 9),
  (9, transformed, 0),
  (10, itself, 9),
  (11, multiple, 12),
  (12, times, 9),
  (13, and, 9),
  (14, survived, 9),
  (15, both, 18),
  (16, super, 17),
  (17, expansive, 18),
  (18, growth, 14),
  (19, and, 18),
  (20, fire, 14),
  (21, and, 20),
  (22, depression, 14),
  (23, ., 9)
]
```

### Average Dependency Distance

To calculate the average dependency distance, compute the absolute difference between each token's index and its head's index, then average these values.

**Calculations:**

1. |1 - 2| = 1
2. |2 - 9| = 7
3. |3 - 4| = 1
4. |4 - 2| = 2
5. |5 - 9| = 4
6. |6 - 9| = 3
7. |7 - 9| = 2
8. |8 - 9| = 1
9. |9 - 0| = 9
10. |10 - 9| = 1
11. |11 - 12| = 1
12. |12 - 9| = 3
13. |13 - 9| = 4
14. |14 - 9| = 5
15. |15 - 18| = 3
16. |16 - 17| = 1
17. |17 - 18| = 1
18. |18 - 14| = 4
19. |19 - 18| = 1
20. |20 - 14| = 6
21. |21 - 20| = 1
22. |22 - 14| = 8
23. |23 - 9| = 14

**Total Distance:** 83

**Number of Tokens:** 23

**Average Dependency Distance:** 83 / 23 ≈ **3.61**
