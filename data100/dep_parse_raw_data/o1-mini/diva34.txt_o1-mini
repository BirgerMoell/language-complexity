### Average Dependency Distance

To compute the average dependency distance, we calculate the absolute difference between each token's index and its head's index, sum all these distances, and then divide by the total number of tokens.

1. **Calculations:**

| Token Index | Head Index | Distance |
|-------------|------------|----------|
| 1           | 5          | |1-5| = 4   |
| 2           | 5          | |2-5| = 3   |
| 3           | 4          | |3-4| = 1   |
| 4           | 5          | |4-5| = 1   |
| 5           | 0          | |5-0| = 5   |
| 6           | 4          | |6-4| = 2   |
| 7           | 6          | |7-6| = 1   |
| 8           | 7          | |8-7| = 1   |
| 9           | 8          | |9-8| = 1   |
| 10          | 11         | |10-11| = 1  |
| 11          | 9          | |11-9| = 2   |
| 12          | 19         | |12-19| = 7  |
| 13          | 19         | |13-19| = 6  |
| 14          | 13         | |14-13| = 1  |
| 15          | 14         | |15-14| = 1  |
| 16          | 15         | |16-15| = 1  |
| 17          | 18         | |17-18| = 1  |
| 18          | 16         | |18-16| = 2  |
| 19          | 11         | |19-11| = 8  |
| 20          | 19         | |20-19| = 1  |
| 21          | 20         | |21-20| = 1  |
| 22          | 23         | |22-23| = 1  |
| 23          | 21         | |23-21| = 2  |
| 24          | 5          | |24-5| = 19 |

2. **Total Distance:** 
   
   \( 4 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 8 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 19 = 73 \)

3. **Average Dependency Distance:**
   
   \( \frac{73}{24} \approx 3.04 \)

### Summary

- **Dependency Tree:** As shown above.
- **Average Dependency Distance:** Approximately **3.04**
