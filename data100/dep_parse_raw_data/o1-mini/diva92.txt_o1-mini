    (24, ".", 17)
]
```

**Average Dependency Distance:**

To calculate the average dependency distance, compute the absolute difference between each token's index and its head's index, sum all these differences, and divide by the total number of tokens.

- **Sum of Dependency Distances:** 100
- **Number of Tokens:** 24
- **Average Dependency Distance:** 100 / 24 ≈ **4.17**
