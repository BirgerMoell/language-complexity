```

### Average Dependency Distance
The average dependency distance for the sentence is **2.68**.

---

**Calculation Details:**

Each token's dependency distance is the absolute difference between its index and its head's index. Summing these distances for all tokens and dividing by the total number of tokens (28) yields the average dependency distance.

**Example Calculation:**
- Token 1: |1 - 2| = 1
- Token 2: |2 - 8| = 6
- ...
- Token 28: |28 - 8| = 20

Total Dependency Distance: 75  
Average Dependency Distance: 75 / 28 â‰ˆ 2.68
