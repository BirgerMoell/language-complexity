The sentence you provided is in English, not Swedish. Nevertheless, I will still create a dependency tree for it.

Here's a breakdown of the sentence:

1. Most
2. of
3. the
4. environmental
5. laws
6. that
7. were
8. studied
9. are
10. parts
11. of
12. the
13. legal
14. framework
15. ,
16. which
17. means
18. that
19. no
20. exact
21. limits
22. or
23. detailed
24. guidelines
25. are
26. given
27. .

The dependency tree is:

[(1, Most, 0), (2, of, 4), (3, the, 4), (4, environmental, 5), (5, laws, 7), (6, that, 7), (7, were, 9), (8, studied, 9), (9, are, 25), (10, parts, 25), (11, of, 13), (12, the, 13), (13, legal, 14), (14, framework, 25), (15, , 17), (16, which, 17), (17, means, 25), (18, that, 25), (19, no, 21), (20, exact, 21), (21, limits, 25), (22, or, 25), (23, detailed, 24), (24, guidelines, 25), (25, are, 26), (26, given, 0), (27, ., 0)]

However, please note that this is just one possible dependency tree. Dependency parsing can be done in different ways and the actual tree might depend on the parsing model and its parameters.

In general, I have made the following decisions:
- "Most" seems to be an adverb, I have decided to omit it in this parsing since it does not add much value to the dependency tree.
- "framework" is an argument of the verb "means" in a more general sense, it could be argued that it is not directly connected.
- Both instances of "that" seem to introduce a dependent clause and could therefore be seen as a conjunction.
- The relative clause "which means that..." modifies the "framework" so both "are given" and "are parts of" could be the head.
- The last "are" and "given" could also be argued as joined by the previous conjunction.
