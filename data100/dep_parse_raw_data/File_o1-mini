Certainly! Let's analyze the provided sentence and generate its dependency tree as specified.

**Sentence:** Longest Sentence

### Tokenization
First, we'll tokenize the sentence, including any punctuation. Since there is no punctuation in this sentence, the tokens are:

1. Longest
2. Sentence

### Dependency Tree
Now, we'll assign head indices based on the syntactic structure:

1. **Longest** (Token 1) modifies **Sentence** (Token 2).
2. **Sentence** (Token 2) is the root of the sentence.

This results in the following dependency tree:

```plaintext
[(1, Longest, 2), (2, Sentence, 0)]
```

### Average Dependency Distance
To compute the average dependency distance:

1. **Longest** (1) → **Sentence** (2): Distance = |1 - 2| = 1
2. **Sentence** (2) → Root (0): Distance = |2 - 0| = 2

**Total Distance:** 1 + 2 = 3

**Number of Dependencies:** 2

**Average Dependency Distance:** 3 / 2 = **1.5**

---

**Summary:**

- **Dependency Tree:** `[(1, Longest, 2), (2, Sentence, 0)]`
- **Average Dependency Distance:** `1.5`
