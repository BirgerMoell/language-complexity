To analyze the given Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, I'll use a simplified syntax-based approach. Below is the breakdown of the sentence with the token index, token, and head token index.

1. Den - (1, Den, 2) [subject]
2. del - (2, del, 0) [root]
3. av - (3, av, 2) [prepositional phrase]
4. koden - (4, koden, 3) [object of preposition]
5. som - (5, som, 2) [subordinating conjunction]
6. ger - (6, ger, 5) [verb]
7. order - (7, order, 6) [object]
8. om - (8, om, 6) [prepositional phrase]
9. andra - (9, andra, 11) [attribute]
10. saker - (10, saker, 8) [object of preposition (incorrect) - should be the head of 'andra']
   Corrected Dependency: (9, andra, 10)
   Corrected Dependency: (10, saker, 8)
11. utöver - (11, utöver, 12) (preposition, 'att' is implied and connects to the action) 
   att - (implied 12, 'att', 11) [ connect the implied 'att' before]
12. att - Not physically present in the sentence, but before sprida
   sprida - Not physically present in the dependency - insert it
   sprida och gömma sig - verb phrase 
   In the given sentence sprida 'sprida' is the root of the dependency - verb phrase
   So sprida's head index is 12 (Not available) 'utöver', it should be the head - root
   Dependency for 'sprida', the root will be - 
   the verb 'ger' index 6 is the dependent for sprida - att 
   ger - depends on att - 
   the action ger depends on (Sprida/gömmer), 
   actually, 'andra' depends on root - last part of the sentence.
   This part with multiple verb, implies - the action verb depends on Sub-Root of verb 
   This correction should reflect as 
   Not Corrected yet for 'att', use it to connect other parts. So we set (11, utöver,  12 will set by other verb phrase 
   Action Verbs (sprida och (gömmer))' which does fit (as 'att' connector). Finally, 
   we set to 6 -  sprida/gömmer head 
   but the 12 at which  will assign it as depend under ger action since, there might be some error if we set any other value

Please re-set 11 part utöver head on 6 - depends on ger
'utöver' prepositions - head be set on verb ('Ger' (6)) where verb might also depend -   which does work root the utöver connection by use sub node.
