To create a dependency tree for the given Swedish sentence, we'll break it down into its constituent parts and assign a head to each token. Here is the analysis:

1. AfrikaEkvatorn - This is a compound word, which can be broken down into Afrika and Ekvatorn. However, since they are combined into one word, we'll treat it as a single token.
2. går - The main verb of the sentence, 'går' is the head of the initial clause.
3. rakt - This is an adverb modifying 'går', so 'går' is the head of 'rakt'.
4. igenom - This is a preposition that takes 'Afrika' as its complement, but the whole phrase 'rakt igenom Afrika' functions as a modifier to the verb 'går', so 'går' is the head of 'igenom' as well.
5. Afrika - The complement of the preposition 'igenom'. 'igenom' is the head of 'Afrika'.
6. , - This comma is a punctuation mark, which can be treated as a token in its own right, but in this context, we can assign it as a dependent of the main verb 'går', as it indicates a pause or break in the sentence.
7. därför - This is an adverbial conjunction that introduces the next clause, so it has no head in the context of the first clause, but when analyzed together with the rest of the sentence, it can be argued to function as a modifier to the verb 'går' again, due to the continuation of the thought.
8. ligger - The main verb of the second clause, 'ligger' is the head of this clause.
9. Afrika - The subject of the verb 'ligger'. 'ligger' is the head of 'Afrika'.
10. i - This is a preposition that takes the phrase 'den tropiska och subtropiska zonen' as its complement. 'ligger' is the head of 'i', as 'i + complement' functions to describe a location.
11. den - A determiner modifying the noun 'tropiska och subtropiska zonen', 'den' can be treated as a dependent of 'tropiska och subtropiska zonen'.
12. tropiska - The first half of the compound noun 'tropiska och subtropiska zonen'. We'll treat this compound as a single token 'tropiska och subtropiska zonen', so both parts of the compound take 'den' as their determiner.
13. och - This is a conjunction connecting the two parts of the compound 'tropiska and subtropiska'. 'tropiska och subtropiska zonen' can be argued to be the head of 'och', since 'och' is necessary to express both parts of the compound.
14. subtropiska - The second half of the compound noun.
15. zonen - The head noun of the compound phrase.
16. , - Another comma that separates independent clauses or thought. Again, we'll treat it as a dependent of the main verb 'ligger'.
17. vilket - This is a dependent clause introduced by a relative pronoun 'vilket', but since 'vilket' functions to introduce the subsequent clause, 'vilket' can be assigned 'gör' as its head in the following dependent clause.
18. som - This is a pronoun, and like 'vilket', it functions to introduce a dependent clause. Since it is closely tied to 'vilket' in introducing the same subordinate thought, we'll assign it directly to 'gör' as well.
19. gör - This is the verb of the dependent clause introduced by 'vilket' and 'som', which depends on the main verb 'gör'.
20. att - A subordinating conjunction introducing an infinitive phrase. Since this is part of the 'gör' clause, 'att' is a dependent of 'gör'.
21. Afrika - The subject of the verb in the infinitive phrase 'får ett väldigt varierat klimat'. As the main subject, it's related to the verb 'gör', and more closely to 'får', which should be its head.
22. får - The verb of the infinitive phrase, which depends on 'gör'.
23. ett - A determiner modifying the noun 'väldigt varierat klimat', which can be argued to be a dependent of the 'väldigt varierat klimat'.
24. väldigt - An adverb modifying the adjective 'varierat', it's dependent on 'varierat'.
25. varierat - An adjective modifying 'klimat', which is dependent on 'klimat'.
26. klimat - The head noun of the phrase.

Now we can create the dependency tree from the given analysis:
