To create the dependency tree, we need to analyze the sentence and its grammatical structure. The sentence "Sedan försökte jag sammanställa det till en relativt kort text." can be broken down into the following components:

- "Sedan" is an adverb indicating time or order.
- "försökte" is the main verb.
- "jag" is the subject.
- "sammanställa" is an infinitive verb that is the object of "försökte".
- "det" is an object of "sammanställa".
- "till" is a preposition indicating direction.
- "en" is an adjective modifying "text".
- "relativt" is an adverb modifying "kort".
- "kort" is an adjective modifying "text".
- "text" is the object of the preposition "till".
- The sentence is ending with a period.

Based on these components, we can create the following dependency tree:

[(1, Sedan, 2), (2, försökte, 0), (3, jag, 2), (4, sammanställa, 2), (5, det, 4), (6, till, 4), (7, en, 8), (8, relativt, 9), (9, kort, 10), (10, text, 6), (11, ., 0)]

However, since this isn't a perfect tree and "relativt" is not modifying "kort" directly but could be analyzed as having a dependency on "kort", we can get a perfect tree structure and improved sentence representation with:

[(1, Sedan, 2), (2, försökte, 0), (3, jag, 2), (4, sammanställa, 2), (5, det, 4), (6, till, 4), (7, en, 10), (8, relativt, 9), (9, relativt, 10), (10, kort, 10), (10, text, 6), (11, ., 0)]

or using a more common tree structure where we analyze "relativt" as having a root in "kort", and thus having only one true head dependency:

[(1, Sedan, 2), (2, försökte, 0), (3, jag, 2), (4, sammanställa, 2), (5, det, 4), (6, till, 4), (7, en, 10), (8, relativt, 9), (9, kort, 10), (10, text, 6), (11, ., 0)]

Note that a linguist specializing in Swedish grammar and syntax should be consulted for perfection in the analysis, as grammatical dependency parsing may be complex and nuanced.
