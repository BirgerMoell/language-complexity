To analyze the Swedish sentence, we'll break it down into its tokens and dependencies. Here is the annotated dependency tree:

[(1, Idag, 2), (2, är, 0), (3, vi, 2), (4, vana, 5), (5, vid, 2), (6, begreppet, 7), (7, resecentrum, 8), (8, som, 9), (9, med, 10), (10, stort, 11), (11, utbud, 9), (12, av, 11), (13, service, 12), (14, i, 15), (15, anslutning, 11), (16, till, 15), (17, tåg­, 18), (18, plattformar, 16), (19, ska, 20), (20, kunna, 19), (21, tillgodose, 20), (22, resenärernas, 23), (23, behov, 21), (24, i, 25), (25, samband, 21), (26, med, 25), (27, deras, 28), (28, resa, 26), (29, ., 2)]

This annotated dependency tree indicates the grammatical relationships within the sentence as follows:

* The sentence has a fairly complex subject ("Idag är vi vana vid begreppet resecentrum som...") with "är" as the main verb and the entire phrase dependent on it.
* "Vi" is the complement of "är", "vana" is a state described by "är", and "vid" is a preposition governing "begreppet resecentrum".
* "Som" is a subordinating conjunction introducing the dependent clause.
* Within the dependent clause, "med" is a preposition, "stort" is an adjective describing "utbud", "av" is a preposition governing "service", and "i" is a preposition governing "anslutning till tåg­plattformar".
* "Ska" is an auxiliary verb governing "kunna", and "tillgodose" is the main verb of the dependent clause, taking "resenärernas behov" as its direct object.
* "I samband med deras resa" is a prepositional phrase, which modifies "tillgodose".
* The entire sentence is concluded by a full stop (".").
