To analyze the Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, I will use a Universal Dependencies (UD) framework. Here's the analysis:

The sentence is: "Några virusmakare svarade själva:- Jag gör det för utmaningen att hitta det optimala uttrycket för min talang, svarade en."

1. Tokenize the sentence:
   1. Några
   2. virusmakare
   3. svarade
   4. själva
   5. :-
   6. Jag
   7. gör
   8. det
   9. för
   10. utmaningen
   11. att
   12. hitta
   13. det
   14. optimala
   15. uttrycket
   16. för
   17. min
   18. talang
   19. ,
   20. svarade
   21. en

2. Dependency tree:
   - 'Några' is a determiner (det) and its head is 'virusmakare' (2).
   - 'virusmakare' is the subject and its head is 'svarade' (3).
   - 'svarade' is a verb (ROOT) and its head is 0 (the root of the tree).
   - 'själva' is an adverb (advmod) and its head is 'svarade' (3).
   - ':-' is a punctuation mark (punct) and its head is 'svarade' (3).
   - 'Jag' is the subject and its head is 'gör' (7).
   - 'gör' is the main verb and its head is 0 (the root of the tree, conjoined with 'svarade').
   - 'det' is an object (dobj) and its head is 'gör' (7).
   - 'för' is a preposition (case) and its head is 'utmaningen' (10).
   - 'utmaningen' is an object (dobj) and its head is 'gör' (7).
   - 'att' is a subordinating conjunction (mark) and its head is 'hitta' (12).
   - 'hitta' is a verb (conj) and its head is 'gör' (7).
   - 'det' is an object (dobj) and its head is 'hitta' (12).
   - 'optimala' is an adjective (amod) and its head is 'uttrycket' (15).
   - 'uttrycket' is an object (dobj) and its head is 'hitta' (12).
   - 'för' is a preposition (case) and its head is 'min' (17), with a fixed expression or idiom in mind.
   - 'min' is a determiner (det) and its head is 'talang' (18).
   - 'talang' is an object (dobj) and its head is 'hitta' (12).
   - ',' is a punctuation mark (punct) and its head is 'hitta' (12).
   - 'svarade' is the main verb (ROOT) and its head is 0 (the root of the tree, conjoined with the first 'svarade' and 'gör').
   - 'en' is the subject and its head is 'svarade' (20).

The dependency tree is represented as follows:
   [(1, Några, 2), (2, virusmakare, 3), (3, svarade, 0), (4, själva, 3), 
    (5, :-, 3), (6, Jag, 7), (7, gör, 0), (8, det, 7), (9, för, 10), 
    (10, utmaningen, 7), (11, att, 12), (12, hitta, 7), (13, det, 12), 
    (14, optimala, 15), (15, uttrycket, 12), (16, för, 17), (17, min, 18), 
    (18, talang, 12), (19, , 12), (20, svarade, 0), (21, en, 20)]
