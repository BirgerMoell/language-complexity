To produce a dependency tree for the given sentence, we need to parse the sentence into its constituent parts and determine the grammatical relationships between them. Here's a possible dependency tree for the sentence:

[(1, Vilket, 6), 
 (2, tidigare, 6), 
 (3, motsvarade, 0), 
 (4, att, 5), 
 (5, man, 3), 
 (6, fick, 3), 
 (7, ägna, 6), 
 (8, timmar, 7), 
 (9, kanske, 10), 
 (10, dagar, 7), 
 (11, åt, 12), 
 (12, att, 7), 
 (13, läsa, 12), 
 (14, igenom, 15), 
 (15, rad, 17), 
 (16, efter, 17), 
 (17, rad, 13), 
 (18, för, 20), 
 (19, att, 20), 
 (20, hitta, 3), 
 (21, vad, 23), 
 (22, man, 23), 
 (23, sökte, 20), 
 (24, ., 3)]

Here's a breakdown of the relationships between the tokens in the sentence:
- "Vilket" and "tidigare" both depend on "motsvarade".
- "Motsvarade" is the root verb of the sentence, with "att" and "fick" depending on it as an infinitive and main verb, respectively.
- "Fick" has several dependents: "man" as the subject, "ägna" as an infinitive, and "timmar" and "dagar" as objects (both nouns), with "kanske" modifying "dagar".
- "Ägna" is dependent on "fick" and has its own dependent "åt", which in turn has the infinitive "att" as its dependent.
- "Att" has the verb "läsa" as its dependent, which in turn has the adverb "igenom" and the noun "rad" as dependents.
- "Rad" has the prepositional phrase "rad efter" as its dependent, with "rad" being the object of the preposition "efter".
- "Läsa" also has the adverb "för" as a dependent, which has the infinitive "att" and the verb "hitta" as its dependents.
- "Hitta" has the direct object "vad" (which is modified by "man"), which in turn is dependent on the verb "sökte".
- The sentence terminates with a period.

Please note that this is just one possible way of parsing the sentence. Different grammatical theories or parsing algorithms may produce different results.
