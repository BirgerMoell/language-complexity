To analyze the sentence and create a dependency tree, let's first break the sentence into individual tokens:

Graffitimålarna (1) 
kan (2) 
ju (3) 
inte (4) 
köpa (5) 
någon (6) 
reklamplats (7) 
och (8) 
sätta (9) 
upp (10) 
stora (11) 
affischer (12) 
med (13) 
deras (14) 
tag (15) 
och (16) 
crew (17) 
, (18) 
så (19) 
istället (20) 
tar (21) 
de (22) 
sin (23) 
plats (24) 

The sentence can be divided into two main clauses:

- Graffitimålarna kan ju inte köpa någon reklamplats och sätta upp stora affischer med deras tag och crew 
- så istället tar de sin plats

Here is a breakdown of the dependency relationships between the tokens:

(2, kan, 5), 
(3, ju, 2), 
(4, inte, 5), 
(5, köpa, 0),
