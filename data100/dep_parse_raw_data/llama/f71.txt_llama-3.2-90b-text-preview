- "sa" is the main verb of the dependent clause.
- "tidigare" is an adverb modifying "sa".

Though giving the complete analysis of the above sentence as in format specified, was quite a bit of work, in general dependency parsing requires careful processing of a sentence as a whole; each word's possible roles and functions. Also as specified not everything that follows this format and the above results are put as is for the specified request.
