To analyze the Swedish sentence "Det högsta födelsetalet är i Väst och Östafrika, som också hade den högsta tillväxten (2." and produce a dependency tree from it, we need to parse the sentence into its constituent parts and identify the grammatical relationships between them.

5. i (i, 6)
6. Väst (Väst, 8)
7. och (och, 6)
