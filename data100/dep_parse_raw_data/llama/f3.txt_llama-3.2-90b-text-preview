To analyze the given Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we'll go through it step by step. Here's the breakdown:

1. "Under" is a preposition and "kolonialstyrelsen" is the object, so "Under" is a dependent of "kolonialstyrelsen".
2. "Som" is an adverb, "sagt" is the verb, and this phrase is a dependent of the main clause.
3. "så" is an adverb, "erövrade" is the verb, and it's the main verb of the sentence.
4. "Portugal" is the subject, and it's a dependent of "erövrade".
5. "Brasilien" is the direct object, and it's a dependent of "erövrade".
6. "på 1500-talet" is an adverbial phrase modifying "erövrade", and "på" is a preposition, and "1500-talet" is the object.
7. "men" is a conjunction, and it's a dependent of the sentence root (in this case, "erövrade" or the main clause).
8. "inte" is an adverb, "förrän" is a conjunction, "år 1530" is an adverbial phrase modifying "förrän", and it's a dependent of the sentence.
9. "började" is the verb, and it's the main verb of the second clause.
10. "man" is the subject, and it's a dependent of "började".
11. "visa" is not present in the original sentence but implied by "något" and it is the verb, and it's a dependent of "började".
12. "något" is an adjective, and it's a dependent of the implied verb "visa".
13. "intresse" is the object, and it's a dependent of the implied verb "visa".
14. "för" is a preposition, and "sin" is an adjective, and "koloni" is the object.
15. "Som sagt" and the whole phrase "Under kolonialstyrelsen" are sentence initial phrases that depend on the main clause.

Here's the dependency tree:

[(0, Under, 6), 
(1, kolonialstyrelsen, 3), 
(2, :, 3), 
(3, Som, 9), 
(4, sagt, 3), 
(5, så, 6), 
(6, erövrade, 0), 
(7, Portugal, 6), 
(8, Brasilien, 6), 
(9, på, 11), 
(10, 1500-talet, 9), 
(11, men, 6), 
(12, inte, 15), 
(13, förrän, 15), 
(14, år, 16), 
(15, 1530, 13), 
(16, så, 18), 
(17, började, 6), 
(18, man, 17), 
(19, visa, 17, implied verb), 
(20, något, 19), 
(21, intresse, 19), 
(22, för, 24), 
(23, sin, 24), 
(24, koloni, 19)]

Note: 0 represents the root of the sentence which is the main clause "erövrade Portugal Brasilien", and 19 represents the implied verb "visa" which does not appear in the dependency tree but it's used here for explanation.
