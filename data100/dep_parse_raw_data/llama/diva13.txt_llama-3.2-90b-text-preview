The given sentence is in English, not Swedish. 

However, I can still analyze the sentence and produce a dependency tree for it. Here's the output:

[(1, This, 2), (2, led, 0), (3, to, 4), (4, questions, 2), (5, about, 4), (6, how, 8), (7, the, 9), (8, outbound, 9), (9, logistics, 6), (10, is, 11), (11, planned, 6), (12, in, 11), (13, Zwolle, 12), (14, today, 11), (15, and, 11), (16, how, 18), (17, it, 18), (18, can, 15), (19, be, 20), (20, planned, 18), (21, in, 20), (22, the, 23), (23, future, 21), (24, with, 20), (25, increased, 26), (26, production, 27), (27, volumes, 24), (28, ., 2)]

Here's a brief description of each dependency label:

- The subject-verb dependency: The subject (This) is dependent on the verb (led), index 2.
- The prepositional phrase dependency: The preposition (to) is dependent on the noun phrase (questions), index 4.
- The adjunct dependency: The adverbial clause (how the outbound logistics is planned in Zwolle today) and (how it can be planned in the future with increased production volumes) are dependent on the verb (led), index 2.
- The modifier dependency: The adjective (outbound) and (increased) are dependent on the noun (logistics) and (production volumes), index 9 and 26.

Note that this dependency tree uses a simplified set of labels and does not reflect the full complexity of the sentence's syntax. For a more accurate and detailed analysis, it would be necessary to use a more advanced dependency scheme.
