To analyze the given Swedish sentence and create a dependency tree, we'll break down the sentence into its constituent parts and identify the grammatical relationships between them.

The sentence is: "I Atlanten lever ca 1 500 olika djurarter medan det i Östersjön bara finns ca 80, ."

Here's the tokenized sentence with their corresponding indices:

1. I
2. Atlanten
3. lever
4. ca
5. 1
6. 500
7. olika
8. djurarter
9. medan
10. det
11. i
12. Östersjön
13. bara
14. finns
15. ca
16. 80
17. , 
18. .

Now, let's create the dependency tree:

- "I" is a preposition and depends on the noun "Atlanten" (index 2).
- "Atlanten" is the object of the preposition "I" and depends on the verb "lever" (index 3).
- "lever" is the main verb of the sentence and is the head of the sentence (index 0).
- "ca" is an adverb and modifies the numeral "1" (index 5).
- "1" is part of a numeral phrase and depends on the numeral "500" (index 6).
- "500" is part of a numeral phrase and depends on the noun "djurarter" (index 8).
- "olika" is an adjective and modifies the noun "djurarter" (index 8).

- "medan" is a conjunction and introduces the subordinate clause.

Here is the resulting dependency tree:

[(1, I, 2), 
 (2, Atlanten, 3), 
 (3, lever, 0), 
 (4, ca, 5), 
 (5, 1, 6), 
 (6, 500, 8), 
 (7, olika, 8), 
 (8, djurarter, 3), 
 (9, medan, 3), 
 (10, det, 14), 
 (11, i, 12), 
 (12, Östersjön, 14), 
 (13, bara, 14), 
 (14, finns, 3), 
 (15, ca, 16), 
 (16, 80, 14), 
 (17, , , 14), 
 (18, ., 3)]
