First, let's break down the given sentence into individual tokens with their indices. We will treat the entire sentence as a single string and assign each word and punctuation mark a unique index.

1. An
2. IPM
3. from
4. International
5. Rectifier
6. has
7. been
8. modified
9. and
10. tested
11. by
12. letting
13. the
14. IPM
15. drive
16. a
17. permanent
18. magnet
19. motor
20. under
21. typical
22. load
23. conditions
24. for
25. a
26. long
27. time
28. .
 

Next, we will analyze the dependencies. The main clause is "An IPM...has been modified and tested." The subject-verb relationship indicates that 'An IPM' (1-2) and 'has been modified and tested' (6-10) are core components.

'An' (1) is a determiner for 'IPM' (2), thus it should be attached to 'IPM'.

'Modified' (8) and 'tested' (10) are both verb forms that describe the state of 'IPM' and are connected by 'and'. So 'modified' is dependent on 'tested'. However, in a typical dependency tree, we would select one of them to attach to the head verb 'has' (6), usually opting for the first verb in this case.

The next part 'by letting the IPM drive a permanent magnet motor' is a subordinate clause explaining how 'the IPM' was 'tested'. This indicates a dependency of the main clause ('has been modified and tested') on this subordinate clause.

'under typical load conditions for a long time' is another prepositional phrase describing the manner and condition of testing.

'IPM' (14) is still dependent on 'drive' (15) which should be dependent on 'letting' (12).

'typical' (21) is an adjective modifying 'load conditions' (23), so 'typical' (21) and 'load' (22) have a dependency on 'conditions' (23).

 
Considering this, the dependency tree should be:
 
[(1, An, 2), 
(2, IPM, 6), 
(3, from, 5), 
(4, International, 5), 
(5, Rectifier, 6), 
(6, has, 0), 
(7, been, 6), 
(8, modified, 10), 
(9, and, 10), 
(10, tested, 6), 
(11, by, 12), 
(12, letting, 10), 
(13, the, 14), 
(14, IPM, 15), 
(15, drive, 12), 
(16, a, 19), 
(17, permanent, 19), 
(18, magnet, 19), 
(19, motor, 15), 
(20, under, 24), 
(21, typical, 23), 
(22, load, 23), 
(23, conditions, 24), 
(24, for, 27), 
(25, a, 27), 
(26, long, 27), 
(27, time, 24), 
(28, ., 0)]

Here the '0' denotes 'ROOT', meaning these tokens do not have a head in the sentence.
