The provided sentence is in English, not Swedish. To analyze the sentence, I will break it down into its components. Here's the sentence with token indices:

1. An
2. academic
3. benchmark
4. case
5. (
6. Unsteady
7. Aerodynamics
8. Experiment
9. Phase
10. III
11. )
12. was
13. selected
14. as
15. a
16. starting
17. point
18. of
19. the
20. optimization
21. because
22. wind
23. tunnel
24. data
25. was
26. available
27. for
28. that
29. campaign
30. .

Now, let's analyze the sentence and produce a dependency tree:

- "An" is an adjective modifying "academic", but in the dependency tree, it should be a dependent of "academic", which is then dependent on "benchmark case". So, (1, An, 2)
- "academic" is an adjective modifying "benchmark". So, (2, academic, 3)
- "benchmark" is an adjective modifying "case". So, (3, benchmark, 4)
- "case" is the head of the nominal phrase "academic benchmark case". Moreover, "case" is a dependent of "selected" via the relative clause or prepositional phrase, which implies that "case" is the primary noun being selected. However, for simplicity and based on the given example, we will consider "case" as a dependent of "selected" directly. So, (4, case, 13)
- "(" is a parenthesis, and its head is the first element of the parenthetical construction. However, we will assign its head based on the structure of the whole construction: in this case, "Unsteady Aerodynamics Experiment Phase III" is an appositive phrase providing additional information about "case". Therefore, for simplicity, we can assume the head of "(" is "13". However, given the structure, a better option would be the head is "4" as it is providing more information. Given an either-or scenario and an evaluation of both scenarios - for simplicity (4, case, 13) - we'll make a decision to choose head is "case" and thus parenthesis head "13" .  (5, (, 4) .
- "Unsteady" is an adjective modifying "Aerodynamics". So, (6, Unsteady, 7)
- "Aerodynamics" is a noun being modified and is dependent on "Experiment". (7, Aerodynamics, 8)
- "Experiment" is a noun being modified and is dependent on "Phase". (8, Experiment, 9)
- "Phase" is a noun being modified and is dependent on "III". (9, Phase, 10)
- "III" is the final dependant "Phase". 
- ")" parenthesis head is again the primary referenced clause that is the "13" but for consistent notation we'll referenced it "(4, case, 13)". (11, ), 4)
- "was" is a link verb, and its head is "selected". So, (12, was, 13)
- "selected" is the main verb of the sentence. So, its head is "0" (root of the tree). (13, selected, 0)
- "as" is a preposition introducing the prepositional phrase "a starting point of the optimization". So, its head is "selected". (14, as, 13)
- "a" is an article modifying "starting". So, (15, a, 16)
- "starting" is an adjective modifying "point". So, (16, starting, 17)
- "point" is the head of the nominal phrase "a starting point". Moreover, "point" is a dependent of "of". So, (17, point, 18)
- "of" is a preposition introducing the prepositional phrase "the optimization". So, its head is "point". As "point is part of prepositional head we'll referenced "13" (18, of, 13) 
- "the" is an article modifying "optimization". So, (19, the, 20)
- "optimization" is the head of the nominal phrase "the optimization". Moreover, "optimization" is a dependent of "of", which is dependent on the primary reference point. However for this notation simplicity, we will referenced "optimization" with "point" head, but assign a head "13".  (20, optimization, 13)
- "because" is a subordinating conjunction introducing the subordinate clause "because wind tunnel data was available for that campaign". So, its head is "selected". (21, because, 13)
- "wind" is a noun being modified and is dependent on "
