Based on the provided Swedish sentence "Man hyllar att F.", I'll create a dependency tree as requested. 

Here's the breakdown of the sentence:

- "Man" is the subject (nominative pronoun)
- "hyllar" is the verb (action of praising)
- "att" is a subordinating conjunction introducing a clause
- "F." is an abbreviation or a proper noun (lacking more context, it's difficult to determine its exact role)

Given this, here's a possible dependency tree:

[(1, Man, 2), (2, hyllar, 0), (3, att, 2), (4, F., 3), (5, ., 2)]

This tree implies the following relationships:

- The subject "Man" (1) depends on the verb "hyllar" (2)
- The verb "hyllar" (2) is the root of the sentence
- The subordinating conjunction "att" (3) depends on the verb "hyllar" (2)
- The abbreviation/noun "F." (4) likely depends on the subordinating conjunction "att" (3)
- The full stop/punctuation mark "." (5) typically depends on the sentence root or the verb "hyllar" (2)

Please note that this is a simplified analysis and may not fully capture the nuances of Swedish syntax. With more context or information about the sentence, the dependency tree could potentially be adjusted for accuracy.
