To analyze the Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we need to break down the sentence into individual tokens and identify the grammatical dependencies between them.

The sentence "Syfte Man blir mycket fascinerad av att läsa om Sveriges historia för man finner alltid nya intressanta saker precis hela tiden." can be tokenized as follows:

1. Syfte
2. Man
3. blir
4. mycket
5. fascinerad
6. av
7. att
8. läsa
9. om
10. Sveriges
11. historia
12. för
13. man
14. finner
15. alltid
16. nya
17. intressanta
18. saker
19. precis
20. hela
21. tiden
22. .

The dependency tree for this sentence is:

[(1, Syfte, 2), (2, Man, 0), (3, blir, 2), (4, mycket, 5), (5, fascinerad, 3), (6, av, 7), 
(7, att, 8), (8, läsa, 3), (9, om, 11), (10, Sveriges, 11), (11, historia, 8), 
(12, för, 14), (13, man, 14), (14, finner, 8), (15, alltid, 16), (16, nya, 17), 
(17, intressanta, 18), (18, saker, 14), (19, precis, 20), (20, hela, 21), 
(21, tiden, 14), (22, ., 2)]

In this dependency tree, the head token is indicated by the final number in each triple. A head token with index 0 indicates that the token is the root of the sentence.

Here's a brief description of each dependency relation:

- "Syfte" is a noun phrase and is attached to "Man" as a dependent.
- "Man" is the subject of the sentence and is attached to the root.
- "blir" is a verb and is attached to "Man" as the main verb.
- "mycket" is an adverb and is attached to "fascinerad" as an adverbial modifier.
- "fascinerad" is an adjective and is attached to "blir" as a complement.
- "av att läsa" is a prepositional phrase and is attached to "fascinerad" as a modifier.
- "om Sveriges historia" is a prepositional phrase and is attached to "läsa" as a modifier.
- "för man finner" is a subordinate clause and is attached to "läsa" as a subordinate clause.
- "saker precis hela tiden" is a noun phrase and is attached to "finner" as an object.

Note: The dependency tree can vary depending on the grammatical analysis and the specific dependency parsing algorithm used.
