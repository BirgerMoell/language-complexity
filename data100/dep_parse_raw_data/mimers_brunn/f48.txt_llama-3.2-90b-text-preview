To analyze the given Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we'll first identify the tokens in the sentence and then determine the grammatical dependencies between them. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

Tokens:
1. Då
2. ändrade
3. ordet
4. hacker
5. mening
6. till
7. att
8. betyda
9. ungefär
10. En
11. person
12. som
13. arbetar
14. och
15. sover
16. och
17. lever
18. med
19. datorer
20. .

Now, let's analyze the grammatical dependencies:

- 'Då' is a temporal adverb and functions as an adverbial modifier to the main clause.
- 'ändrade' is the verb and the main predicate of the sentence.
- 'ordet' is the subject of the sentence and the direct object of 'ändrade' is 'mening'.
- 'hacker' is an attributive modifier of 'ordet'.
- 'mening' is the direct object of 'ändrade'.
- 'till' is a preposition and introduces the infinitive phrase 'att betyda...' which is the complement of 'mening'.
- 'att' is the infinitive marker.
- 'betyda' is the infinitive verb of the infinitive phrase 'att betyda...'.
- 'ungefär' is an adverbial modifier of 'att betyda'.
- 'En' is an attributive modifier of 'person'.
- 'person' is the direct object of 'att betyda' and the subject of the relative clause 'som...'.
- 'som' is a subordinating conjunction introducing the relative clause.
- 'arbetar' is the predicate of the relative clause and has a coordinate relation with 'sover' and 'lever'.
- 'och' is a coordinating conjunction between 'arbetar' and 'sover' and between 'sover' and 'lever'.
- 'sover' and 'lever' are the other predicates of the coordinate clause.
- 'med' is a preposition introducing the prepositional phrase 'med datorer' which is the modifier of 'arbetar', 'sover', and 'lever'.
- 'datorer' is the direct object of the prepositional phrase 'med datorer'.
- The quotation mark is not useful for understanding dependencies and may be removed in further operations.

Here is the output of the dependency tree:

[(1, Då, 2), 
 (2, ändrade, 0), 
 (3, ordet, 2), 
 (4, hacker, 3), 
 (5, mening, 2), 
 (6, till, 8), 
 (7, att, 8), 
 (8, betyda, 5), 
 (9, ungefär, 8), 
 (10, En, 11), 
 (11, person, 8), 
 (12, som, 13), 
 (13, arbetar, 12), 
 (14, och, 13), 
 (15, sover, 14), 
 (16, och, 15), 
 (17, lever, 16), 
 (18, med, 17), 
 (19, datorer, 18), 
 (20, ., 0)]

Note: Dependency trees are usually developed by linguists using different theoretical grammar frameworks and the dependency structure of sentences is something about which linguists disagree. This output will give one of many possible interpretations of this sentence.
