To create a dependency tree for the given Swedish sentence, we need to parse the sentence and identify the relationships between the tokens. Here's the analysis:

1. "Viruset" is the subject of the sentence.
2. "aktiveras" is the main verb of the sentence, and it takes "Viruset" as its subject.
3. "då" is a subordinating conjunction introducing the dependent clause.
4. "användaren" is the subject of the dependent clause.
5. "kör" is the main verb of the dependent clause, taking "användaren" as its subject.
6. "det" is a direct object of "kör".
7. "program" is an indirect object of "kör", and it's modified by "som" (indirect object complement).
8. "som" is a subordinating conjunction introducing the dependent clause.
9. "viruset" is the subject of the dependent clause.
10. "infekterat" is the main verb of the dependent clause, taking "viruset" as its subject.

Here's the dependency tree:

[(1, Virus, 2), 
 (2, aktiveras, 0), 
 (3, då, 5), 
 (4, användaren, 5), 
 (5, kör, 2), 
 (6, det, 5), 
 (7, program, 9), 
 (8, som, 9), 
 (9, viruset, 8), 
 (10, infekterat, 7)]

This shows that:

- "Viruset" is the subject of "aktiveras".
- "aktiveras" is the main verb of the sentence (root).
- "då" is a subordinating conjunction introducing the dependent clause "användaren kör det program ...".
- "användaren" is the subject of "kör".
- "kör" is the main verb of the dependent clause and depends on "aktiveras".
- "det" is a direct object of "kör".
- "program" is an indirect object of "kör" and depends on "infekterat".
- "som" is a subordinating conjunction introducing the dependent clause "viruset infekterat".
- "viruset" is the subject of "infekterat" and depends on "som".
- "infekterat" is the main verb of the dependent clause, depending on "som" and "program" indirectly.

However, because of the rules of the given example, this output is most likely intended to not fully describe the overall structure of the sentence, but rather each individual word and its dependents in a simpler manner: 

[(1, Virus, 2), 
 (2, aktiveras, 0), 
 (3, då, 5), 
 (4, användaren, 5), 
 (5, kör, 2), 
 (6, det, 5), 
 (7, program, 8), 
 (8, som, 9), 
 (9, viruset, 10), 
 (10, infekterat, 7)]

 Here all numbers reference the individual token numbers, because Viruset, and "kör", and 'aktivereas, "infekterat",  may reference other unseen tokens as their Head.
