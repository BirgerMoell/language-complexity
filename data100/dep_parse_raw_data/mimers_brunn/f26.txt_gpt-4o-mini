To analyze the Swedish sentence "Man hyllar att F." and produce the dependency tree, we break down the sentence into its components:

1. "Man" (subject)
2. "hyllar" (verb)
3. "att" (subordinating conjunction)
4. "F." (a noun phrase/subject of the verb after "att", and a punctuation mark)

The parsing yields the following dependencies:

- "Man" is the subject of "hyllar" (index 2).
- "hyllar" is the main verb, hence its head is 0 (it has no parent).
- "att" is a complement taking "hyllar" as its head (index 2).
- "F." is the object of "att" (index 3), and since it's a punctuation mark, it is its own token but will point to "att".

The resulting dependency tree is:

```plaintext
[
    (1, Man, 2), 
    (2, hyllar, 0), 
    (3, att, 2), 
    (4, F., 3)
]
``` 

Here, each tuple represents a token's index, the token itself, and its head's index.
