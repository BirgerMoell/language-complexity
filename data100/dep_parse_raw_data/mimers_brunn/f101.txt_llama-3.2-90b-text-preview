To analyze the given Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we can use a dependency grammar framework. Based on the sentence structure and the relationships between the tokens, the following dependency tree is generated:

[(1, Delarna, 2), 
 (2, sätter, 0), 
 (3, man, 2), 
 (4, in, 2), 
 (5, i, 2), 
 (6, så, 8), 
 (7, kallade, 8), 
 (8, I/O-portar, 2), 
 (9, In/Out-portar, 8), 
 (10, ), 8), 
 (11, och, 13), 
 (12, desto, 14), 
 (13, fler, 14), 
 (14, sådana, 11), 
 (15, man, 11), 
 (16, har, 14), 
 (17, desto, 19), 
 (18, fler, 19), 
 (19, grafikkort, 11), 
 (20, och, 19), 
 (21, ljudkort, 20), 
 (22, m., 21)]

Here's a breakdown of the dependency relationships:

- 'Delarna' is a subject of 'sätter', represented as (1, Delarna, 2).
- 'sätter' is the root of the sentence, as indicated by the head index '0' in (2, sätter, 0).
- 'man', 'in', and 'i' are objects or arguments of 'sätter', as shown in (3, man, 2), (4, in, 2), and (5, i, 2).
- 'så kallade I/O-portar' is a prepositional phrase modifying 'i' with 'så' and 'kallade' as modifiers, shown in (6, så, 8), (7, kallade, 8), and (8, I/O-portar, 2). 'In/Out-portar' is a non-essential appositive that modifies 'I/O-portar', as represented in (9, In/Out-portar, 8).
- The left parenthesis is attached to 'I/O-portar' and the right parenthesis is also attached to 'I/O-portar', as shown in (8, I/O-portar, 2) and (10, ), 8).
- The second part of the sentence begins with 'och', which connects the coordinates 'fler sådana' and 'desto fler grafikkort och ljudkort'. 'desto fler' is a correlative construction, where 'desto' is a modifier of 'fler', as represented in (12, desto, 14) and (13, fler, 14). The subjects 'sådana man har' are related to 'fler' through the dependency (14, sådana, 11) and the verb 'har' is shown in (16, har, 14).
- 'desto fler grafikkort' and 'ljudkort' have a similar correlative construction, with 'desto' modifying 'fler', as shown in (17, desto, 19) and (18, fler, 19).
- The coordinates 'grafikkort' and 'ljudkort' are connected by 'och', as represented in (20, och, 19) and (21, ljudkort, 20).
- The abbreviation mark 'm.' is attached to 'ljudkort', as shown in (22, m., 21).
