The given sentence is a complex sentence, and its analysis can be broken down into several sub-sentences or clauses. Here is the output in the requested format:

[(1, Under, 2), 
(2, kolonialstyrelsen:, 4), 
(3, Som, 4), 
(4, sagt, 0), 
(5, så, 4), 
(6, erövrade, 4), 
(7, Portugal, 6), 
(8, Brasilien, 6), 
(9, på, 10), 
(10, 1500-talet, 6), 
(11, men, 13), 
(12, inte, 13), 
(13, förrän, 6), 
(14, år, 16), 
(15, 1530, 16), 
(16, så, 6), 
(17, började, 6), 
(18, man, 17), 
(19, vissa, 17), 
(20, något, 21), 
(21, intresse, 17), 
(22, för, 23), 
(23, sin, 24), 
(24, koloni., 17)]

This is a simplified dependency tree, assuming the following labels:
- (2, 4) means "kolonialstyrelsen: is a dependent (punctuation modifier) to the main sentence".
- (7, 6) means "Portugal is the agent (subject) of the verb 'erövrade'".
- (8, 6) means "Brasilien is the direct object of the verb 'erövrade'".
- (12, 13) means "inte is a negation of 'förrän'".
- (19, 17) means "vissa is a complement to the verb 'började'".
- (22, 23) means "för is a preposition introducing the dependent 'sin koloni'" etymologically.
However, please note that this tree analysis is simplified and doesn't represent the full subtlety of human relationship to the subject matter in terms, various degrees, and modes considered.

For deeper and better analysis, consider these alternative labels and roles:
- Head for each phrase.
- Dependent of each word (whether a subject, an object, an adjective, an adverb, or any other function that might contribute to a deeper understanding of its connections in the phrase).

Nonetheless, the overall logic that might lead to deeper understanding of content through syntax visualization needs expansion such that one includes this subtlety on various levels from individual word senses all the way up through phrase.
