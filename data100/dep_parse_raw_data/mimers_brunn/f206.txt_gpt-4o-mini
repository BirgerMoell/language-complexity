To analyze the given Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we can break down the sentence into its components and establish the relationships between them. Here is the output in the specified format:

```
[
    (1, Frihandeln, 2),
    (2, var, 0),
    (3, till, 4),
    (4, en, 5),
    (5, början, 3),
    (6, mycket, 5),
    (7, gynnsam, 2),
    (8, för, 9),
    (9, Storbritannien, 7),
    (10, ,, 2),
    (11, men, 12),
    (12, med, 14),
    (13, det, 14),
    (14, övriga, 15),
    (15, Europas, 14),
    (16, snabba, 15),
    (17, industrialisering, 16),
    (18, ökade, 2),
    (19, konkurrensen, 18),
    (20, både, 21),
    (21, om, 22),
    (22, råvarorna, 21),
    (23, och, 24),
    (24, de, 25),
    (25, nya, 26),
    (26, industriprodukterna, 18),
    (27, ., 2)
]
```

In this output:
- Each tuple represents a token in the sentence.
- The first element is the index of the token.
- The second element is the token itself.
- The third element is the index of the head token (a value of 0 indicates that the token is the root of the sentence).
