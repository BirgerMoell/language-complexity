To create a dependency tree for the given sentence, we'll need to tokenize the sentence and then identify the grammatical dependencies between the tokens. Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. Tokenize the sentence:
   - Fördelar (0)
   - & (1)
   - nackdelarUSB (2)  (assumed as a compound word)
   - - (3)
   - fördelar (4)
   - Implementerad (5)
   - standard (6)
   - i (7)
   - PC (8)
   - och (9)
   - som (10)
   - har (11)
   - stort (12)
   - operativssystemsstöd (13)
   - , (14)
   - i (15)
   - t. (16)

2. Identify the grammatical dependencies:
   - The sentence can be divided into two main parts: the introduction ("Fördelar & nackdelarUSB - fördelar") and the explanation ("Implementerad standard...").
   - The introduction is a compound noun phrase with "Fördelar" and "nackdelarUSB - fördelar" as its components.
   - The explanation can be further divided into two clauses: "Implementerad standard i PC" and "som har stort operativssystemsstöd".
   - In the first clause, "Implementerad" is an adjective modifying "standard", "i" is a preposition, and "PC" is the object of "i".
   - In the second clause, "som" is a relative pronoun referring to "standard i PC", "har" is the main verb, and "stort" is an adjective modifying "operativssystemsstöd".

Based on this analysis, the dependency tree can be constructed as follows:

- (0, Fördelar, 2)
- (1, &, 2)
- (2, nackdelarUSB, 4)
- (3, -, 4)
- (4, fördelar, 0)
- (5, Implementerad, 6)
- (6, standard, 11)
- (7, i, 8)
- (8, PC, 10)
- (9, och, 10)
- (10, som, 6)
- (11, har, 6)
- (12, stort, 13)
- (13, operativssystemsstöd, 11)
- (14, , , 16)
- (15, i, 15)  (i is not directly connected to the root - need subordinating conjunction or similar
- (16, t., 0)

Here's a rough hierarchy based on this output (please note the direct connections above may not be fully correct, and final model analysis should consider also subtrees and meaning/sufficient inclusion for connecting phrase or interdependent fragments:
