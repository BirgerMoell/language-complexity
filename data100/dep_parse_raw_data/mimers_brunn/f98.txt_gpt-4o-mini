    (3, att, 2),
    (4, detta, 5),
    (5, skall, 2),

    (7, datorföretagen, 6),
    (8, så, 9),
    (9, att, 6),
    (10, de, 11),
    (11, börjar, 9),
    (12, använda, 11),
    (13, något, 14),
    (14, annat, 12),
    (15, , , 14),  // No actual token here, would represent the comma
    (16, miljövänligare, 17),
    (17, sätt, 12),
    (18, att, 17),
    (19, flammskydda, 18),
    (20, sina, 21),
    (21, monitorer, 19)
]
```

Note: The above output is constructed with the assumption of a generic token index and correct parsing following dependency rules. The placeholder for the comma is indicated as an empty entry with the appropriate connections. In actual tokenization, the token entries would remain continuous without breaks based on grammar structure.
