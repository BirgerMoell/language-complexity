Here's the dependency tree for the given sentence:
[(1, Det, 2), (2, är, 0), (3, med, 4), (4, sina, 6), (5, 1, 7), (6, 246, 7), (7, 700, 8), (8, km², 4), (9, 2,7, 11), (10, gånger, 11), (11, så, 12), (12, stort, 11), (13, som, 14), (14, Sverige, 17), (15, men, 17), (16, det, 17), (17, skiljer, 0), (18, ändå, 19), (19, bara, 20), (20, 6,5, 22), (21, miljoner, 20), (22, i, 24), (23, befolkning, 22), (24, vilket, 26), (25, betyder, 27), (26, att, 27), (27, befolkningstätheten, 28), (28, per, 30), (29, km², 30), (30, är, 28), (31, 12,4, 33), (32, i, 34), (33, Angola, 35), (34, medan, 36), (35, Sverige, 36), (36, ligger, 0), (37, på, 38), (38, 21,9, 36), (39, ., 0)]

Here's a brief explanation of each relation:

- "(1, Det, 2)" indicates that "Det" (it) is the subject of "är" (is).
- "(2, är, 0)" indicates that "är" is the main verb of the sentence.
- "(3, med, 4)", "(4, sina, 6)", and "(5, 1, 7)", etc. form the subject's attribute phrase.
- "(9, 2,7, 11)" indicates that "2,7 gånger" (2.7 times) is the object of the sentence.
- "(13, som, 14)" indicates that "som" (than) is a conjunction introducing a comparison with "Sverige" (Sweden).
- "(15, men, 17)", "(16, det, 17)" indicates that "men" (but) begins a new, contrasting clause with "det" as its subject.
- "(18, ändå, 19)", "(19, bara, 20)" forms the adverbial phrase "ändå bara" (only).
- "(20, 6,5, 22)" and "(21, miljoner, 20)" form the direct object of the clause.
- "(23, befolkning, 22)" is in apposition with "miljoner" (millions), describing the subject of the comparison.
- "(25, betyder, 27)" indicates that "betyder" (means) is the main verb of the new clause.
- "(28, per, 30)" and "(29, km², 30)" form a phrase describing the "befolkningstäthet" (population density).
- "(32, i, 34)" and "(33, Angola, 35)" describe the location where the population density is "12,4" (12.4).
- "(35, medan, 36)" introduces the contrasting clause.
- "(38, 21,9, 36)" is the direct object of the final clause.
- "(39, ., 0)" suggests the period marks the end of the sentence.

This would typically be visualized in a tree structure where each parent-child relation shows a dependent token connected to its governing token. Some dependencies are based on Swedish grammar rules and might require context to be ambiguous.
