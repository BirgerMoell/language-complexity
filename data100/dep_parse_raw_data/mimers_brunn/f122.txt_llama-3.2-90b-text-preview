To analyze the sentence, we will first break it down into tokens and assign an index to each token. The sentence is: 

"Barnfamiljer som vistats i Sverige i minst 4 år som sökande, anses ha skäl på grund av vistelsetiden."

The tokens are:

1. Barnfamiljer
2. som
3. vistats
4. i
5. Sverige
6. i
7. minst
8. 4
9. år
10. som
11. sökande
12. ,
13. anses
14. ha
15. skäl
16. på
17. grund
18. av
19. vistelsetiden
20. .

The dependency tree can be analyzed as follows:

- "Barnfamiljer" is the subject of the sentence, and its head is "anses" (index 13).
- "så som" (indexes 2 and 10) are subordinating conjunctions and their head is "vistats" (index 3) and "sökande" (index 11) respectively.
- "vistats" is a verb in the relative clause, and its head is "anses" (index 13) through the relative pronoun "som" (index 2).
- "i Sverige", "i", "minst", "4", "år" are modifiers of "vistats" and their heads are "vistats" (index 3).
- "sökande" is an appositive of "Barnfamiljer" and its head is also "anses" (index 13).
- "-" (index 12) is a punctuation mark and its head is "sökande" (index 11).
- "anses" is the main verb and its head is the root of the tree (index 0).
- "ha" is an auxiliary verb and its head is "anses" (index 13).
- "skäl" is an object of the verb "ha" and its head is "ha" (index 14).
- "på grund av vistelsetiden" is a prepositional phrase and its head is "skäl" (index 15).

Therefore, the final dependency tree is:

[(1, Barnfamiljer, 13), (2, som, 3), (3, vistats, 13), (4, i, 3), (5, Sverige, 3), (6, i, 8), (7, minst, 8), (8, 4, 9), (9, år, 3), (10, som, 11), (11, sökande, 13), (12, ",", 11), (13, anses, 0), (14, ha, 13), (15, skäl, 14), (16, på, 19), (17, grund, 19), (18, av, 19), (19, vistelsetiden, 15), (20, ., 19)]
