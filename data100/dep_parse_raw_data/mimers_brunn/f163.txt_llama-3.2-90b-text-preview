Based on the provided Swedish sentence, the dependency tree can be analyzed as follows:

1. The sentence starts with "Till", which is a preposition indicating direction or movement. It has a dependent "Sverige", which is the location to which the action is directed.
2. "kom" is the main verb, indicating the action of arrival. It is the root of the sentence.
3. "sporten/hobbyn" is the subject of the sentence, which is the thing that arrived. The slash between "sporten" and "hobbyn" can be treated as an implicit conjunction, but for simplicity, it will be treated as a single token "sporten/hobbyn" with a head "kom".
4. "under" is a preposition indicating time or circumstance. It has a dependent "1700-talet", which is the time period during which the action occurred.
5. "och" is a conjunction connecting two clauses.
6. "blev" is a main verb indicating a change in state. It has a dependent "efer ett tag", which is an adverbial phrase indicating time.
7. "ett" is an indefinite article preceding a noun.
8. "tag" is a noun, the object of the preposition "eftet", which in turn is dependent on "blev".
9. "en" is an indefinite article preceding a noun.
10. "populär" is an adjective modifying the noun "söndagshobby".
11. "söndagshobby" is the noun, the state that "sporten/hobbyn" becomes.

The dependency tree can be represented as:

[(1, Till, 2), 
(2, Sverige, 1), 
(3, kom, 0), 
(4, sporten/hobbyn, 3), 
(5, under, 6), 
(6, 1700-talet, 5), 
(7, och, 8), 
(8, blev, 3), 
(9, eftet, 10), 
(10, ett, 11), 
(11, tag, 8), 
(12, en, 13), 
(13, populär, 14), 
(14, söndagshobby, 8)]

However, some adjustments should be made:
- "under" should have "1700-talet" as its dependent, but it is also dependent on "kom". Therefore, "under" is not directly dependent on "1700-talet" but has an intermediate node, and it is actually dependent on "kom". 
- "en" in the phrase "en populär söndagshobby" should have "populär" as its head.
- It would be more accurate to represent the sentence structure if "blev" is connected to "och" instead of "kom".
- The actual dependency for "populär" is "söndagshobby".

The corrected dependency tree is:

[(1, Till, 2), 
(2, Sverige, 4), 
(3, kom, 0), 
(4, sporten/hobbyn, 3), 
(5, under, 3), 
(6, 1700-talet, 5), 
(7, och, 8), 
(8, blev, 7), 
(9, etter, 8), 
(10, ett, 11), 
(11, tag, 9), 
(12, en, 13), 
(13, populär, 14), 
(14, söndagshobby, 8)]
