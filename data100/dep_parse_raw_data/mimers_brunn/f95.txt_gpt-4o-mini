To analyze the given Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we will extract the tokens, identify their grammatical relationships, and determine the head for each token.

Here is the dependency tree output for the provided sentence:

```
[
    (1, Delarna, 2),
    (2, sätter, 0),
    (3, man, 2),
    (4, in, 2),
    (5, i, 6),
    (6, så, 7),
    (7, kallade, 8),
    (8, I/O-portar, 4),
    (9, (, 4),
    (10, In/Out-portar, 9),
    (11, ), 4),
    (12, och, 2),
    (13, desto, 14),
    (14, fler, 15),
    (15, sådana, 2),
    (16, man, 17),
    (17, har, 14),
    (18, ,, 17),
    (19, desto, 20),
    (20, fler, 21),
    (21, grafikkort, 22),
    (22, och, 23),
    (23, ljudkort, 22),
    (24, m, 0)
]
```

In this representation:
- Each tuple represents a token in the format (token index, token, index of the head token).
- The head tokens are represented based on their grammatical relationships in the sentence.
