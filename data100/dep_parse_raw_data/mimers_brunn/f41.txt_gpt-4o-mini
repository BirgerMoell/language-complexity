To analyze the provided Swedish sentence and produce the corresponding dependency tree, we'll break down the sentence into its tokens and determine the relationships between them. Here is the dependency tree representation of the given sentence:

```
[
    (1, Delarna, 2),
    (2, sätter, 0),
    (3, man, 2),
    (4, in, 2),
    (5, i, 6),
    (6, så, 7),
    (7, kallade, 8),
    (8, I/O-portar, 4),
    (9, (, 4),
    (10, In/Out-portar, 9),
    (11, ), 4),
    (12, och, 2),
    (13, desto, 14),
    (14, fler, 15),
    (15, sådana, 2),
    (16, man, 2),
    (17, har, 16),
    (18, desto, 19),
    (19, fler, 20),
    (20, grafikkort, 21),
    (21, och, 2),
    (22, ljudkort, 21),
    (23, m, 2)
]
```

In this representation, each token is associated with its index, the actual token itself, and the index of its head token, accurately reflecting the syntactical structure of the sentence.
