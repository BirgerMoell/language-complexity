The Swedish sentence 'Delarna sätter man in i så kallade I/O-portar (In/Out-portar), och desto fler sådana man har, desto fler grafikkort och ljudkort m.' is a bit long and complex. Here's a possible dependency tree for it:

[(1, Delarna, 2), 
(2, sätter, 0), 
(3, man, 2), 
(4, in, 2), 
(5, i, 6), 
(6, så, 8), 
(7, kallade, 8), 
(8, I/O-portar, 5), 
(9, (, 11), 
(10, In/Out-portar, 11), 
(11, ), 8), 
(12, och, 14), 
(13, desto, 14), 
(14, fler, 16), 
(15, sådana, 16), 
(16, man, 18), 
(17, har, 18), 
(18, desto, 20), 
(19, fler, 20), 
(20, grafikkort, 24), 
(21, och, 24), 
(22, ljudkort, 21), 
(23, m., 20)]

Here's how it works:

- 'sätter' is the main verb in the clause (2), which has 'Delarna' as subject (1), 'man' as indirect object (3), 'in' as adverbial (4), and the sub-clause 'i så kallade I/O-portar' as a prepositional object (8).
- The prepositional object contains the following items:
  * 'i' (5) is the preposition that leads into the phrase.
  * 'så' (6) is an adverb which in this context serves as a introductory word.
  * 'kallade' (7) serves as a modifier of the type described by the main word of the phrase.
  * 'I/O-portar' (8) is the main word in the phrase, to which the word 'In/Out-portar' in parentheses is a synonym or an alternative understanding of the term used.
- The sub-clause is separated with a comma from the next sub-clause 'desto fler sådana man har', which is connected to the first one by the coordinating conjunction 'och' (12).
- The two phrases 'desto fler sådana man'  and 'desto fler grafikkort och ljudkort m.' contain an ablatival absolute.
