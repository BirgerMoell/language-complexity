To analyze the given Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we need to break down the sentence into its constituent parts and establish the grammatical relationships between them.

Here's the analysis of the given sentence:

1. Den (Det) - 'Den' is a demonstrative pronoun meaning 'the'.
2. del (Huv) - 'del' is a noun meaning 'part'.
3. av (Prep) - 'av' is a preposition meaning 'of'.
4. koden (Obj) - 'koden' is a noun meaning 'the code'.
5. som (RelP) - 'som' is a relative pronoun meaning 'which'.
6. ger (Pred) - 'ger' is a verb meaning 'gives'.
7. order (Obj) - 'order' is a noun meaning 'instructions'.
8. om (Prep) - 'om' is a preposition meaning 'about'.
9. andra (Det) - 'andra' is a determiner meaning 'other'.
10. saker (Obj) - 'saker' is a noun meaning 'things'.
11. utöver (Adv) - 'utöver' is an adverb meaning 'in addition to'.
12. att (Inf) - 'att' is a subordinating conjunction introducing an infinitive clause.
13. sprida (Inf) - 'sprida' is a verb meaning 'to spread'.
14. och (Koord) - 'och' is a coordinating conjunction.
15. gömma (Inf) - 'gömma' is a verb meaning 'to hide'.
16. sig (Obj) - 'sig' is a reflexive pronoun.
17. kallas (Pred) - 'kallas' is a verb meaning 'is called'.
18. ”payload”, (Obj) - 'payload' is a noun (in quotes).
19. dvs (Part) - 'dvs' is an abbreviation for 'det vill säga', meaning 'that is'.
20. last (Obj) - 'last' is a noun meaning 'load'.
21. på (Prep) - 'på' is a preposition meaning 'in'.
22. svenska (Attr) - 'svenska' is an adjective meaning 'Swedish'.

Now, we can create the dependency tree:

[(1, Den, 2), (2, del, 0), (3, av, 4), (4, koden, 2), (5, som, 6), (6, ger, 5), (7, order, 6), (8, om, 10), (9, andra, 10), (10, saker, 7), (11, utöver, 13), (12, att, 13), (13, sprida, 11), (14, och, 15), (15, gömma, 14), (16, sig, 15), (17, kallas, 0), (18, payload, 17), (19, dvs, 20), (20, last, 18), (21, på, 22), (22, svenska, 20)]

However, this is not a fully correct dependency tree, since there are some aspects of the sentence that are tricky to parse and may require some assumptions. For example, the 'utöver' can be seen as modifying 'att sprida och gömma sig', but could also be seen as modifying 'ger order', depending on the exact meaning intended.

So, this is not the only possible dependency tree, and some degree of interpretation is necessary.
