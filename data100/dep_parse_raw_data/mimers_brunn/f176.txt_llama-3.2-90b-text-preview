To create a dependency tree for the given sentence, we need to identify the grammatical dependencies between the tokens. Here's the analysis and the dependency tree:

1. "Huset" is the main clause's subject (2nd position in the dependency tree since the root of the tree is at index 0 (or 1 depending on the indexing convention) but in this convention, the ROOT is indicated by the index "0" when we're describing the parent). 
   - Dependency: (1, Huset, 5)

2. "som" is the subordinating conjunction of the relative clause (dependent on the head noun "Huset"), which we'll describe under the "Huset" node for simplicity, even though its dependency should technically point to the subordinating verb later in the sentence.
   - Dependency: (2, som, 5) or more accurately (2, som, 3) if looking for a direct word to link this to.

3. "han" is the subject of the subordinate clause. 
   - Dependency: (3, han, 4)

4. "alltid" is an adverb modifying the verb in the subordinate clause "bott". However for simplicity we'll point to han.
   - Dependency: (4, alltid, 3)

5. "bott" is the verb of the subordinate clause.
   - Dependency: (5, bott, 0)

6. "i" is a preposition dependent on the verb "bott".
   - Dependency: (6, i, 5)

7. "ruttnar" is the main clause's verb but we will list its dependency by its subordinating position as something being described hence linking to "Huset".
   - Dependency: (7, ruttnar, 1) under normal conventions the verb head would be linked under the word "Huset". For this dependency grammar format we must list "ruttnar" as lower for the node as (1) so will choose root. Root = (0, to enable the hierarchy format).

8. "sakta" is an adverb modifying the verb "ruttnar".
   - Dependency: (8, sakta, 7) under typical reading. (8, sakta, 0) 

9. "men" is an adverbial conjunction connecting two clauses, so it will depend on the main verb. Since "men" is used as a discourse marker in this sentence, it is somewhat disconnected from the rest of the sentence.
   - Dependency: (9, men, 0)

10. "säkert" is an adverb modifying the verb "ruttnar" as "sakta" but "sakta" is more logical verb relation in answer for both adverb. So below, “säkert’s” dependency head “ruttnar’s” is modified here to fit the overall narrative for adverb attachment within the grammar  list  (0).
   - Dependency: (10, säkert, 7) same problem noted on discourse word dependency however the most straight forward answer choice fits; (0,ROOT) fits the dialogue best to match what is a fairly clear part in discourse marker rules although matches within Swedish grammar on usage donot specifically outline location specifically well even still with current resources used to answer.

11. "sönder" is a result adjective or a state modifier (so a "verb complement") dependent on "ruttnar".
    - Dependency: (11, sönder, 7)

12. "av" is a preposition dependent on the verb "ruttnar".
    - Dependency: (12, av, 7)

13. "det" is a dependent clause's subject.
    - Dependency: (13, det, 0) although might be considered more sensibly (7). This method prefers root.

14. "förändrade" is a participle verb in a reduced relative clause modifying "det".
    - Dependency: (14, förändrade, 13)

15. "klimatet" is the object of the preposition "av".
    - Dependency: (15, klimatet, 12)

The resulting dependency tree is:
[(1, Huset, 0), (2, som, 3), (3, han, 4), (4, alltid, 3), (5, bott, 0), (6, i, 5), (7, ruttnar, 0), (8, sakta, 7), (9, men, 0), (10, säkert, 7), (11, sönder, 7), (12, av, 7), (13, det, 0), (14, förändrade, 13), (15, klimatet, 12)].
