To analyze the given Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we need to break down the sentence into its component parts and identify the grammatical relationships between them.

Here's the sentence tokenized:

1. Den
2. del
3. av
4. koden
5. som
6. ger
7. order
8. om
9. andra
10. saker
11. utöver
12. att
13. sprida
14. och
15. gömma
16. sig
17. kallas
18. ”
19. payload
20. ”
21. dvs
22. last
23. på
24. svenska
25. .
