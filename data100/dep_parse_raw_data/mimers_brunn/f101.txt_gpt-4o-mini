5. i (in) - preposition that introduces the complement.
6. så (so) - adverb modifying "kallade."
7. kallade (called) - an adjective modifying "I/O-portar."
8. I/O-portar (I/O ports) - object of the preposition.

10. , (comma) - punctuation marking a pause.
11. och (and) - conjunction linking two clauses.
