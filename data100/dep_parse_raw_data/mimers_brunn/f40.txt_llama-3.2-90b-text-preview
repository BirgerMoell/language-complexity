To analyze the given Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we'll break down the sentence into individual tokens and assign a head token to each token based on their grammatical relationship.

Here's the breakdown of the sentence:

1. Sedan (adverb)
2. försökte (verb)
3. jag (pronoun)
4. sammanställa (verb, infinitive)
5. det (pronoun)
6. till (preposition)
7. en (determiner)
8. relativt (adverb)
9. kort (adjective)
10. text (noun)
11. . (punctuation mark)

Now, let's create the dependency tree based on the grammatical relationships between these tokens:

- Sedan is an adverb that modifies the verb "försökte". So, its head token is "försökte" (index 2).
- försökte is the main verb and the root of the tree. So, its head token is 0 (the root).
- jag is the subject of the sentence and has a nominative case, which makes "försökte" its head token.
- sammanställa is the infinitive verb that depends on "försökte" as its head.
- det is the direct object of "sammanställa" and depends on "text" via the preposition "till". However, since Swedish has a Subject-Verb-Object-Adverb word order, the dependency might be incorrect in this case, making "sammanställa" the head. I have decided to choose sammanställa in this instance.
- till is a preposition that is usually considered to depend on its complement "en relativt kort text".
- en is a determiner that depends on the noun "text".
- relativt is an adverb that modifies the adjective "kort" and thus depends on it, although it can be considered to depend on "text" (kort's head) directly. 
- Since the attribute appears on the left-hand side of the head, the adverb 'relativt' depends on 'kort'.
- kort is an adjective that depends on the noun "text" as its head.
- text is a noun and is the direct object of the sentence, and thus depends on the main verb "försökte" which is influenced by the verb sammanställa. For the purposes of this exercise though it is sufficient to say text is influenced by 'sammanställa'.
- The punctuation mark . depends on the main verb of the sentence, "försökte" (represented as 2, which is the head "försökte" in this dependency graph).

The resulting dependency tree can be represented as:
[(1, Sedan, 2), (2, försökte, 0), (3, jag, 2), (4, sammanställa, 2), (5, det, 4), (6, till, 10), (8, relativt, 9), (9, kort, 10), (10, text, 4), (7, en, 10), (11, ., 2)].
