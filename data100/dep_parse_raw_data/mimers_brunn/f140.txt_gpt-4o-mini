To analyze the given Swedish sentence "Vid midnatten blir allt klart med valet och sedan rapporterar man hur valresultatet ser ut." and produce a dependency tree, we can break down the sentence and determine the relationships between the words.

Here's the resulting dependency tree:

1. [(1, Vid, 2), (2, midnatten, 3), (3, blir, 0), (4, allt, 5), (5, klart, 3), (6, med, 7), (7, valet, 3), (8, och, 9), (9, sedan, 10), (10, rapporterar, 3), (11, man, 10), (12, hur, 13), (13, valresultatet, 10), (14, ser, 13), (15, ut, 14), (16, ., 3)]

In this representation:
- Each tuple `(index, token, head_index)` indicates the token's index, its text, and the index of its head token (0 indicates the root of the sentence). The tokens are separated by their grammatical relations.
