To create a dependency tree for the given Swedish sentence, we'll break down the sentence into individual tokens and identify their grammatical relationships. 

The given sentence: "Kolhydrater behövs främst för att ge energi och finns i livsmedel från växtriket."

Here are the individual tokens:

1. Kolhydrater
2. behövs
3. främst
4. för
5. att
6. ge
7. energi
8. och
9. finns
10. i
11. livsmedel
12. från
13. växtriket
14. .

Now, we'll create the dependency tree by identifying the grammatical relationships between the tokens. Here is one possible dependency tree for the sentence:

[(1, Kolhydrater, 5), (2, behövs, 0), (3, främst, 2), (4, för, 6), (5, att, 2), (6, ge, 5), (7, energi, 6), (8, och, 9), (9, finns, 2), (10, i, 11), (11, livsmedel, 9), (12, från, 13), (13, växtriket, 11), (14, ., 9)]

Here's a breakdown of the relationships in the dependency tree:

* "Kolhydrater" is the subject of the sentence and depends on the main clause "att ge energi" (index 5), but since we can't have two main clauses, we have instead set it to depend on index 5 for the "att" clause and for "att ge energi". It would be optimal to make this sentence 2 independent sentences though.
* "behövs" is the root of the sentence.
* "främst" is an adverb that modifies the verb "behövs" (index 2).
* "för att ge energi" is an infinitive phrase that functions as an adverbial modifier of the verb "behövs". 
* "ge" is an infinitive verb that depends on the conjunction "att" (index 5).
* "energi" is the direct object of the verb "ge".
* "och" is a conjunction that connects the clauses "behövs" and "finns".
* "finns" is the root of the second clause.
* "i livsmedel från växtriket" is a prepositional phrase that functions as an adverbial modifier of the verb "finns".
* "livsmedel" is the object of the preposition "i".
* "från växtriket" is a prepositional phrase that functions as an adverbial modifier of the noun "livsmedel".
* "." is a punctuation mark that denotes the end of the sentence.

Note that this is one possible dependency tree for the sentence, and different grammatical analyses may yield different results.
