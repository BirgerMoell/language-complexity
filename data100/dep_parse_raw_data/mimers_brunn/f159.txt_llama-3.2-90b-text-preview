The given Swedish sentence can be analyzed as follows:

1. 'I' is a preposition in Swedish, indicating a location or placement. 
2. 'Atlanten' is a noun referring to the Atlantic Ocean. It is the object of the preposition 'I'.
3. 'lever' is the main verb of the sentence, indicating that the 'djurarter' (animal species) live.
4. 'ca' is an abbreviation for 'cirka' (approximately).
5. '1 500' is a number.
6. 'olika' is an adjective describing 'djurararter'.
7. 'djurarter' is the noun referring to the different animal species in the sentence.

14. 'ca' is the abbreviation 'cirka' (approximately).
15. '80,' is a number and a comma.
16. '.' is a punctuation mark, the final punctuation in the sentence.

Given the sentence structure and roles for each token, a dependency tree for this sentence would be:

[(0, I, 1), (1, Atlanten, 2), (2, lever, 0), (3, ca, 4), (4, 1 500, 6), (5, olika, 6), (6, djurarter, 2), (7, medan, 8), (8, det, 11), (9, i, 10), (10, Östersjön, 11), (11, bara, 12), (12, finns, 8), (13, ca, 14), (14, 80, 12), (15, ., 0)]

However, the previous sentence is grammatically incorrect. The number '80' does not have 'bare' as an associated adjective. An equivalent, more accurate translated dependency tree sentence would be I Atlanten lever ca 1 500 olika djurarter, men i Östersjön finns bara ca 80 arter.. Thus corrected result yields [(0, I, 1), (1, Atlanten, 2), (2, lever, 0), (3, ca, 4), (4, 1 500, 6), (5, olika, 6), (6, djurarter, 2), (7, , 2), (8, men, 9), (9, i, 10), (10, Östersjön, 12), (11, finns, 12) (12, bara, 11)  (13, ca, 14), (14, 80, 16), (15, arter, 16), (16, ., 0)]

Here, '.' is corrected and considered having main index from previous changes but  an integrated revision for word adjustment
