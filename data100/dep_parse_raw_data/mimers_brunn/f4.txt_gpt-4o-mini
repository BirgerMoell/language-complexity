To analyze the provided Swedish sentence and generate a dependency tree, we first identify the tokens, their relationships, and the structure of the sentence. Here is the output based on the given sentence:

```
[
    (1, Hans, 2), 
    (2, utseende, 0), 
    (3, är, 2), 
    (4, ungefär, 3), 
    (5, lika, 3), 
    (6, lugubert, 5), 
    (7, som, 6), 
    (8, hans, 9), 
    (9, uppförande, 7), 
    (10, stor, 9), 
    (11, och, 10), 
    (12, kraftig, 10), 
    (13, med, 14), 
    (14, grov, 15), 
    (15, svart, 14), 
    (16, hårväxt, 13), 
    (17, och, 2), 
    (18, ett, 19), 
    (19, nästintill, 20), 
    (20, demolerat, 21), 
    (21, ansikte, 17), 
    (22, ., 2)
]
```

In this tree:
- Each token is indexed.
- The head of each token is designated by its index, which identifies the syntactic relationship between the tokens.
- The root of the sentence is represented by a head index of 0.
