The provided sentence appears to be slightly ungrammatical, but I'll do my best to create a dependency tree from it. Here's the analysis:

1. "Plankalkül" is a noun and the head of the sentence.
2. "hette" is a verb, which is the main action of the sentence, and it depends on "Plankalkül".
3. "den" is a definite article that depends on "första datorns".
4. "första datorns" is a noun phrase that depends on "som".
5. "som" is a subordinating conjunction that depends on "hette".
6. "gjorde" is a verb that depends on "som" and indicates the action of "datorns".
7. "i" is a preposition that depends on "gjorde".
8. "Tyskland" is a noun that depends on "i".
9. "den" is a definite article that depends on "används".
10. "används" is a verb that depends on "som" and is the main action of the subordinate clause.
11. "för" is a preposition that depends on "används".
12. "inom" is a preposition that depends on "används" (this might be a doubled preposition, which is not typical in Swedish, so it could be analyzed differently).
13. "millitäten" is a noun that likely contains a spelling error and should be "militären" (nominative form would be more suitable), depending on "inom".

The corrected sentence should be:

Plankalkül hette den första datorn som gjorde i Tyskland och som den används för inom militären.

Given the provided sentence, here's the dependency tree:
[(1, Plankalkül, 2), 
(2, hette, 0), 
(3, den, 4), 
(4, första datorns, 5), 
(5, datorns, 6), 
(6, som, 2), 
(7, gjorde, 6), 
(8, i, 7), 
(9, Tyskland, 8), 
(10, den, 11), 
(11, används, 6), 
(12, för, 11), 
(13, inom, 12), 
(14, millitäten, 13)]

Note that this analysis is based on an attempt to understand the intended meaning of the sentence, and it should be taken as an approximation. The sentence appears to have errors and it is not clear if the grammatical structure is intended to be complex or if it's just due to errors.
