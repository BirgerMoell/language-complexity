To create a dependency tree for the provided Swedish sentence, we first need to tokenize the sentence and identify the grammatical relationships between each token. Here is the resulting dependency tree:

```
[
    (1, De, 2), 
    (2, storlekar, 0), 
    (3, som, 4), 
    (4, finns, 2), 
    (5, är, 2), 
    (6, 15", 5), 
    (7, 17", 5), 
    (8, 19", 5), 
    (9, och, 5), 
    (10, 21", 5), 
    (11, på, 5), 
    (12, de, 13), 
    (13, vanliga, 14), 
    (14, skärmarna12", 11), 
    (15, 15", 5), 
    (16, 17", 5), 
    (17, och, 5),
    (18, 18", 5), 
    (19, på, 5), 
    (20, de, 21), 
    (21, platta, 22), 
    (22, skärmarna, 19), 
    (23, ., 0)
]
```

This output reflects the structure of the sentence, where each token's index is paired with its head token's index, establishing the relationships between the words.
