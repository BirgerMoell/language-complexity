To produce a dependency tree for the given Swedish sentence, we break down the sentence into tokens and establish the head relationships based on the grammatical structure. Here’s the dependency tree for the provided sentence:

```
[(1, Han, 2), 
 (2, hade, 0), 
 (3, lovat, 2), 
 (4, att, 3), 
 (5, föra, 4), 
 (6, med, 5), 
 (7, sig, 6), 
 (8, guld, 5), 
 (9, tillbaka, 8), 
 (10, till, 5), 
 (11, kungaparet, 10), 
 (12, och, 2), 
 (13, därför, 12), 
 (14, blev, 12), 
 (15, det, 14), 
 (16, en, 17), 
 (17, besvikelse, 14), 
 (18, när, 14), 
 (19, han, 18), 
 (20, möttes, 19), 
 (21, av, 20), 
 (22, fattigdom, 21)]
```

In this output:
- Each token is assigned an index.
- The head relationship is established based on syntactic dependencies. 'hade' is the main verb and thus has index `0` (the root).
- Punctuation marks, conjunctions, and other connectors are accounted for as necessary tokens.
