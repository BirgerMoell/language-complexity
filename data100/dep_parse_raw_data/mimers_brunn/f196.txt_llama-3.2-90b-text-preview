To analyze the sentence and produce a dependency tree, we need to parse the sentence into its constituent parts and determine the grammatical relationships between them. Here is one possible dependency tree for the sentence:

[(1, Under, 2), (2, kolonialstyrelsen, 11), (3, :, 2), (4, Som, 5), (5, sagt, 6), (6, så, 5), (7, erövrade, 11), (8, Portugal, 7), (9, Brasilien, 7), (10, på, 7), (11, 1500-talet, 7), (12, men, 13), (13, inte, 14), (14, förrän, 14), (15, år, 17), (16, 1530, 15), (17, så, 18), (18, började, 20), (19, man, 18), (20, vissa, 18), (21, något, 22), (22, intresse, 20), (23, för, 25), (24, sin, 25), (25, koloni, 20), (26, ., 0)]

However, some of the relationships could be rearranged depending on the chosen grammar and level of detail.

In this tree:

- 'Under' is an adverbial modifier of 'kolonialstyrelsen', both of which are in a sentence-initial adverbial phrase.
- 'Som sagt' is a fixed phrase that functions as an adverbial modifier of 'så'.
- 'Erövrade' is the main verb of the sentence, with 'Portugal', 'Brasilien', and the adverbial phrases 'på 1500-talet' and 'förrän år 1530' as its dependents.
- 'men' is a coordinating conjunction that connects the two clauses of the sentence.
- 'Inte förrän' is an adverbial phrase that functions as a modifier of 'år 1530', which itself is an adverbial modifier of 'så'.
- 'Började' is the main verb of the second clause, with 'man' as its subject and 'vissa något intresse för sin koloni' as its object.
- 'Vissa' is a dependent of 'började', while 'något intresse' is an object of 'vissa'.
- 'Intresse' has 'något' as a modifier, and 'för sin koloni' as a prepositional complement. 

Note that punctuation, such as the full stop at the end of the sentence, does not have a clear semantic role, so it is shown as a dependent of the root of the sentence.
