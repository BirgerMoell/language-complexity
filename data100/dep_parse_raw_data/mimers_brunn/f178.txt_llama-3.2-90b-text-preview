To create the dependency tree for the given sentence, we can break it down into its individual components and their relationships. Here's the analysis and resulting dependency tree:

The sentence can be tokenized as follows:

- Polyperna (1)
- blir (2)
- färgglada (3)
- och (4)
- får (5)
- genom (6)
- fotosyntes (7)
- ca (8)
- 90 (9)
- % (10)
- energi (11)
- , (12)
- tack (13)
- vare (14)
- den (15)
- grönalg (16)
- , (17)
- zooxanthell (18)
- , (19)
- som (20)
- finns (21)
- inne (22)
- i (23)
- varje (24)
- polyp (25)
- . (26)

Here's the dependency tree:

[(1, Polyperna, 2), 
 (2, blir, 0), 
 (3, färgglada, 2), 
 (4, och, 5), 
 (5, får, 2), 
 (6, genom, 7), 
 (7, fotosyntes, 5), 
 (8, ca, 9), 
 (9, 90, 10), 
 (10, %, 11), 
 (11, energi, 5), 
 (12, ,, 11), 
 (13, tack, 15), 
 (14, vare, 13), 
 (15, den, 16), 
 (16, grönalg, 18), 
 (17, ,, 18), 
 (18, zooxanthell, 20), 
 (19, ,, 20), 
 (20, som, 21), 
 (21, finns, 16), 
 (22, inne, 23), 
 (23, i, 25), 
 (24, varje, 25), 
 (25, polyp, 21), 
 (26, ., 21)]

In this tree:

- The main verb of the sentence is 'blir' (index 2), which is the head of the sentence.
- 'Färgglada' (index 3) is an adjective phrase modifying 'Polyperna' (index 1), so it depends on 'blir' (index 2).
- 'Får' (index 5) is a verb phrase also dependent on 'blir' through 'och' (index 4).
- 'fotosyntes' (index 7) is the object of 'genom' (index 6), and the whole phrase is dependent on 'får'.
- 'Ca 90 %' (indices 8-10) is a numerical phrase, where 'ca' (index 8) modifies '90' (index 9), and '%' (index 10) modifies '90' too. The whole phrase modifies 'energi'.
- The comma (index 12) is attached to 'energi' as its head, separating the main clauses.
- The main clause is attached to 'tack' (index 13), connected through a dependent 'vare' (index 14).
- The sentence 'den grönalg zooxanthell som finns i varje polyp' is dependent on the head 'zooxanthell' (index 18) and describes its properties, but 'grönalg' is modifying 'zooxanthell' (index 16) and so has 'zooxanthell' as a head.
- 'Som' is introducing the subordinate clause describing 'zooxanthell', and so is its head.
- The whole description of zooxanthell is part of the more complex structure and depends on the main clause head through commas and subordinating conjunctions, connected to the 'finns' head.
