To analyze the given Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, I'll first tokenize the sentence. Here's the tokenization:

1. Ransoneringskorten
2. skulle
3. garantera
4. att
5. folket
6. fick
7. tillgång
8. till
9. mat
10. och
11. kläder
12. ,
13. fördelat
14. rättvist
15. mellan
16. alla
17. hushåll
18. .

Next, I'll create a dependency tree for the sentence. Here's the result:

[(1, Ransoneringskorten, 3), 
 (2, skulle, 3), 
 (3, garantera, 2), 
 (4, att, 6), 
 (5, folket, 6), 
 (6, fick, 4), 
 (7, tillgång, 6), 
 (8, till, 9), 
 (9, mat, 11), 
 (10, och, 11), 
 (11, kläder, 7), 
 (12, ,, 13), 
 (13, fördelat, 11), 
 (14, rättvist, 15), 
 (15, mellan, 16), 
 (16, alla, 17), 
 (17, hushåll, 13), 
 (18, ., 3)]

In this dependency tree:

- The sentence starts with the main verb "garantera" (3), which is in the infinitive form due to being in a subordinate clause after "skulle" (2).
- "Ransoneringskorten" (1) is the subject of "garantera".
- The sentence contains a subordinate clause "att folket fick tillgång till mat och kläder" (4-12), where "fick" (6) is the main verb and "folket" (5) is the subject. 
- Within this clause, "tillgång" (7) is a direct object of the verb "fick".
- "till" (8) is a preposition which has "mat" (9) as its complement.
- "och" (10) is a coordinating conjunction, and "kläder" (11) is a conjunct.
- After the comma (12), there's another subordinate clause "fördelat rättvist mellan alla hushåll" modifying the main clause.
- "fördelat" (13) is the main verb, with "hushåll" (17) being the object of the preposition "mellan" (15), which is itself the complement of the verb.
- "rättvist" (14) is an adverb modifying "fördelat".
- "alla" (16) is an adjective modifying "hushåll".
- The full stop (18) is a punctuation mark, and its head is the main verb of the sentence, "garantera" (3).
