To analyze the given Swedish sentence, we will first split it into tokens, including punctuation marks. Then, we'll determine the dependency relationships between the tokens.

Given sentence:
"Lully utvecklade recitativ genom att modellera musiken på den franska språkmelodin med noggrann rytm och intonation."

Splitting the sentence into tokens:

1. Lully
2. utvecklade
3. recitativ
4. genom
5. att
6. modellera
7. musiken
8. på
9. den
10. franska
11. språkmelodin
12. med
13. noggrann
14. rytm
15. och
16. intonation.

Dependency analysis:

* "Lully" (1) is the subject of the sentence, so it depends on "utvecklade" (2).
* "utvecklade" (2) is the root of the sentence (i.e., it has no dependency), but since we have to assign a head, we'll assign it 0.
* "recitativ" (3) is the direct object of "utvecklade" (2), so it depends on "utvecklade" (2).
* "genom" (4) is a preposition introducing the subordinate clause, so it depends on "utvecklade" (2).
* "att" (5) is an infinitive marker introducing the infinitive "modellera" (6), so it depends on "genom" (4).
* "modellera" (6) is the infinitive verb, so it depends on "att" (5). However, considering the actual meaning of the sentence, we could say it depends on "utvecklade" (2) or "genom" (4). The dependency could be modeled both ways.
* "musiken" (7) is the direct object of "modellera" (6), so it depends on "modellera" (6).
* "på" (8) is a preposition introducing the phrase "den franska språkmelodin" (9-11), so it depends on "modellera" (6).
* "den" (9) is the determiner of "franska" (10), so it depends on "franska" (10).
* "franska" (10) is the adjective modifying "språkmelodin" (11), so it depends on "språkmelodin" (11).
* "språkmelodin" (11) is the object of the preposition "på" (8), so it depends on "på" (8). However, considering the actual meaning of the sentence, we could say it depends on "modellera" (6). The dependency could be modeled both ways.
* "med" (12) is a preposition introducing the phrase "noggrann rytm och intonation." (13-16), so it depends on "modellera" (6).
* "noggrann" (13) is the adjective modifying "rytm" (14), so it depends on "rytm" (14).
* "rytm" (14) is the object of the preposition "med" (12), so it depends on "med" (12). However, considering the actual meaning of the sentence, we could say it depends on "modellera" (6). The dependency could be modeled both ways.
* "och" (15) is a conjunction connecting "rytm" (14) and "intonation" (16), so it depends on "rytm" (14) or "intonation" (16). However, considering the actual meaning of the sentence, we could say it depends on "med" (12) or "modellera" (6). The dependency could be modeled both ways.
* "intonation" (16) is the second element of the conjunction "och" (15), so it depends on "och" (15). However, considering the actual meaning of the sentence, we could say it depends on "med" (12) or "modellera" (6). The dependency could be modeled both ways.
