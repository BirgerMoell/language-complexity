Now, let's create a dependency tree for the given sentence. I'll denote each token with its index and provide the head token index for each token.

- Barnfamiljer (1) is the main subject, and the main verb is "anses" (13), so "Barnfamiljer" (1) should be attached to "anses" (13) as a subject: (1, Barnfamiljer, 13)
- "som" (2) is a subordinating conjunction introducing a subordinate clause, which functions as an adjective to "Barnfamiljer" (1): (2, som, 1)
- "vistats" (3) is the main verb of the subordinate clause, attached to "som" (2): (3, vistats, 2)
- "i" (4) is a preposition introducing a location: (4, i, 3)
- "Sverige" (5) is the object of the preposition "i": (5, Sverige, 4)
- "i" (6) is another preposition introducing a time: (6, i, 3)
- "minst" (7) is an adverb modifying the following phrase: (7, minst, 8)
- 4 (8) is the main adverb here, connected to "i" (6): (8, 4, 6)
- "år" (9) is a noun indicating time, also connected to "i" (6): (9, år, 6)
- "som" (10) is another subordinating conjunction introducing a new clause: (10, som, 3)
- "sökande" (11) is the main verb of the new clause, attached to "som" (10): (11, sökande, 10)
- "," (12) is a punctuation mark, usually doesn't connect to other words in the tree: No connection
- "anses" (13) is the main verb of the main clause: (13, anses, 0) (root of the tree)
- "ha" (14) is a auxiliary verb connected to "anses" (13): (14, ha, 13)
- "skäl" (15) is a noun and the main object of "anses" (13) via "ha" (14): (15, skäl, 14)
- "på" (16) is a preposition introducing a reason: (16, på, 15)
- "grund" (17) is a noun and the object of the preposition "på": (17, grund, 16)
- "av" (18) is a preposition introducing a reason: (18, av, 17)
- "vistelsetiden" (19) is a noun and the object of "av" (18): (19, vistelsetiden, 18)
- "." (20) is a punctuation mark, usually doesn't connect to other words in the tree: No connection

Here is the resulting dependency tree in the specified format:

[(1, Barnfamiljer, 13),
 (2, som, 1),
 (3, vistats, 2),
 (4, i, 3),
 (5, Sverige, 4),
 (6, i, 3),
 (7, minst, 8),
 (8, 4, 6),
 (9, år, 6),
 (10, som, 3),
 (11, sökande, 10),
 (12, ,, 0),
 (13, anses, 0),
 (14, ha, 13),
 (15, skäl, 14),
 (16, på, 15),
 (17, grund, 16),
 (18, av, 17),
 (19, vistelsetiden, 18),
 (20, ., 0)]

Note that, although commas and other punctuation marks are tokens in the dependency tree, they're not always connected to the rest of the tree as they're not grammar-carrying tokens. However, punctuation tokens like
