To analyze the provided Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we break down the sentence into its tokens and determine their relationships. The dependency tree is constructed based on the grammatical structure of the sentence.

Here's the output for the given sentence: 

```
[(1, Man, 2), 
 (2, hoppas, 0), 
 (3, att, 2), 
 (4, detta, 5), 
 (5, skall, 2), 
 (6, påverka, 5), 
 (7, datorföretagen, 6), 
 (8, så, 9), 
 (9, att, 10), 
 (10, de, 12), 
 (11, börjar, 10), 
 (12, använda, 11), 
 (13, något, 14), 
 (14, annat, 12), 
 (15, miljövänligare, 14), 
 (16, sätt, 14), 
 (17, att, 16), 
 (18, flammskydda, 17), 
 (19, sina, 20), 
 (20, monitorer, 18), 
 (21, ., 2)]
```

In this output:
- Each tuple consists of a token index, the token itself, and the index of its head token.
- The head of a token is determined based on the grammatical link it has with another word in the sentence.
