To analyze the given Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we can break down the sentence into its components, identifying the relations between them.

Here is the dependency tree output for the sentence provided:

```
[
    (1, Telefonlinjerna, 2),
    (2, avlyssnades, 0),
    (3, av, 2),
    (4, det, 3),
    (5, svenska, 6),
    (6, försvaret, 4),
    (7, och, 2),
    (8, 1940, 2),
    (9, lyckades, 2),
    (10, den, 9),
    (11, matematikiska, 12),
    (12, professorn, 10),
    (13, Arne, 12),
    (14, Beurling, 12),
    (15, knäcka, 9),
    (16, den, 15),
    (17, tyska, 18),
    (18, kodmaskinen, 15),
    (19, Geheimfernschreiber, 18),
    (20, och, 9),
    (21, Sverige, 20),
    (22, kunde, 20),
    (23, avlyssna, 22),
    (24, hemliga, 25),
    (25, samtal, 23)
]
```

In this representation:
- Each tuple (token index, token, head index) illustrates the structure of the sentence, where 'head index' indicates the index of the head word to which the token is connected. 
- The dependency structure captures the grammatical relationships between the words in the sentence.
