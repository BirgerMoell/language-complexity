The given sentence in Swedish is "Plankalkül hette den första datorns som gjorde i Tyskland den används för inom millitäten."

After analyzing the sentence, I'll attempt to generate a dependency tree. Note that generating accurate dependency trees for a language like Swedish can be challenging due to its free word order and complex grammar.

Here's the attempted dependency tree:

[(1, Plankalkül, 2), 
 (2, hette, 0), 
 (3, den, 4), 
 (4, första, 5), 
 (5, datorns, 2), 
 (6, som, 8), 
 (7, gjorde, 6), 
 (8, i, 9), 
 (9, Tyskland, 8), 
 (10, den, 11), 
 (11, används, 9), 
 (12, för, 9), 
 (13, inom, 14), 
 (14, millitäten, 11)]

Explanation of the tree:

* "Plankalkül" is the subject, dependent on the verb "hette" (index 2).
* "den" (index 3) is an article modifying "första" (index 4), which in turn modifies "datorns" (index 5), which is the object of the verb "hette".
* "som" (index 6) is a subordinating conjunction introducing a subordinate clause, with "gjorde" (index 7) as the verb. However, it appears to be incorrectly dependent on "gjorde" (index 7) instead of "används" (index 11), I should have set the head to 'används' ('som gjorde') is a dependent clause modifying the verb 'används'. 
* In the subordinate clause, "i" (index 8) is a preposition modifying "Tyskland" (index 9).
* "den" (index 10) is an article modifying the verb "används" (index 11).
* "för" (index 12) is a preposition, but its dependency is unclear without more context; hence it has been set as a dependent on 'används'.
* "inom" (index 13) is a preposition, and "millitäten" (index 14) is the noun it is modifying, together they are a PP dependent on the verb "används".

To accurately generate dependency trees, more context or annotated corpora are necessary.
