To create a dependency tree for the provided Swedish sentence, we first tokenize the sentence and identify the syntactic relationships between the words. The sentence you provided is quite complex and contains multiple clauses. Here's the output for the entire sentence:

```
[(1, De, 2), (2, hade, 0), (3, så, 2), (4, spridit, 2), (5, rykten, 4), (6, om, 4), (7, mörkrets, 8), (8, hav, 6), 
(9, för, 10), (10, att, 11), (11, skydda, 10), (12, sina, 13), (13, tillgångar, 11), (14, Hur, 15), (15, skulle, 0), 
(16, dyra, 17), (17, varor, 15), (18, från, 19), (19, Asien, 18), (20, kunna, 15), (21, bli, 20), (22, billigare, 21), 
(23, i, 24), (24, Europa, 23), (25, Handel, 26), (26, runt, 25), (27, Asien, 26), (28, var, 26), (29, uppbyggd, 28), 
(30, på, 29), (31, många, 32), (32, händer, 30), (33, och, 34), (34, alla, 33), (35, skulle, 36), (36, känna, 34), 
(37, på, 36), (38, affärerna, 37), (39, ., 2)]
```

In this output:
- Each triple consists of an index, the word (token), and the index of its head (governing word).
- The main verb "hade" serves as the root (head) of the first clause, while "skulle" serves as the root for the second clause.
- The punctuation mark at the end is also included as a separate token. 

This tree may vary depending on the exact parsing method used, but it provides a reasonable approximation of the dependencies in the sentence.
