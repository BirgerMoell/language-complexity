The provided Swedish sentence is a complex one, and its dependency tree will be as follows:

[(1, Ju, 4), 
(2, mer, 4), 
(3, man, 4), 
(4, möter, 7), 
(5, människor, 8), 
(6, med, 7), 
(7, annan, 5), 
(8, bakgrund, 4), 
(9, ju, 12), 
(10, mer, 12), 
(11, förstår, 13), 
(12, man, 13), 
(13, att, 14), 
(14, det, 16), 
(15, ligger, 16), 
(16, mycket, 15), 
(17, lite, 18), 
(18, i, 20), 
(19, alla, 20), 
(20, de, 22), 
(21, fördomar, 22), 
(22, som, 23), 
(23, finns, 20), 
(24, utspridda, 23), 
(25, i, 27), 
(26, samhället, 25), 
(27, ., 0)]

Some notes on the analysis:

- The dependency tree represents the grammatical structure of the sentence, where each word is represented by a token index, the word itself, and the head word. The head word is the word to which a given word is grammatically related.
- In this sentence, the main verb 'möter' (to meet) is complemented by other clauses and phrases, all of which are grammatically related to 'möter' or its subject 'man'.
- The sentence uses a complex construction with a comparison ('Ju mer...ju mer...'), where 'Ju mer man möter människor med annan bakgrund' is the first clause and 'ju mer förstår man att...' is the second clause. The two clauses are related to each other.
- 'att' is a subordinating conjunction introducing a subordinate clause ('att...').
- 'lite' is dependent on 'mycket', indicating a degree or intensity.
- 'i' is used twice as a preposition ('i alla' and 'i samhället'), connecting its noun complements ('alla' and 'samhället') to the verb 'finns' and to 'utspridda' respectively.
- The period at the end of the sentence has no head; thus it's represented with 0.
- In dependency trees, usually, punctuation is either left out or given a special token with no head in the tree.
