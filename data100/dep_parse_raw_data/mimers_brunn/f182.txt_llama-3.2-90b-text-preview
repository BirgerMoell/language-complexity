To analyze the given Swedish sentence and create a dependency tree, I will break it down into individual tokens and assign each token a unique index. Then, I will identify the head word for each token and its corresponding index. Here's the breakdown and the resulting dependency tree:

1. Det
2. högsta
3. födelsetalet
4. är
5. i
6. Väst
7. och
8. Östafrika
9. ,
10. som
11. också
12. hade
13. den
14. högsta
15. tillväxten
16. (
17. 2
18. )

The dependency tree can be constructed as follows:

- "Det" is the subject and depends on the main verb "är" with index 4: (1, Det, 4)
- "högsta" is an adjective that describes "födelsetalet" and depends on it with index 3: (2, högsta, 3)
- "födelsetalet" is the object and depends on the main verb "är" with index 4: (3, födelsetalet, 4)
- "är" is the main verb and is the root of the sentence (the head of the main clause) with index 0: (4, är, 0)
- "i" is a preposition that introduces the phrase and depends on "är" with index 4: (5, i, 4)
- "Väst" is a part of the phrase "Väst och Östafrika" and is coordinated with "Östafrika" with index 8, where "Östafrika" is the head: (6, Väst, 8)
- "och" is a coordinating conjunction and depends on the head of the coordinated phrase "Östafrika" with index 8: (7, och, 8)
- "Östafrika" is the head of the phrase and depends on "i" with index 5: (8, Östafrika, 5)
- The comma (,) is a punctuation mark and depends on the sentence (main verb) with index 4: (9,,, 4)
- "som" is a subordinating conjunction that introduces the clause and depends on the main clause "Östafrika" with index 8: (10, som, 8)
- "också" is an adverb that depends on the verb "hade" with index 12: (11, också, 12)
- "hade" is the main verb of the subordinate clause and depends on the sentence (main clause) with index 4 (but could also be argued to depend on the conjunction "som" with index 10, this is a point of debate among different dependency grammar theories): (12, hade, 4)
- "den" is an article that describes "högsta" and depends on "högsta" with index 14: (13, den, 14)
- "högsta" is an adjective that describes "tillväxten" and depends on "tillväxten" with index 15: (14, högsta, 15)
- "tillväxten" is the object of the subordinate clause and depends on the main verb "hade" with index 12: (15, tillväxten, 12)
- The opening parenthesis is not grammatically connected to the rest of the sentence and most likely starts a number designation ("(2.") referring to a citation or a figure:  (16, (, -1) or ignoring this for simplicity.
- The number "2" is not grammatically connected to the rest of the sentence and most likely completes a number designation ("(2.") referring to a citation or a figure:  (17, 2, -1) or ignoring this for simplicity.
- The last closing parenthesis is not grammatically connected to the rest of the sentence and most likely ends a number designation ("(2.") referring to a citation or a figure: (18, ), -1) or ignoring this for simplicity.

The final dependency tree for the given sentence is:

(1, Det, 4)
(2, högsta, 3)
(3, födelsetalet, 4)
(4, är, 0)
(5, i, 4)
(6, Väst, 8)
(7, och, 8)
(8, Östafrika, 5)
(9, ,, 4)
(10, som, 8)
(11, också, 12)
(12, hade, 4)
(13, den, 14)
(14, högsta, 15)
(15, tillväxten, 12)
