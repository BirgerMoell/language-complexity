To analyze the provided Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree for it, we'll identify the tokens and their relationships. Here's the breakdown of the sentence: 

1. **Besöker** is the main verb.
2. **du** is the subject of the verb **besöker**.
3. **en sida** is a noun phrase and the object of the verb.
4. **om till exempel antivirus program** is a prepositional phrase that modifies **sida**.
5. **kan** is a modal verb governing the verb **hända**.
6. **det** is an anticipatory subject for the verb **hända**.
7. **hända** is the main verb of the clause initiated by **kan**.
8. **att** introduces a subordinate clause.
9. **det** is again an anticipatory subject for the verb **kommer**.
10. **kommer** is the main verb of that subordinate clause.
11. **upp** is a particle modifying **kommer**.
12. **ett litet fönster** is the object of **kommer**.
13. **som tipsar om andra antivirus program** is a relative clause modifying **fönster**.

Now, putting that together into a dependency tree format:

```

 (2, du, 0), 
 (3, en, 4), 
 (4, sida, 2), 
 (5, om, 4),
