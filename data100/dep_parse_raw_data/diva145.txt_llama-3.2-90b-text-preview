The provided sentence is in English, not Swedish. Here's the dependency tree analysis for the given sentence:

1. Since -> (Root of the sentence, no head)
2. the -> MOD (modifies climate, governed by climate)
3. climate -> NMOD (nominal modifier in the phrase "the climate in the attics")
4. in -> PREP (prepositional modifier, governing "attics", but its head is actually "climate" for context)
5. the -> DET (determiner of the noun "attics")
6. attics -> NMOD (prepositional object, governed by "climate")
7. is -> LINK (link verb, represents the state of being)
8. dependent -> XCOMP (dependent modifier, governed by "is")
9. on -> PREP (prepositional modifier, governing "outdoor climate", but its head is actually "dependent" for context)
10. the -> DET (determiner of the noun "outdoor climate")
11. outdoor -> MOD (adjectival modifier, governance relation with "climate")
12. climate -> NMOD (governed by "on")
13. , -> PUNCT (sentential punctuation separating phrases)
14. it -> NMOD (personal pronoun in passive construction, governed by "was decided")
15. was -> LINK (link verb, represents state of being)
16. decided -> ACSUBJ (active subject in passive construction, governed by "was")
17. that -> SUBORD (subordinating conjunction, introducing the dependent clause)
18. outdoor -> MOD (adjectival modifier, governing "climate")
19. climate -> DOBJ (object of the verb "collected")
20. data -> NMOD (nominal apposition, governance relation with "climate")
21. would -> AUX (auxiliary of the verb "collected")
22. be -> LINK (link verb, represents the state of being)
23. collected -> DOBJ (object of the dependent clause "would be collected", governed by "decided")
24. as -> PREP (prepositional modifier of adverbial manner, governing "well")
25. well -> ADV (adverbial phrase governed by "as")

Now, here's the output in the given format, with the token indices adjusted:

[(1, Since, 0), (2, the, 3), (3, climate, 7), (4, in, 6), (5, the, 6), (6, attics, 3), (7, is, 8), (8, dependent, 7), (9, on, 12), (10, the, 11), (11, outdoor, 12), (12, climate, 9), (13, , 14), (14, it, 16), (15, was, 16), (16, decided, 0), (17, that, 23), (18, outdoor, 20), (19, climate, 20), (20, data, 19), (21, would, 23), (22, be, 23), (23, collected, 16), (24, as, 25), (25, well, 24)]

Note that in the process of simplifying the dependency relations into this output format, some of the nuance of the relationships is lost. A visual dependency parser like SpaCy (based on the original output provided for a parse of the original prompt), would offer a clearer outline in relation to constituent groups.
