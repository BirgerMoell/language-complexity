To analyze the provided English sentence and produce a dependency tree, I will break down the sentence into its token components and identify their grammatical relationships.

Sentence: "The city is currently growing and densifying in a rapid pace and most of the new buildings are being built in existing environments."

Here's the dependency tree output for this sentence:

```
[
    (1, The, 2),
    (2, city, 0),
    (3, is, 2),
    (4, currently, 3),
    (5, growing, 3),
    (6, and, 5),
    (7, densifying, 5),
    (8, in, 9),
    (9, a, 11),
    (10, rapid, 11),
    (11, pace, 8),
    (12, and, 5),
    (13, most, 16),
    (14, of, 16),
    (15, the, 16),
    (16, new, 18),
    (17, buildings, 16),
    (18, are, 16),
    (19, being, 18),
    (20, built, 19),
    (21, in, 22),
    (22, existing, 23),
    (23, environments, 21)
]
```

In this dependency tree:
- Each token is indexed.
- The head index signifies the grammatical relationship of each token to its head. For example, "city" is the subject linked to "is," while "growing" and "densifying" are both verbs linked to "is."
