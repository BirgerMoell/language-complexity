To analyze the provided Swedish sentence and produce its dependency tree, we first need to break down the sentence into its tokens and determine their grammatical relations. Here's a representation of the dependency tree:

```
[(1, Om, 2), 
 (2, en, 3), 
 (3, union, 4), 
 (4, hade, 5), 
 (5, skapats, 0), 
 (6, tror, 0), 
 (7, jag, 6), 
 (8, att, 17), 
 (9, Tyskland, 8), 
 (10, inte, 9), 
 (11, hade, 12), 
 (12, gått, 8), 
 (13, med, 12), 
 (14, på, 12), 
 (15, att, 16), 
 (16, Sovjet, 15), 
 (17, skulle, 8), 
 (18, ta, 17), 
 (19, Finland, 18), 
 (20, i, 21), 
 (21, molontovribbentovpakten, 18), 
 (22, eftersom, 0), 
 (23, Sverige, 22), 
 (24, exporterade, 23), 
 (25, järnmalm, 24), 
 (26, till, 24), 
 (27, Tyskland, 26)]
```

Here’s a brief breakdown of what the elements in the tuples represent:

- The first number indicates the token's index in the sentence.
- The second is the token (word).
- The third is the index of the head token to which the current token is related (or 0 if it has no head, indicating it's the root of the sentence). 

This structure depicts the syntactic relationships among the words in the sentence according to dependency grammar principles.
