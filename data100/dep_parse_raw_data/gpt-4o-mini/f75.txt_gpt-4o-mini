To analyze the given Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we can break down the sentence into its components and identify the head relationships. Here is the output in the desired format:

```plaintext
[
    (1, När, 2),
    (2, de, 6),
    (3, ska, 6),
    (4, leva, 6),
    (5, tillsammans, 4),
    (6, skapas, 0),
    (7, det, 6),
    (8, därför, 6),
    (9, problem, 8),
    (10, eftersom, 12),
    (11, de, 12),
    (12, uppfattar, 9),
    (13, verkligheten, 12),
    (14, olika, 13),
    (15, ., 6)
]
```

In this structure:
- Each tuple consists of (token index, token, head index).
- The head index of "skapas" (6) is set to 0, indicating it is the root of the sentence. 
- The relationships among the words reflect their grammatical roles and dependencies.
