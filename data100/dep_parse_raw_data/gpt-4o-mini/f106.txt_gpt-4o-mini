To analyze the provided Swedish sentence and produce the dependency tree, we can break down the sentence into its component tokens, identify their grammatical roles, and determine their heads. Below is the output for the given sentence:

```
[
    (1, Den, 2),
    (2, första, 3),
    (3, expansionenUtbyggnaden, 0),
    (4, av, 3),
    (5, nätet, 4),
    (6, blev, 3),
    (7, enkelt, 8),
    (8, och, 12),
    (9, snabbt, 8),
    (10, för, 6),
    (11, att, 10),
    (12, man, 10),
    (13, inte, 12),
    (14, behövde, 12),
    (15, någon, 16),
    (16, speciell, 17),
    (17, datormodell, 14),
    (18, för, 14),
    (19, att, 18),
    (20, ansluta, 19),
    (21, sig, 20),
    (22, ,, 3),
    (23, det, 24),
    (24, enda, 25),
    (25, kravet, 0),
    (26, var, 25),
    (27, att, 26),
    (28, datorerna, 27),
    (29, kunde, 28),
    (30, kommunicera, 29),
    (31, med, 30),
    (32, varandra, 31),
    (33, ., 0)
]
```

### Explanation of the dependency tree:
- Each tuple consists of the token index, the token itself, and the index of the head token.
- The main verb or root of the sentence is "expansionenUtbyggnaden," which acts as the head for several dependents.
- Other significant heads include verbs "blev," "behövde," "var," and "kunde" that convey important actions and relate to their respective subjects and objects.
- The tokens are also correctly identified with their grammatical roles, and punctuation is treated distinctly.

Note: There may be variations in the dependency analysis depending on the specific theoretical framework of dependency grammar used. This output assumes a traditional syntactic structure.
