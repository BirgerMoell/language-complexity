To analyze the Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we first break it down into its tokens and analyze their dependencies. Here's the result:

1. Identifier the tokens:
   - Delarna
   - sätter
   - man
   - in
   - i
   - så
   - kallade
   - I/O-portar
   - (In/Out-portar)
   - ,
   - och
   - desto
   - fler
   - sådana
   - man
   - har
   - ,
   - desto
   - fler
   - grafikkort
   - och
   - ljudkort
   - m
   - .

2. Structure the dependencies:
   - "Delarna" is the subject (depended on "sätter").
   - "sätter" is the main verb.
   - "man" is an agent of the verb "sätter".
   - "in" indicates direction (dependent on "sätter").
   - "i" indicates location (dependent on "in").
   - "så" modifies "kallade".
   - "kallade" modifies "I/O-portar".
   - "(In/Out-portar)" is an apposition to "I/O-portar".
   - "," connects clauses.
   - "och" connects two phrases.
   - "desto" indicates a comparative relation, modifying "fler".
   - "fler" refers back to "man" as its subject.
   - "sådana" modifies "fler".
   - "har" is the verb of the second clause.
   - The second "," before "desto".
   - The final "m" is often treated as a shorthand for "med".

Dependency relationships result in the following tree representation:

```plaintext
[
 (1, Delarna, 2),
 (2, sätter, 0),
 (3, man, 2),
 (4, in, 2),
 (5, i, 4),
 (6, så, 8),
 (7, kallade, 6),
 (8, I/O-portar, 4),
 (9, (In/Out-portar), 8),
 (10, ,, 2),
 (11, och, 10),
 (12, desto, 14),
 (13, fler, 12),
 (14, sådana, 12),
 (15, man, 14),
 (16, har, 15),
 (17, ,, 16),
 (18, desto, 20),
 (19, fler, 18),
 (20, grafikkort, 19),
 (21, och, 20),
 (22, ljudkort, 21),
 (23, m, 22),
 (24, ., 2)
]
```

Each tuple consists of the token index, the token itself, and the index of its head token, as required. Note that the tree may appear different depending on interpretations of relationships, but this reflects the most logical dependencies in context.
