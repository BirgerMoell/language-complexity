To analyze the given Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we will identify the tokens, their relationships, and the head tokens for each. Here's the output based on the provided sentence:

```
[(1, EGR-systemet, 2), 
 (2, som, 5), 
 (3, används, 5), 
 (4, i, 5), 
 (5, detta, 6), 
 (6, examensarbete, 3), 
 (7, använder, 0), 
 (8, sig, 7), 
 (9, av, 7), 
 (10, en, 11), 
 (11, delad, 12), 
 (12, avgaskanal, 9), 
 (13, där, 14), 
 (14, den, 16), 
 (15, ena, 16), 
 (16, kanalen, 13), 
 (17, och, 18), 
 (18, ventilen, 16), 
 (19, används, 7), 
 (20, för, 19), 
 (21, att, 22), 
 (22, föra, 20), 
 (23, tillbaka, 22), 
 (24, EGR, 25), 
 (25, till, 26), 
 (26, insugssidan, 24), 
 (27, ., 0)]
```

In this tree:
- Each token is indexed sequentially.
- The second item in each triple is the token itself.
- The third item indicates the index of the head token (0 if it is a root). 

This structure maintains the correct relationships as described in the original sentence.
