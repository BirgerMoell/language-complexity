To analyze the provided sentence and produce a dependency tree, we first identify the tokens and their respective heads. Here's the tokenized structure:

1. However
2. ,
3. VIP
4. make
5. it
6. possible
7. to
8. reduce
9. the
10. thickness
11. of
12. the
13. building
14. envelope
15. and
16. you
17. can
18. thereby
19. increase
20. the
21. area
22. for
23. selling
24. with
25. increased
26. income
27. as
28. a
29. result
30. .

Now, we determine the heads for each token:

1. However (2)
2. , (1)
3. VIP (4)
4. make (0)
5. it (4)
6. possible (4)
7. to (8)
8. reduce (6)
9. the (10)
10. thickness (8)
11. of (12)
12. the (14)
13. building (12)
14. envelope (8)
15. and (4)
16. you (19)
17. can (16)
18. thereby (19)
19. increase (16)
20. the (21)
21. area (19)
22. for (23)
23. selling (21)
24. with (25)
25. increased (24)
26. income (24)
27. as (30)
28. a (29)
29. result (27)
30. . (1)

Now, we'll format the output accordingly:
