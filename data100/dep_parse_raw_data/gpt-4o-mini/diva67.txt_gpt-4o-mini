Here is the dependency tree analysis for the provided Swedish sentence:

1. Tokenize the sentence:
   - The
   - number
   - of
   - experts
   - responsible
   - for
   - different
   - parts
   - of
   - the
   - design
   - should
   - ,
   - however
   - ,
   - be
   - kept
   - to
   - a
   - minimum
   - .

2. Create the dependency tree structure:
   - The dependency tree for the sentence will look like this:

```
[
    (1, The, 2),
    (2, number, 0),
    (3, of, 4),
    (4, experts, 2),
    (5, responsible, 4),
    (6, for, 7),
    (7, different, 5),
    (8, parts, 2),
    (9, of, 10),
    (10, the, 11),
    (11, design, 5),
    (12, should, 0),
    (13, ,, 12),
    (14, however, 12),
    (15, ,, 12),
    (16, be, 18),
    (17, kept, 12),
    (18, to, 19),
    (19, a, 20),
    (20, minimum, 17),
    (21, ., 12)
]
```

Here, the indices represent the tokens in the sentence, and their dependencies point to their head tokens. Note that the "0" indicates the root of the sentence.
