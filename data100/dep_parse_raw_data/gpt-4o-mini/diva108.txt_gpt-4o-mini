To analyze the provided Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we first break down the sentence into its constituent tokens and then identify their grammatical relationships. Here's the resulting dependency tree for the sentence:

1. Rising
2. costs
3. of
4. energy
5. ,
6. combined
7. with
8. an
9. increasing
10. environmental
11. consciousness
12. on
13. the
14. part
15. of
16. building
17. owners
18. ,
19. render
20. timely
21. the
22. law
23. on
24. certification
25. of
26. buildings
27. for
28. energy
29. efficiency
30. .

Now, the dependency relationships can be expressed as follows:

```
[(1, Rising, 2),
 (2, costs, 19),
 (3, of, 2),
 (4, energy, 3),
 (5, ,, 2),
 (6, combined, 2),
 (7, with, 6),
 (8, an, 9),
 (9, increasing, 10),
 (10, environmental, 11),
 (11, consciousness, 12),
 (12, on, 14),
 (13, the, 14),
 (14, part, 2),
 (15, of, 14),
 (16, building, 17),
 (17, owners, 14),
 (18, ,, 19),
 (19, render, 0),
 (20, timely, 19),
 (21, the, 22),
 (22, law, 19),
 (23, on, 24),
 (24, certification, 25),
 (25, of, 24),
 (26, buildings, 25),
 (27, for, 24),
 (28, energy, 29),
 (29, efficiency, 28),
 (30, ., 19)]
```

In this list:
- The first number is the token index.
- The second entry is the token itself.
- The final number is the index of the head token. The root of the sentence (in this case, "render") is given a head index of 0.
