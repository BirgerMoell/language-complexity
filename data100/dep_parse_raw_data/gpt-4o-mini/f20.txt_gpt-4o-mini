To analyze the provided Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we break down the sentence into its components, identifying tokens and their grammatical relationships. Here is the analysis for the sentence: 

"Man trodde att de som hade en tattuering var en buse 'lagförbrytare' men så var det absolut inte."

The resulting dependency tree is as follows:

```plaintext
[
    (1, Man, 2),
    (2, trodde, 0),
    (3, att, 2),
    (4, de, 5),
    (5, som, 6),
    (6, hade, 2),
    (7, en, 8),
    (8, tattuering, 6),
    (9, var, 2),
    (10, en, 11),
    (11, buse, 9),
    (12, "lagförbrytare", 11),
    (13, men, 2),
    (14, så, 15),
    (15, var, 2),
    (16, det, 15),
    (17, absolut, 15),
    (18, inte, 15),
    (19, ., 2)
]
```

Here, each tuple consists of the token index, the token itself, and the index of the head token to which it is connected in the dependency structure. The head tokens indicate the relationships within the sentence.
