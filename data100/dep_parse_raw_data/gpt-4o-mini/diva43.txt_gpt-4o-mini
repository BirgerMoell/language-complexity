To analyze the given Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we break down the sentence into its tokens and determine their relationships. Here’s the output for the specified sentence:

```plaintext

    (25, deras, 24), 
    (26, behov, 25), 
    (27, ., 2)
]
```

This dependency tree represents the syntactic structure of the sentence, with each token pointing to its syntactic head. The root of the sentence is indicated with a head index of 0, which corresponds to the main verb 'är'.
