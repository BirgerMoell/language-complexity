To analyze the provided Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we'll break the sentence into tokens and identify their relationships. Hereâ€™s the process followed by the final output:

1. Tokenize the sentence:
   - An
   - IPM
   - from
   - International
   - Rectifier
   - has
   - been
   - modified
   - and
   - tested
   - by
   - letting
   - the
   - IPM
   - drive
   - a
   - permanent
   - magnet
   - motor
   - under
   - typical
   - load
   - conditions
   - for
   - a
   - long
   - time
   - .

2. Establish dependencies:
   - "An" modifies "IPM"
   - "from" indicates the source for "IPM"
   - "International Rectifier" is a compound proper noun that serves as the entity name for "from"
   - "has" indicates the auxiliary verb for "modified" and "tested"
   - "modified" and "tested" are coordinated (joined by "and")
   - "by" introduces the agent in passive constructions
   - "letting" serves as a gerund that describes the action to create dependencies for what follows
   - "the IPM" serves as the subject for "drive"
   - "drive" is the main verb for "a motor"
   - "a permanent magnet motor" serves as the direct object
   - "under typical load conditions" provides additional context about "drive"
   - "for a long time" indicates the duration for "drive"

3. Dependency tree structure:
```
[
 (1, An, 2),
 (2, IPM, 3),
 (3, from, 7),
 (4, International, 5),
 (5, Rectifier, 3),
 (6, has, 8),
 (7, been, 6),
 (8, modified, 6),
 (9, and, 10),
 (10, tested, 8),
 (11, by, 13),
 (12, letting, 11),
 (13, the, 15),
 (14, IPM, 13),
 (15, drive, 12),
 (16, a, 18),
 (17, permanent, 18),
 (18, magnet, 19),
 (19, motor, 15),
 (20, under, 22),
 (21, typical, 22),
 (22, load, 23),
 (23, conditions, 20),
 (24, for, 26),
 (25, a, 26),
 (26, long, 27),
 (27, time, 24),
 (28, ., 6)
]
```

This tree structure connects the tokens based on their grammatical dependencies within the sentence.
