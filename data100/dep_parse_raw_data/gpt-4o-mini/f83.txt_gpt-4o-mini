To analyze the provided Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we first tokenize the sentence and identify the grammatical relationships between those tokens. Here’s the output for the dependency tree of the provided sentence:

```
[
    (1, Det, 2),
    (2, kan, 3),
    (3, låta, 0),
    (4, som, 3),
    (5, om, 4),
    (6, detta, 7),
    (7, inte, 8),
    (8, är, 3),
    (9, ett, 10),
    (10, så, 11),
    (11, stort, 8),
    (12, problem, 11),
    (13, för, 14),
    (14, de, 15),
    (15, som, 14),
    (16, inte, 17),
    (17, drabbas, 15),
    (18, personligen, 17),
    (19, men, 20),
    (20, låt, 0),
    (21, oss, 22),
    (22, ta, 20),
    (23, en, 24),
    (24, till, 25),
    (25, på, 26),
    (26, möjliga, 27),
    (27, konsekvenser, 25),
    (28, av, 29),
    (29, diskrimineringen, 25)
]
```

In this output:
- Each tuple consists of three elements: (token index, token itself, head token index).
- The root of the sentence (the main verb "låta") has a head index of 0, indicating it is the top node in the tree.
