I will break down the given sentence into its constituent parts and generate the corresponding dependency tree.

 Sentence: Till Sverige kom sporten/hobbyn under 1700-talet och blev efter ett tag en populär söndagshobby.

## Dependency Tree Construction
- **1 (Till)** is a preposition (PP) and is dependent on **3 (kom)**, which is the main verb of the sentence.
- **2 (Sverige)** is the object of the preposition and is dependent on **1 (Till)**.
- **3 (kom)** is the main verb of the sentence and is the root.
- **4 (sporten)** or **(hobbyn)** is the subject of the sentence, but it is in an appositive structure where "sporten/hobbyn" is a clarification of the subject, with "hobbyn" being coordinated with "sporten". Therefore, we will treat "sporten" and "(hobbyn)" as two coordinated elements and put them in a Coord relation to **4 (sporten)**, and have them both point to the root of the sentence.
- **5 (under)** is a preposition (PP) and is dependent on **3 (kom)**.
- **6 (1700-talet)** is the object of the preposition and is dependent on **5 (under)**.
- **7 (och)** is a coordinating conjunction (CC) that connects the two clauses in the sentence and is dependent on **3 (kom)**.
- **8 (blev)** is the main verb of the second clause of the sentence and is dependent on **3 (kom)** via **7 (och)**.
- **9 (efter)** is a subordinating conjunction and is dependent on **8 (blev)**.
- **10 (ett)** is a determiner and is dependent on **11 (tag)**.
- **11 (tag)** is the object of the preposition and is dependent on **9 (efter)**.
- **12 (en)** is a determiner and is dependent on **13 (populär)**.
- **13 (populär)** is an adjective (MOD) that modifies **14 (söndagshobby)** and is dependent on **14 (söndagshobby)**.
- **14 (söndagshobby)** is the object of the sentence and is dependent on **8 (blev)**.

Given the above analysis, the final dependency tree is as follows:

* ('To the verb', 1, Till, 3)
* ('To the preposition', 2, Sverige, 1)
* ('Root', 3, kom, 0)
* ('Coord', 4, sporten, 3) 
* ('Coord', 5, hobbyn, 4)
* ('Under the verb', 6, under, 3)
* ('To the preposition', 7, 1700-talet, 6)
* ('Coordinated clause', 8, och, 3)
* ('Main verb of the clause', 9, blev, 8)
* ('Subordinate conjunction', 10, efter, 9)
* ('Determiner', 11, ett, 12)
* ('Object of the conjunction', 12, tag, 10)
* ('Determiner', 13, en, 14)
* ('Adjective', 14, populär, 15)
* ('Main object', 15, söndagshobby, 9)
 

However, depending on the accuracy desired and specificity in dependency classification,  this analysis may change.
