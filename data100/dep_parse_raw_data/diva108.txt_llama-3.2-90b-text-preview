To create a dependency parse tree of the provided Swedish sentence, we need to make a few assumptions. Firstly, let's determine the part-of-speech tags for each word. Secondly, let's assume that the sentence contains the following dependent relationships.

'rising costs of energy, combined with an increasing environmental consciousness on the part of building owners, render timely the law on certification of buildings for energy efficiency.'

Tokenized version:
1. Rising - PART (present participle/adjective)
2. costs - NOUN
3. of - PREP (of)
4. energy - NOUN
5. , - PUNCT (comma)
6. combined - VERB
7. with - PREP (with)
8. an - DET (a/an)
9. increasing - ADJ (increasing)
10. environmental - ADJ (environmental)
11. consciousness - NOUN
12. on - PREP (on)
13. the - DET (the)
14. part - NOUN
15. of - PREP (of)
16. building - NOUN
17. owners - NOUN
18. , - PUNCT (comma)
19. render - VERB
20. timely - ADV (timely)
21. the - DET (the)
22. law - NOUN
23. on - PREP (on)
24. certification - NOUN
25. of - PREP (of)
26. buildings - NOUN
27. for - PREP (for)
28. energy - NOUN
29. efficiency - NOUN
30. . - PUNCT (full stop)

Based on the tokens, dependency relationships can be inferred. It is crucial to remember that without context and knowledge of specific linguistic theory like Universal Dependencies (UD) in use, constructing a highly precise dependency tree would be harder.

Here is an analysis:
- costs depend on rising.
- energy depends on costs.
- combined depends on, (through punct) 
- consciousness depends on combined.
- environmental and increasing depend on (modifying) consciousness.
- the part and on depend on consciousness.
- of depends on (relation marking) the previous tokens 'part' and 'building owners'.
- of and building depend on owners.
- render depends on energy cost, owners (which is why punct now relation marking)
- timely depend on render
- the depends on (modification/det) law
- on and certification depend on law
- of depends on (relation marking) the certification
- for, energy and efficiency depend on buildings
- buildings depend on the law.

Below is a (manually computed) dependency tree:
[(1, Rising, 2), (2, costs, 4), (3, of, 4), (4, energy, 7),
 (5, , 7), (6, combined, 19), (7, with, 8), (8, , 6),
 (9, an, 11), (10, increasing, 11), (11, environmental, 11), 
 (12, consciousness, 6), (13, on, 14), (14, the, 16), 
 (15, part, 16), (16, of, 18), (17, building, 18), (18, owners, 19),
 (20, render, 2), (21, timely, 20), (22, the, 23), 
 (23, law, 19), (24, on, 26), (25, certification, 24), 
 (26, of, 28), (27, buildings, 25), (28, for, 29), 
 (29, buildings, 19), (20, , 29), (30, , 31)]

Hence dependency here stands for head-child relation.
