To analyze the provided Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we will break it down into its tokens, identify their relationships, and then assign indices accordingly. Here’s the dependency tree for the sentence:

```
[
    (1, Detta, 2),
    (2, är, 0),
    (3, bra, 2),
    (4, att, 5),
    (5, veta, 4),
    (6, så, 9),
    (7, att, 9),
    (8, man, 9),
    (9, står, 2),
    (10, där, 9),
    (11, med, 9),
    (12, exempelvis, 11),
    (13, en, 14),
    (14, scanner, 11),
    (15, som, 18),
    (16, man, 15),
    (17, köpt, 16),
    (18, kommer, 9),
    (19, på, 18),
    (20, att, 21),
    (21, moderkortet, 20),
    (22, inte, 21),
    (23, har, 21),
    (24, plats, 23),
    (25, för, 24),
    (26, flera, 24),
    (27, kort, 24),
    (28, som, 29),
    (29, vissa, 28),
    (30, scanners, 28),
    (31, kräver, 30),
    (32, ., 0),
    (33, och, 34),
    (34, kommer, 18)
]
```

In this tree:
- Each tuple represents a token.
- The first element is the token's index (starting from 1).
- The second element is the token itself.
- The third element is the index of the head token, where `0` indicates that the token is the root of the tree. 

This captures the syntactic dependencies in the sentence while treating punctuation and coordinating conjunction properly.
