To analyze the provided Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we will identify the tokens and their grammatical relations. Hereâ€™s the breakdown for the sentence: 

"Rising costs of energy, combined with an increasing environmental consciousness on the part of building owners, render timely the law on certification of buildings for energy efficiency."

The dependency tree representation would be:

```
[
    (1, Rising, 2), 
    (2, costs, 0), 
    (3, of, 2), 
    (4, energy, 3), 
    (5, combined, 6), 
    (6, with, 2), 
    (7, an, 8), 
    (8, increasing, 9), 
    (9, environmental, 10), 
    (10, consciousness, 6), 
    (11, on, 12), 
    (12, the, 13), 
    (13, part, 10), 
    (14, of, 13), 
    (15, building, 16), 
    (16, owners, 14), 
    (17, render, 2), 
    (18, timely, 17), 
    (19, the, 20), 
    (20, law, 17), 
    (21, on, 22), 
    (22, certification, 20), 
    (23, of, 22), 
    (24, buildings, 23), 
    (25, for, 26), 
    (26, energy, 24), 
    (27, efficiency, 26)
]
```

In this tree:
- Each tuple represents a token in the structure: (token index, token, head index).
- The head index for each token shows which token it is dependent on in the sentence structure.
- The root of the sentence (main verb) is indicated by a head index of 0, which is for "costs" in this case.
