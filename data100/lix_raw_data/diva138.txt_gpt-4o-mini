To compute the LIX (Lexical Readability Index) score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: A word is defined as any group of letters separated by spaces. The provided sentence has 24 words.

2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as words with 7 or more letters. In the sentence, we identify the long words:
   - "markeringen" (11 letters)
   - "betyder" (7 letters)
   - "problemen" (8 letters)
   - "miljöfaktorer" (13 letters)
   - "besvär" (6 letters) - but this is not counted as a long word.
   - "symtom" (6 letters) - also not counted.
   
   The long words are: "markeringen", "betyder", "problemen", and "miljöfaktorer", totaling 4 long words.

3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: A sentence is typically ended by a period, question mark, or exclamation mark. The provided text consists of 1 sentence.

4. **Calculate the LIX score using the formula**: 
   \[
   \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \frac{L \times 100}{W}
   \]

   Plugging in the numbers:
   \[
   W = 24, \quad S = 1, \quad L = 4
   \]
   \[
   \text{LIX} = \frac{24}{1} + \frac{4 \times 100}{24}
   \]
   \[
   \text{LIX} = 24 + \frac{400}{24} \approx 24 + 16.67 \approx 40.67
   \]

In conclusion, rounding the score to one decimal point gives:

LIX=40.7
