To compute the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)** in the text.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**, where a long word is defined as having more than 6 letters.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)** in the text.

The formula for calculating the LIX score is:

\[
\text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \frac{L \times 100}{W}
\]

Now, let's analyze the provided text:

**Text Analysis:**

1. **Word Count (W)**: 
   The provided text has 104 words.

2. **Long Word Count (L)**: 
   After examining the text, we identify the number of words longer than 6 letters:
   - Example words: kravst¨alla (11), designas (8), n¨odv¨andiga (10), garantera (9), applikationer (12), mellanvaror (11), realtidskrav (12), implementerats (12).
   Counting the long words gives us a total of **21 long words**.

3. **Sentence Count (S)**:
   The text consists of several clauses, but there are **3 main sentences** based on common punctuation and sentence structure.

Now, we can insert these counts into the formula:

- W = 104
- L = 21
- S = 3

Plugging the values into the LIX formula:

\[
\text{LIX} = \frac{104}{3} + \frac{21 \times 100}{104}
\]

Calculating each component:

- \(\frac{104}{3} \approx 34.67\)
- \(\frac{21 \times 100}{104} = \frac{2100}{104} \approx 20.19\)

Now we sum these values:

\[
\text{LIX} \approx 34.67 + 20.19 \approx 54.86
\]

Finally, rounding to the nearest whole number gives us the final LIX score.

Thus, the result is: 

LIX=55
