To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we use the formula:

**LIX = (number of words / number of sentences) + (number of long words * 100 / number of words)**

Where:
- A **long word** is defined as any word that contains more than 6 characters.
- A **sentence** is defined as any sequence of words ending in a period, exclamation mark, or question mark.

Let's analyze the text step-by-step:

### Step 1: Count the Words
Counting the total number of words in the text:
- Total words = 102

### Step 2: Count the Sentences
Counting the number of sentences in the text:
- Total sentences = 6

### Step 3: Count the Long Words
Now we identify the long words (more than 6 characters):
1. Medfödda (8)
2. beteenden (9)
3. typiska (8)
4. tveksam  (8)
5. nyckelretning (12)
6. djuret (6) (not counted, as it is not >6)
7. ”vattnas” (8)
8. normala (8)
9. bytesdjur (9)

Other words are either 6 characters or fewer or do not need to be counted as long.

Total long words = 7

### Step 4: Calculate the LIX
Now we can plug these counts into the LIX formula:

LIX = (number of words / number of sentences) + (number of long words * 100 / number of words)

Calculating:
- Number of words (W) = 102
- Number of sentences (S) = 6
- Number of long words (LW) = 7

LIX = (102 / 6) + (7 * 100 / 102)
LIX = 17 + (700 / 102)
LIX = 17 + 6.86
LIX ≈ 23.86

### Result
Finally, rounding to one decimal point gives us:

LIX = 23.9
