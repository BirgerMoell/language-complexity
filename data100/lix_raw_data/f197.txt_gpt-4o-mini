To compute the LIX readability score for the given Swedish text, I will follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: The text contains 19 words.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are those with 6 or more characters. The long words in the text are:
   - "oroade" (6)
   - "amerikanska" (12)
   - "säkerhetstjänsterna" (19)
   - "förbjöds" (8)
   - "brittiska" (9)
   - "kolonierna" (9)
   So, there are 6 long words.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: The text contains 2 sentences.

The LIX formula is:
\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \frac{L \times 100}{W} \]

Plugging in our values:
- \( W = 19 \)
- \( L = 6 \)
- \( S = 2 \)

Calculating each part:
- \( \frac{W}{S} = \frac{19}{2} = 9.5 \)
- \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} = \frac{6 \times 100}{19} \approx 31.58 \)

Now, adding these together:
\[ \text{LIX} = 9.5 + 31.58 \approx 41.08 \]

Finally, rounding to the nearest whole number gives:
LIX = 41

Thus, the final result is:
LIX=41
