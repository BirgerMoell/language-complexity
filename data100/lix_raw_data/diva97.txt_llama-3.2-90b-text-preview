To calculate the LIX readability score, we'll follow these steps:

1. Count the number of words in the text: 46
2. Count the number of sentences in the text: 3
3. Count the number of long words (with at least 6 characters) in the text: 16
4. Calculate the average number of words per sentence: 46 / 3 ≈ 15.33
5. Calculate the percentage of long words: 16 / 46 ≈ 0.348 (or 34.8%)

Now, we can plug these numbers into the LIX formula:

LIX = ( (n_words/sentences) + (long_words / n_words * 100) ) / 0.4

Where:
- n_words = 46
- sentences = 3
- long_words = 16

Substitute the values into the formula:

LIX = ( (46/3) + (16 / 46 * 100) ) / 0.4
LIX = ( 15.33 + 34.8 ) / 0.4
LIX = 50.13 / 0.4
LIX ≈ 125.325

So, LIX = 125.32
