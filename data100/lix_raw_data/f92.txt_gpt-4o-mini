To compute the LIX (Lesbarhetsindex) readability score from the provided Swedish text, we will follow the formula for LIX:

LIX = (A / O) + (K * 100 / E)

Where:
- A = the number of words
- O = the number of long words (words with more than 6 characters)
- K = the number of sentences
- E = the number of words per sentence (calculated as A / K)

**Step 1: Count the number of words (A)**
The text contains a total of 69 words.

**Step 2: Count the number of long words (O)**
The long words (more than 6 characters) in the text are:
1. kretsar (7)
2. moderkortet (10)
3. ingångar (8)
4. utgångar (8)
5. tangentbord (10)
6. processorn (8)
7. RAM-minnet (9)
8. utrustningen (11)

Total long words (O) = 8

**Step 3: Count the number of sentences (K)**
The text has 4 sentences.

**Step 4: Calculate E (the average number of words per sentence)**
E = A / K = 69 / 4 = 17.25

**Step 5: Now plug the values into the LIX formula**
LIX = (A / O) + (K * 100 / E)

Substituting the values:
- A = 69
- O = 8
- K = 4
- E = 17.25

LIX = (69 / 8) + (4 * 100 / 17.25)
LIX = 8.625 + (400 / 17.25)
LIX = 8.625 + 23.19 ≈ 31.815

**Result:**
LIX = 31.82 (rounded to two decimal places)

Final output:
LIX=31.82
