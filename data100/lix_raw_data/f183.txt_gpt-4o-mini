To calculate the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score, we need to use the formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{(S / SOrd) + \frac{(L * 100)}{SOrd}} \]

Where:
- \( S \) is the number of words in the text.
- \( SOrd \) is the number of sentences in the text.
- \( L \) is the number of long words (words with more than 6 letters).

Now, let's analyze the provided text.

1. **Count the words (S)**:
   The text has 127 words.

2. **Count the sentences (SOrd)**:
   The text contains 5 sentences.

3. **Count the long words (L)**:
   The long words are:
   - "ekvatorn" (8 letters)
   - "glaciärer" (9 letters)
   - "rullstensåsar" (13 letters)
   - "fördelat" (8 letters)
   - "tropiska" (8 letters)
   - "subtropiska" (11 letters)
   - "varierat" (8 letters)
   - "regnar" (6 letters) - not counted since it has 6 letters
   - "månad" (5 letters) - not counted
   - "snitt" (5 letters) - not counted
   - Total long words (L) = 7

Now we can plug in the values into the LIX formula:

\[ 
\text{LIX} = \frac{(127 / 5) + \frac{(7 * 100)}{127}} 
= \frac{(25.4) + \frac{700}{127}} 
= \frac{(25.4) + 5.51} 
= 30.91 
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get a final score:

LIX = 31
