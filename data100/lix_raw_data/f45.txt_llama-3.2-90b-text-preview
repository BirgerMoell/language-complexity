To calculate the LIX readability score, I will follow these steps:

1. Count the number of words in the text. 
   There are 96 words.

2. Count the number of sentences in the text. 
   There are 5 sentences.

3. Count the number of long words (words with 7 or more letters) in the text. 
   There are 13 long words: osäker, smittad, virus, karantän, nätverkssladdar, kommunikationsenheter, sorters, filvirus, programfil, ofta, enheter, genast, infekterade.

4. Calculate the average word length in letters. 
   However, since we are calculating LIX, we don't need the exact average word length. Instead, we need to calculate the percentage of long words.

Percentage of long words = (Number of long words / Number of words) * 100 
= (13 / 96) * 100 
= 13.54 

5. Calculate the average sentence length in words. 
   Average sentence length = (Number of words / Number of sentences) * 100 / 100
   = (96 / 5) 
   = 19.2 

6. Now we can use the LIX formula:
   LIX = Average sentence length * (percentage of long words / 100) + percentage of long words
   = 19.2 * (13.54 / 100) + 13.54 
   = 2.6 + 13.54 
   = 16.14

Rounding to two decimal places, we get:

LIX = 16.14
