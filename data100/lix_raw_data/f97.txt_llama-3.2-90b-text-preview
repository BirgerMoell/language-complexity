To calculate the LIX readability score, we will use the following formula:

LIX = (A + B) x 100 / C

Where:

* A is the average number of letters per word.
* B is the average number of words per sentence.
* C is 100.

Here's the calculation:

1. First, we need to calculate the average number of letters per word (A).
The text contains 96 words, with a total of 526 letters.
However, some letters from abbreviations like "Hz" and "" must be excluded. 
Assuming 8-10 abbreviations in the whole text, removing about 10 letters ( " och några decimal tecken är 6-8), we have 518-516 letters left.
Now we can calculate A: 518-516 letters / 96 words, and assume: 5.35- 5.37 avg letters/word (use value 5.36)

2. Next, we need to calculate the average number of words per sentence (B).
The text contains 6 sentences with a total of 96 words.
Now we can calculate B: 96 words / 6 sentences = 16 words per sentence.

3. Now we can plug in the values to calculate the LIX score:

LIX = (5.36 + 16) x 100 / 100
LIX = 21.36 x 1
LIX = 21.36
 Result must be rounded-off to one decimal place : LIX ≈ 21.4
