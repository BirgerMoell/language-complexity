To calculate the LIX readability score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Count the total number of words (W) in the text.
2. Count the number of long words (LW), which are words with 6 or more letters.
3. Count the total number of sentences (S) in the text.
4. Calculate the average sentence length (ASL) by dividing the total number of words by the total number of sentences.
5. Calculate the percentage of long words (LWP) by dividing the number of long words by the total number of words.

The LIX readability score is then calculated using the following formula:

LIX = (ASL + LWP * 100) * 0.4

Here are the calculations:

1. Total number of words (W) = 46 (counted manually)
2. Number of long words (LW) = 22 (counted manually)
   Some examples of long words are: energideklarationerna, relativt, tidskrävande, utförliga, lönsamma.
3. Total number of sentences (S) = 3 (counted manually)
4. Average sentence length (ASL) = 46 / 3 = 15.33 words per sentence
5. Percentage of long words (LWP) = 22 / 46 * 100 = 47.83%

Now, let's plug in the numbers into the formula:

LIX = ((15.33 + 47.83) * 0.4) 
LIX ≈ 25.35 * 0.4 
LIX ≈ 10.14 

Since LIX scores should be rounded to nearest 0.1, our LIX result would be approximately 10.1.

LIX=10.1
