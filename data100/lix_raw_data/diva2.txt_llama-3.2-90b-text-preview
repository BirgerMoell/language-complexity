To compute the LIX readability score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Count the number of words in the text. 
   There are 46 words in the provided Swedish text.

2. Count the number of sentences in the text (indicated by a full stop). 
   There are 3 sentences in the provided Swedish text.

3. Count the number of long words in the text (words with more than 6 letters). 
   There are 23 long words in the provided Swedish text.

Next, we'll use the LIX formula to calculate the readability score:
LIX = ((number of long words / total number of words) * 100) + (number of words / number of sentences)

Let's do the math:

- (number of long words / total number of words) = 23 / 46 = 0.5
- Multiply the result by 100: 0.5 * 100 = 50
- (number of words / number of sentences) = 46 / 3 = 15.33
- Add the results together: 50 + 15.33 = 65.33

So, the LIX readability score for the given Swedish text is:

LIX=65.33
