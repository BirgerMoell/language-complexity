To calculate the LIX readability score, we'll follow these steps:

1. Count the number of words in the text: 46 words.
2. Count the number of long words (with 6 or more letters) in the text: 19 words.
3. Count the number of sentences in the text: 5 sentences.
4. Calculate the average sentence length by dividing the total number of words by the number of sentences: 46 / 5 = 9.2
5. Calculate the average number of long words per sentence by dividing the number of long words by the number of sentences: 19 / 5 = 3.8

Now, we'll apply the LIX formula:

LIX = (sentences / words) × 100 + (long words / words) × 100
However, this is a simplified explanation. A more accurate interpretation of the LIX score and the most common used LIX calculation method in, for example, the Swedish Readability Formula for LIX uses the following formula:

LIX = (Average sentence length + (Number of long words / 100 × Average sentence length) × (Average sentence length / 5) × 100) / (Average sentence length / 5)

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

LIX = (9.2 + (3.8/100 × 46)) 
     = 9.2 + ((3.8 × 46) / 100)
     = 9.2 + 1.748 = 10.948 OR we use the recommended further calculation to isolate the last 2 components to determine the final 'calculated long word amount', that is in the 5 mentioned other specific case.


LIX = (9.2 + (3.8 × 9.2) / 5)  = (9.2) +  7.024 = 16.224
