To calculate the LIX readability score, we'll use the LIX formula, which is primarily used for Swedish texts:

LIX = (W average + S average + P average) * 100 / W average

First, let's define the variables:
- W average (Average number of words)
- S average (Average number of sentences)
- P average (Percentage of long words)

We'll calculate these values for the given text:

1. W average: Divide the total number of words by the total number of sentences.
- Total number of words = 69
- Total number of sentences = 4
- W average = 69 / 4 = 17.25

2. S average: Divide the total number of sentences by the total number of paragraphs. Since the text is given as a single block of text, there's only 1 paragraph,
- Total number of sentences = 4
- Total number of paragraphs = 1
- S average = 4 / 1 = 4

3. P average: Divide the number of words with 4 or more syllables (or that are at least 6 chars long in this context) and not part of common Swedish list of short words (there are about 140 common Swedish short words) by the total number of words.
- Number of words with 4 or more syllables or at least 6 chars long = 16 ( words are "production", "divisions", "analysed", "bottlenecks", "studied", "solid", "concrete", "beams", "solid", "walls", "identify", "cycle", "content", "workstations", "earlier", "identified", "bottlenecks" and we ignore short words like solid). Considering words that do not belong to Swedish common short list (in this case), there are 8
- Total number of words = 69
- P average = 8 / 69 * 100 = 11.59


Now, we can compute the LIX score:

LIX = (17.25 + 4 + 11.59) * 100 / 17.25
LIX = (32.84) * 100 / 17.25
LIX â‰ˆ 45.91

The result rounded to two decimal places:
LIX = 45.91
