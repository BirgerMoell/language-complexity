To compute the LIX readability score, we use the following formula:

**LIX = (number of words / number of sentences) + (number of long words * 100 / number of words)**

Where:
- Long words are defined as words that have more than 6 characters.
- A sentence is typically defined by the presence of a full stop, exclamation mark, or question mark.

Let's analyze the given Swedish text step by step:

1. **Count the number of words:** 
   The text consists of 99 words.

2. **Count the number of sentences:** 
   The text is composed of 5 sentences (indicated by the full stops).

3. **Count the number of long words:** 
   The long words are:
   - Hårdvara
   - hardware
   - samlingsnamn
   - utrustningen
   - skrivare
   - bildskärm
   - CD-ROM
   - Compact (when counted)
   - Disc
   - Memory
   - Innehållet
   - skiva
   - Megabyte
   - dator
   - enhet
   - datorer
   - nuförtiden
   - spel
   - program
   - Internet
   - bibliotek
   - massor
   - information
   - utspritt
   - hemsidor
   - hemsidor

   Total: 25 long words.

Now we can input these values into the LIX formula:

- Number of words = 99
- Number of sentences = 5
- Number of long words = 25

Plugging into the formula:

LIX = (99 / 5) + (25 * 100 / 99)

Calculating it step-by-step:

1. Number of words / Number of sentences = 99 / 5 = 19.8
2. Number of long words * 100 / Number of words = (25 * 100) / 99 = 25.25

Now adding these two results:

LIX = 19.8 + 25.25 = 45.05

Finally, rounding to two decimal points, we get:

LIX = 45.05

The final result is:

LIX=45.05
