To compute the LIX (Lesbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: 
   The text contains 53 words.

2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: 
   Long words are defined as words with more than 6 characters. After analyzing the text, we find that there are 22 long words.

3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**:
   The text comprises 2 sentences.

Now, we use the LIX formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \frac{L \times 100}{W} \]

Plugging in the values:

- \( W = 53 \)
- \( L = 22 \)
- \( S = 2 \)

Now, we compute:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{53}{2} + \frac{22 \times 100}{53} \]

Calculating each part:

- First term: \( \frac{53}{2} = 26.5 \)
- Second term: \( \frac{22 \times 100}{53} = \frac{2200}{53} \approx 41.51 \)

Now, adding them together:

\[ \text{LIX} \approx 26.5 + 41.51 \approx 68.01 \]

So, the final calculated LIX score is approximately 68.

Therefore, the result is:

LIX=68
