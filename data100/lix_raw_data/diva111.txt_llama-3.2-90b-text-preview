To compute the LIX readability score, we need to analyze the text according to the following parameters:

1. The percentage of words with more than six letters (complex words).
2. The average number of words per sentence.
3. The average number of letters per word.

However, the given Swedish text seems to be a collection of keywords rather than a coherent text. We will have to assume a certain degree of cohesion to our advantage for the purposes of readability scoring.

The given text 'Keywords: initial study, object description, measures, climate shell, caution, energy, moisture,  “pay-back times”' has 9 words. Let us break down the words longer than six letters: 'initial', 'object', 'description', 'climate', 'caution', 'moisture', and '“pay-back' can also be considered longer in terms of the amount of information per word but can be 'times'.

Out of 9 words, 7 words have more than six letters. That gives us (7 / 9) * 100 = 77.8% of complex words.

For the average number of words per sentence and the average number of letters per word, we can merge the keywords into one hypothetical sentence, then continue from there: 'Initial study of object description measures climate shell, including caution for energy and moisture in determining pay-back times.'

Then let's reformulate the sentence as: 'Initial study – the object description measures the climate shell including caution for energy and moisture with payback times.'

It consists of 1 sentence, for the purpose of a coherent text with 24 words (from the reformulated longer sentence). 

Now, for the calculation, we consider there is one (1) sentence. Furthermore, based on words calculated from the reformulated coherent longer sentence, there are 24 words / 1 sentence = 24 words per sentence.

Let’s calculate the average number of letters per word:
Word count = 24 words
Total number of letters = [Initial(7) + study(5) + the(3) + object(6) + description(11) + measures(7) + the(3) + climate(7) + shell(5) + including(9) + caution(7) + for(3) + energy(6) + and(3) + moisture(8) + with(4) + payback(7) + times(5)] = 99
The average number of letters per word is (Total number of letters / word count) 99 / 24 = 4.125 letters per word.

LIX is calculated using the following formula:
LIX = (words per sentence * average letters per word * 100) / (5 * (percentage of six-letter words) + (word-length).

Final input calculations will give:
LIX = (24 * 4.125 * 100) / (5 * (7.778) + 4.125)
= 2082.375 / 40.755
≈ 51.

Therefore, for the purposes of readability scores in this particular given example, where some allowances are made for this being more text based on items found on a database with possibly extraneous comma or period as the text separation method used:
 
LIX = 51
