To compute the LIX ( LÃ¤sbarhetsindex, or Readability Index) score for the provided Swedish text, we will follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: The total number of words in the text.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as words with more than 6 characters.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: The total number of sentences in the text.

The LIX formula is given by:

\[
\text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \frac{L \times 100}{W}
\]

### Step 1: Count the words (W)
The provided text contains **78 words**.

### Step 2: Count the long words (L)
By counting the words with more than 6 characters in the text, we find there are **22 long words**.

### Step 3: Count the sentences (S)
There are **3 sentences** in the text.

### Now we can apply the LIX formula:
- **W (total words)** = 78
- **L (long words)** = 22
- **S (total sentences)** = 3

Plugging these values into the LIX formula:

\[
\text{LIX} = \frac{78}{3} + \frac{22 \times 100}{78}
\]

Calculating each part:

1. \(\frac{78}{3} = 26\)
2. \(\frac{22 \times 100}{78} \approx 28.21\)

Now combine these:

\[
\text{LIX} = 26 + 28.21 \approx 54.21
\]

### Final result:
LIX=54.21
