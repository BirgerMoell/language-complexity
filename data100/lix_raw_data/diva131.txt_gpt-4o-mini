To compute the LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we will follow the LIX formula, which is given by:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{S}{A} + \left( \frac{N \times 100}{S} \right) \]

Where:
- \( S \) = number of words in the text
- \( A \) = number of long words (words with more than 6 characters)
- \( N \) = number of sentences in the text

Now, let's analyze the text:

1. **Count the Words (S)**: The text contains 102 words.
2. **Count the Sentences (N)**: The text contains 5 sentences.
3. **Count the Long Words (A)**: The long words in this text are:
   - "different"
   - "production"
   - "studied"
   - "consisted"
   - "bottlenecks"
   - "analysed"
   - "sampling"
   - "observed"
   
   This gives us a total of 8 long words.

Now we can plug these values into the LIX formula:

- \( S = 102 \)
- \( N = 5 \)
- \( A = 8 \)

Calculating LIX:

1. Calculate \( \frac{S}{A} = \frac{102}{8} = 12.75 \)
2. Calculate \( \frac{N \times 100}{S} = \frac{5 \times 100}{102} \approx 4.90 \)
3. Now, sum these two results for LIX:

\[ \text{LIX} = 12.75 + 4.90 \approx 17.65 \]

Therefore, the final LIX readability score for the text is:

LIX=17.65
