To compute the LIX readability score, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of characters (C)** in the text (including spaces and punctuation).
2. **Count the number of words (W)** in the text.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)** in the text.

For the provided Swedish text:

1. **Characters (C)**: The text contains 563 characters.
2. **Words (W)**: The text contains 101 words.
3. **Sentences (S)**: The text contains 5 sentences.

Now we can calculate the LIX score using the formula:

\[ LIX = \frac{C}{W} + \frac{W}{S} \]

Substituting the counts:

- C = 563
- W = 101
- S = 5

Calculation:

1. Calculate \( \frac{C}{W} \):
   \[
   \frac{563}{101} \approx 5.57
   \]

2. Calculate \( \frac{W}{S} \):
   \[
   \frac{101}{5} = 20.2
   \]

3. Combine the results:
   \[
   LIX = 5.57 + 20.2 \approx 25.77
   \]

Finally, rounding the score:

LIX = 26

Thus, the LIX readability score for the provided text is:

LIX=26
