To calculate the LIX readability score, we'll use the following formula: 

LIX = (Words/sentences) + (average number of syllables per word) * 100/ average number of words per sentence.

First, we need to split the text into words and sentences. The text is originally in English, so not Swedish, however it contains Swedish-like names which makes this task slightly tolerable. 

1. Words: 
- We
- enjoyed
- exposure
- to
- numerous
- articulate
- people
- within
- the
- company
- Special
- acknowledgements
- are
- directed
- towards
- Cecilia
- Jan
- Joakim
- Niklas
- and
- Susanne
- for
- their
- great
- support
- when
- comprehending
- the
- particular
- problem
- we
- solved
- together.

Total words = 29.

2. Sentences:
- We enjoyed exposure to numerous articulate people within the company.
- Special acknowledgements are directed towards Cecilia, Jan, Joakim, Niklas and Susanne for their great support when comprehending the particular problem we solved together.

Total sentences = 2.

Now let's break down the words into syllables. 

1. We (1)
2. enjoyed (2)
3. exposure (3)
4. to (1)
5. numerous (3)
6. articulate (4)
7. people (2)
8. within (2)
9. the (1)
10. company (3)
11. Special (2)
12. acknowledgements (4)
13. are (1)
14. directed (3)
15. towards (2)
16. Cecilia (3)
17. Jan (1)
18. Joakim (2)
19. Niklas (2)
20. and (1)
21. Susanne (2)
22. for (1)
23. their (1)
24. great (1)
25. support (2)
26. when (1)
27. comprehending (4)
28. the (1)
29. particular (4)
30. problem (2)
31. we (1)
32. solved (1)
33. together (3)

Total words = 33.

Total syllables = 67.

Average syllables per word = Total syllables / Total words
Average syllables per word = 67 / 33
Average syllables per word ≈ 2.03

Average number of words per sentence = Total words / Total sentences 
Average number of words per sentence = 33 / 2 
Average number of words per sentence = 16.5

Now calculate the LIX:
LIX = (average number of words per sentence) + (average number of syllables per word) * 100/ average number of words per sentence
LIX ≈ 16.5 + (2.03 * 100) / 16.5
 LIX ≈ 16.5 + 12.36
 LIX ≈ 28.86.


LIX = 28.86
