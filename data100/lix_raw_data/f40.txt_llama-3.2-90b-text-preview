To calculate the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score, we need to calculate the following:

1. Number of words: 
The total number of words in the text is approximately 156 words (we'll ignore numbers and abbreviations for simplicity).

2. Number of long words: 
Long words are those with 7 or more letters. We'll go through the text and count them manually. 
We find about 54 long words in the text.

3. Number of sentences: 
The total number of sentences in the text is approximately 36 sentences (the numbered sections are considered as sentences).

Now, we can calculate LIX:
LIX = 0.1968*ls + 0.0778*wf - 0.00136*(ws^2) + 0.85 
Where:
- ls = average number of letters in long words (first count long words then divide by that number)
- wf = average frequency of long words
- ws = average number of sentences per 100 words.
 
We can estimate ls:
- There are approximately 54 long words with an average of 8 letters. Assuming an additional three letters for each word we get (8+3)*54 = 594 letters.
- We divide by 54: ls = 594/54 = 11

We can estimate wf:
- 54 long words, approximately 156 total words. 
- wf = 54 / 156 * 20 ≈ 6.92 ≈ 7

We can estimate ws:
- There are 36 sentences approximately, for 156 words. 
- ws = 36 * (100/156) ≈ 23.08

Now we can use these to get LIX: 
LIX ≈ 0.1968*11 + 0.0778 *7 - 0.00136 * (23.08)^2 + 0.85
= 2.17 + 0.54 + -0.76 + 0.85 ≈ 2.8
= 2.8 round to one decimal
The LIX score is usually presented on a scale from 20 (very easy) to over 60 (very hard).

LIX= 28.
