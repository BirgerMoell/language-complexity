To compute the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: Words are counted as separations based on spaces; in this text, there are 93 words.

2. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: Sentences are typically marked by punctuation marks such as periods. In this text, there are 4 sentences.

3. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as words that have more than 6 characters. In this text, we identify the long words and count them. The long words are:
   - Mäklarbranschens (17)
   - försämrades (12)
   - motverka (8)
   - bildades (8)
   - fastighetsmäklare (17)
   - olika (6)
   - mäklarföretag (14)
   - Stockholms (10)
   - innerstad (8)
   - istället (8)
   - utgångspris (11)
   - infördes (7)
   - accepterat (9)
   - innebär (7)
   - annonseras (10)
   - tänka (6)
   - sälja (6)
   - bostaden (8)
   - priset (6)

   After counting, we find there are 15 words longer than 6 characters.

4. **Apply the LIX formula**: 
   \[
   \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \frac{L \times 100}{W}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   - \(W = 93\)
   - \(S = 4\)
   - \(L = 15\)

   Now we compute:
   \[
   \text{LIX} = \frac{93}{4} + \frac{15 \times 100}{93}
   \]
   \[
   \text{LIX} = 23.25 + \frac{1500}{93} \approx 23.25 + 16.13 \approx 39.38
   \]

5. **Round to a suitable number**: It is common to round the LIX score to the nearest whole number for clarity.
   Thus, LIX ≈ 39.

Finally, the readability score is reported as:
LIX=39
