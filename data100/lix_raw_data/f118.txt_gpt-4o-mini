To compute the LIX (Legibility Index) readability score of the provided Swedish text, we will need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (N)** in the text.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**, which are defined as words with more than 6 letters.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)** in the text.

The formula for LIX is as follows:

\[
LIX = \frac{N}{S} + \frac{L \cdot 100}{N}
\]

Let's analyze the text step-by-step.

### Step 1: Count the words (N)
The given text contains 114 words.

### Step 2: Count the long words (L)
We go through the text and count the words with more than 6 letters:

- Hårdvara
- samlingsnamn
- utrustningen
- skrivare
- bildskärm
- Compact
- Memory
- Innehållet
- många
- dator
- enhet
- flesta
- nuförtiden
- skiva
- information
- utspritt
- hemsidor
- massor

From the count, there are 17 long words.

### Step 3: Count the sentences (S)
The text has 7 sentences, determined by the periods and other punctuation.

### Step 4: Calculate LIX
Now we can substitute the values into the LIX formula:

- N = 114
- L = 17
- S = 7

Calculating the LIX:

\[
LIX = \frac{114}{7} + \frac{17 \cdot 100}{114}
\]

Calculating each part:

1. \(\frac{114}{7} \approx 16.29\)
2. \(\frac{17 \cdot 100}{114} \approx 14.91\)

Adding these together:

\[
LIX \approx 16.29 + 14.91 = 31.20
\]

Finally, we can express the result as follows:

LIX=31.20
