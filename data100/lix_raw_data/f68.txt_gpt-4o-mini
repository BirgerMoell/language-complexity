To calculate the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: A word is defined as any sequence of characters that is not a space. The provided text contains 99 words.

2. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: A sentence is defined as any sequence of words that ends with a period, exclamation mark, or question mark. In the text, we can identify 5 sentences.

3. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are those with more than 6 characters. After analyzing the text, the number of long words in the text is 14.

Now that we have these counts:
- W = 99 (total words)
- S = 5 (total sentences)
- L = 14 (long words)

We can apply the LIX formula:
\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \left( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \right) \]

Plugging the values into the formula:
1. Calculate \( W/S \): 
   \[ \frac{99}{5} = 19.8 \]

2. Calculate \( (L \times 100) / W \):
   \[ \frac{14 \times 100}{99} \approx 14.14 \]

3. Now, sum these two results:
   \[ 19.8 + 14.14 \approx 33.94 \]

Rounding this to a more usable form, we then get the final LIX score.

Thus, the final result is:
LIX=34
