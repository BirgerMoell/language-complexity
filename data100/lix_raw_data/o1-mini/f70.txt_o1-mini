To calculate the **LIX** (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, I followed these steps:

### 1. **Counting Words**
The total number of words in the text is **91**.

### 2. **Counting Sentences**
The text contains **5** sentences. Sentence boundaries are identified by periods (`.`), question marks (`?`), and exclamation marks (`!`). Special attention was given to periods in abbreviations (e.g., "pga.", "tex.") to avoid miscounting.

### 3. **Counting Long Words**
Long words are defined as words with **more than 6 letters**. There are **15** such words in the text.

### 4. **Applying the LIX Formula**
The LIX formula is:

\[
\text{LIX} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Words}}{\text{Total Sentences}} \right) + \left( \frac{\text{Long Words} \times 100}{\text{Total Words}} \right)
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
\text{LIX} = \left( \frac{91}{5} \right) + \left( \frac{15 \times 100}{91} \right) = 18.2 + 16.48 = 34.68
\]

Rounding up, the LIX score is **35**.

**Result:**
```
LIX=35
