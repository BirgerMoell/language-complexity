To calculate the **LIX** (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided text, we'll follow these steps:

### 1. **Count the Number of Words**
First, we count all the words in the text.

**Total Words:** 60

### 2. **Count the Number of Sentences**
Next, we determine the number of sentences. Each period (`.`) typically signifies the end of a sentence.

**Total Sentences:** 3

### 3. **Identify Long Words**
In LIX calculation, *long words* are those with more than 6 letters. Let's identify them:

- **First Sentence:** studying, exchange, student, Seattle (4 long words)
- **Second Sentence:** currently, growing, densifying, buildings, existing, environments (6 long words)
- **Third Sentence:** majority, creating, contrasts, environment (4 long words)

**Total Long Words:** 14

### 4. **Apply the LIX Formula**
The LIX formula is:

\[
\text{LIX} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Words}}{\text{Number of Sentences}} \right) + \left( \frac{\text{Number of Long Words} \times 100}{\text{Number of Words}} \right)
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
\text{LIX} = \left( \frac{60}{3} \right) + \left( \frac{14 \times 100}{60} \right) = 20 + 23.33 = 43.33
\]

### **Final Result**

**LIX=43**
