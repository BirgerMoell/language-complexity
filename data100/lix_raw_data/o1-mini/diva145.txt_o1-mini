To compute the **LIX (Lesbarhetsindex)** readability score for the provided text, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Count the total number of words.**
2. **Count the total number of sentences.**
3. **Count the number of long words** (words longer than 6 letters).
4. **Apply the LIX formula:**

   \[
   \text{LIX} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Words}}{\text{Total Sentences}} \right) + \left( \frac{\text{Long Words} \times 100}{\text{Total Words}} \right)
   \]

Let's analyze the text step-by-step.

### **Given Text:**
"The measurements to be performed in the attics were air temperature, relative humidity, moisture ratio and air change rate. Since the climate in the attics is dependent on the outdoor climate, it was decided that outdoor climate data would be collected as well. Moisture ratios of similar points in the different objects were measured in order to estimate the cause of these differences."

### **1. Counting Total Words:**

Let's break down each sentence:

1. **First Sentence:**
   ```
   The measurements to be performed in the attics were air temperature, relative humidity, moisture ratio and air change rate.
   ```
   - **Word Count:** 19

2. **Second Sentence:**
   ```
   Since the climate in the attics is dependent on the outdoor climate, it was decided that outdoor climate data would be collected as well.
   ```
   - **Word Count:** 23

3. **Third Sentence:**
   ```
   Moisture ratios of similar points in the different objects were measured in order to estimate the cause of these differences.
   ```
   - **Word Count:** 20

**Total Words = 19 + 23 + 20 = 62**

---

### **2. Counting Total Sentences:**

There are **3 sentences** in the provided text.

---

### **3. Counting Long Words (Longer than 6 letters):**

We'll identify words with more than 6 letters in each sentence.

1. **First Sentence:**
   - **Long Words:** measurements, performed, temperature, relative, humidity, moisture
   - **Count:** 6

2. **Second Sentence:**
   - **Long Words:** climate, dependent, outdoor, climate, decided, outdoor, climate, collected
   - **Count:** 8

3. **Third Sentence:**
   - **Long Words:** Moisture, similar, different, objects, measured, estimate, differences
   - **Count:** 7

**Total Long Words = 6 + 8 + 7 = 21**

---

### **4. Applying the LIX Formula:**

\[
\text{LIX} = \left( \frac{62}{3} \right) + \left( \frac{21 \times 100}{62} \right) \approx 20.67 + 33.87 = 54.54
\]

**Rounding off, LIX â‰ˆ 55**

---

**LIX=55**
