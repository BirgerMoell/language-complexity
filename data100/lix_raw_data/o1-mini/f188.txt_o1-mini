To calculate the **LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex)** readability score for the provided Swedish text, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Count the Total Number of Words
First, we count all the words in the text.

**Total Words:** 70

### Step 2: Count the Total Number of Sentences
Next, we identify and count all the sentences. Sentences are typically separated by periods, question marks, or exclamation marks.

**Total Sentences:** 8

### Step 3: Count the Number of Long Words
A **long word** is defined as a word with more than 6 letters. We count all such words in the text.

**Long Words Count:** 25

### Step 4: Apply the LIX Formula
The LIX formula is:

\[ \text{LIX} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Words}}{\text{Number of Sentences}} \right) + \left( \frac{\text{Number of Long Words} \times 100}{\text{Number of Words}} \right) \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ \text{LIX} = \left( \frac{70}{8} \right) + \left( \frac{25 \times 100}{70} \right) \]
\[ \text{LIX} = 8.75 + 35.71 \]
\[ \text{LIX} \approx 44.46 \]

Rounded to the nearest whole number:

**LIX = 44**
