To compute the **LIX (Läsbarhetsindex)** readability score for the provided text, we'll follow these steps:

### **1. Understand the LIX Formula**
The LIX formula is calculated as:

\[ \text{LIX} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Words}}{\text{Number of Sentences}} \right) + \left( \frac{\text{Number of Long Words} \times 100}{\text{Number of Words}} \right) \]

- **Words**: Total number of words in the text.
- **Sentences**: Total number of sentences.
- **Long Words**: Words with more than 6 letters.

### **2. Analyze the Text**

**Given Text:**
```
The empirical investigation is primary based upon qualitative interviews with public officials in seven Swedish municipalities. The study concludes in that ‘a sense of place’ as defined within the study, is highly relevant and present in Swedish municipal planning practice.
```

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

1. **Count the Sentences:**
   - There are **2 sentences** in the text.

2. **Count the Words:**
   - **First Sentence:** 16 words
   - **Second Sentence:** 24 words
   - **Total Words:** 16 + 24 = **40 words**

3. **Identify Long Words (more than 6 letters):**
   - **First Sentence Long Words:** empirical, investigation, primary, qualitative, interviews, officials, Swedish, municipalities (8 words)
   - **Second Sentence Long Words:** concludes, defined, relevant, present, Swedish, municipal, planning, practice (8 words)
   - **Total Long Words:** 8 + 8 = **16 words**

### **3. Apply the LIX Formula**

\[ \text{LIX} = \left( \frac{40}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{16 \times 100}{40} \right) \]

\[ \text{LIX} = 20 + 40 \]

\[ \text{LIX} = 60 \]

### **Result**

**LIX=60**
