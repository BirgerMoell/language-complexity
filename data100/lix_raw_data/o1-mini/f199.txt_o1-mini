To compute the LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, I followed these steps:

### **1. Count the Number of Words**
First, I counted all the words in the text. The total number of words is **87**.

### **2. Count the Number of Sentences**
Next, I identified the number of sentences by counting the periods (`.`) which typically denote the end of a sentence in Swedish. There are **5** sentences in the text.

### **3. Count the Number of Long Words**
A "long word" in the LIX formula is defined as a word with more than 6 letters. I identified **19** such long words in the text.

### **4. Apply the LIX Formula**
The LIX formula is:

\[
\text{LIX} = \left(\frac{\text{Number of Words}}{\text{Number of Sentences}}\right) + \left(\frac{\text{Number of Long Words} \times 100}{\text{Number of Words}}\right)
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
\text{LIX} = \left(\frac{87}{5}\right) + \left(\frac{19 \times 100}{87}\right) = 17.4 + 21.839 \approx 39.24
\]

### **Result**
**LIX=39.2**
