To calculate the **LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex)** readability score for the provided Swedish text, we'll follow these steps:

### **1. Count the Number of Words**
First, we identify and count all the words in the text. Words are typically separated by spaces.

**Total Words:** 60

### **2. Count the Number of Sentences**
Next, we determine the number of sentences. Sentences are usually ended by punctuation marks like periods (`.`) and question marks (`?`).

**Total Sentences:** 7

### **3. Count the Number of Long Words**
In LIX calculation, a long word is defined as a word with more than 6 letters. We identify and count these words.

**Long Words (>6 letters):** 22

### **4. Apply the LIX Formula**
The LIX formula is:

\[
\text{LIX} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Words}}{\text{Number of Sentences}} \right) + \left( \frac{\text{Number of Long Words}}{\text{Number of Words}} \times 100 \right)
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
\text{LIX} = \left( \frac{60}{7} \right) + \left( \frac{22}{60} \times 100 \right) \approx 8.57 + 36.67 \approx 45.24
\]

### **5. Final LIX Score**
Rounding to the nearest whole number:

**LIX = 45**
