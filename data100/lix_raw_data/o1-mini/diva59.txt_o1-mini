To calculate the **LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex)** readability score for the provided text, we'll follow these steps:

### **1. Count the Number of Words**
First, let's count all the words in the text.

**Text:**
```
We enjoyed exposure to numerous articulate people within the company. Special acknowledgements are directed towards Cecilia, Jan, Joakim, Niklas and Susanne for their great support when comprehending the particular problem we solved together.
```

- **Sentence 1:** 10 words
- **Sentence 2:** 23 words
- **Total Words:** 10 + 23 = **33 words**

### **2. Count the Number of Sentences**
The text consists of:
- **Sentence 1:** "We enjoyed exposure to numerous articulate people within the company."
- **Sentence 2:** "Special acknowledgements are directed towards Cecilia, Jan, Joakim, Niklas and Susanne for their great support when comprehending the particular problem we solved together."

- **Total Sentences:** **2**

### **3. Count the Number of Long Words**
Long words are defined as words with more than 6 letters.

**Identified Long Words:**

- **Sentence 1:**
  - enjoyed
  - exposure
  - numerous
  - articulate
  - company

- **Sentence 2:**
  - Special
  - acknowledgements
  - directed
  - towards
  - Cecilia
  - Susanne
  - support
  - comprehending
  - particular
  - problem
  - together

- **Total Long Words:** **16**

### **4. Apply the LIX Formula**
The LIX formula is:
\[
\text{LIX} = \left(\frac{\text{Number of Words}}{\text{Number of Sentences}}\right) + \left(\frac{\text{Number of Long Words} \times 100}{\text{Number of Words}}\right)
\]

Plugging in the numbers:
\[
\text{LIX} = \left(\frac{33}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{16 \times 100}{33}\right) = 16.5 + 48.48 \approx 64.98
\]

### **5. Final LIX Score**
Rounded to one decimal place:
\[
\text{LIX} = 65.0
\]

**LIX=65.0**
