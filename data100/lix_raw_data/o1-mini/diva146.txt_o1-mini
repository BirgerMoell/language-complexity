To calculate the **LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex)** readability score for the provided text, we'll follow these steps:

### 1. **Breakdown of the Text**

The text consists of **3 sentences**:

1. **Sentence 1:**  
   "One path of exposure is vapour transport of pollutants into buildings."

2. **Sentence 2:**  
   "Today, new buildings are already being constructed on contaminated land, and in the future contaminated land will probably constitute an important part of the exploitable land with population growing."

3. **Sentence 3:**  
   "It is therefore of great importance to be able to ensure that buildings built on contaminated land gets an acceptable indoor environment."

### 2. **Counting Words**

- **Total Words:**  
  - Sentence 1: 11 words  
  - Sentence 2: 29 words  
  - Sentence 3: 22 words  
  - **Total:** 11 + 29 + 22 = **62 words**

### 3. **Identifying Long Words**

In LIX calculation, **long words** are those with **more than 6 letters**.

- **Sentence 1:**  
  - "exposure" (8)  
  - "transport" (9)  
  - "pollutants" (10)  
  - "buildings" (10)  
  - **Total:** 4 long words

- **Sentence 2:**  
  - "buildings" (10)  
  - "already" (7)  
  - "constructed" (11)  
  - "contaminated" (12)  
  - "contaminated" (12)  
  - "probably" (9)  
  - "constitute" (10)  
  - "important" (9)  
  - "exploitable" (11)  
  - "population" (10)  
  - "growing" (7)  
  - **Total:** 11 long words

- **Sentence 3:**  
  - "therefore" (9)  
  - "importance" (10)  
  - "buildings" (10)  
  - "contaminated" (12)  
  - "acceptable" (10)  
  - "environment" (11)  
  - **Total:** 6 long words

- **Overall Long Words:** 4 + 11 + 6 = **21 long words**

### 4. **Calculating the LIX Score**

The LIX formula is:

\[
\text{LIX} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Words}}{\text{Number of Sentences}} \right) + \left( \frac{\text{Number of Long Words} \times 100}{\text{Total Words}} \right)
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
\text{LIX} = \left( \frac{62}{3} \right) + \left( \frac{21 \times 100}{62} \right) \approx 20.67 + 33.87 \approx 54.54
\]

**Rounded to the nearest whole number:** **55**

### **Result**

**LIX=55**
