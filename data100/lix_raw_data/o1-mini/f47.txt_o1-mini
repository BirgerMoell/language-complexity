To compute the **LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex)** readability score for the provided Swedish text, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Count the Number of Words**
2. **Count the Number of Sentences**
3. **Count the Number of Long Words (6 letters or more)**
4. **Apply the LIX Formula**

### 1. Count the Number of Words
First, we'll count all the words in the text. Words connected by hyphens or slashes are considered single words in the LIX calculation.

**Total Words:** 80

### 2. Count the Number of Sentences
The text contains sentences separated by periods.

**Total Sentences:** 3

### 3. Count the Number of Long Words (6 letters or more)
We'll identify words that have six or more letters.

- **Sentence 1:** 10 long words
- **Sentence 2:** 5 long words
- **Sentence 3:** 10 long words

**Total Long Words:** 25

### 4. Apply the LIX Formula
The LIX formula is:

\[
\text{LIX} = \left(\frac{\text{Number of Words}}{\text{Number of Sentences}}\right) + \left(\frac{\text{Number of Long Words} \times 100}{\text{Number of Words}}\right)
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
\text{LIX} = \left(\frac{80}{3}\right) + \left(\frac{25 \times 100}{80}\right) \approx 26.67 + 31.25 = 57.92
\]

Rounding to the nearest whole number:

**LIX = 58**
