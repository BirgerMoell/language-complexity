To calculate the **LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex)** readability score for the provided text, follow these steps:

### 1. **Count the Number of Words**
The total number of words in the text is **61**.

### 2. **Count the Number of Sentences**
There are **2** sentences in the text:
1. "The essay describes the need for solutions in offices in form of accessories that support an activity-based approach."
2. "Suggested accessories that solve problems studied are presented."

### 3. **Count the Number of Long Words**
A **long word** is typically defined as a word with more than **6 letters**. By counting, we find there are **30** long words in the text.

### 4. **Apply the LIX Formula**

\[
\text{LIX} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Words}}{\text{Number of Sentences}} \right) + \left( \frac{\text{Number of Long Words} \times 100}{\text{Number of Words}} \right)
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[
\text{LIX} = \left( \frac{61}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{30 \times 100}{61} \right) = 30.5 + 49.18 \approx 79.68
\]

### 5. **Final LIX Score**
Rounding to the nearest whole number:

**LIX=80**
