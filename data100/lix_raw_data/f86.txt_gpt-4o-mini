To calculate the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score, you need to use the following formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{(N / M) + (K \cdot 100)}{N} \]

Where:
- \( N \) = Total number of words in the text
- \( M \) = Total number of sentences in the text
- \( K \) = Total number of long words (words with more than 6 letters)

Now, let’s break it down with the provided Swedish text:

1. Count the total number of words (\( N \)):
   - Total words = 93

2. Count the total number of sentences (\( M \)):
   - Total sentences = 5

3. Count the total number of long words (\( K \)):
   - Long words: "samma", "kvällen", "spriten", "revolver", "komme", "mormor", "kriminellt", "pengar", "återvänder", "plötsligt", "skithuvet", "styvsyster" 
   - Total long words = 12

Now plug these values into the formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{(93 / 5) + (12 \cdot 100 / 93)}{93} \]
\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{(18.6) + (12.903)}{93} \]
\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{31.503}{93} \approx 33.78 \]

Since the LIX formula is traditionally simplified to just adding the average sentence length and the percentage of long words, we need to recalculate it correctly:

1. Average Sentence Length (ASL) = \( N / M = 93 / 5 = 18.6 \)
2. Percentage of Long Words (PLW) = \( (K / N) \cdot 100 = (12 / 93) \cdot 100 \approx 12.9 \)

Combining these:

\[ \text{LIX} = ASL + PLW = 18.6 + 12.9 = 31.5 \]

Thus, the LIX readability score is:

LIX=31.5
