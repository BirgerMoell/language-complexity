To analyze the text and compute a LIX (Läsförståelseindex, also known as Readability Index) score, we need to calculate three parameters:

1. Words per sentence (Ws) 
   The text contains 4 sentences with a total of 46 words.

   - Sentence 1: 12 words
   - Sentence 2: 11 words
   - Sentence 3: 12 words
   - Sentence 4: 11 words

   Total words: 46
   Total sentences: 4

   Ws = Total words / Total sentences
   Ws = 46 / 4
   Ws ≈ 11.5

2. Average number of syllables per word (Ns) 
   To calculate this, we need to find the number of syllables for each word, and then find the average. 

   - Sentence 1: Most of to-day's build-ing dam-ages can be linked to mois-ture. 
   1 (Most) + 1 (of) + 2 (today's) + 3 (building) + 2 (damages) + 1 (can) + 1 (be) + 2 (linked) + 2 (to) + 2 (moisture) = 15

   - Sentence 2: Moisture also plays a sig-ni-fi-cant role in health prob-lems re-lated to in-door cli-mate. 
   2 (Moisture) + 3 (also) + 1 (plays) + 4 (significant) + 1 (a) + 1 (role) + 2 (in) + 2 (health) + 2 (problems) + 3 (related) + 2 (to) + 3 (indoor) + 2 (climate) = 25

   - Sentence 3: Build-ing phys-ics is de-spite this rare-ly dis-cussed se-ri-ous-ly dur-ing the build-ing de-sign phase. 
   3 (building) + 2 (physics) + 1 (is) + 2 (despite) + 2 (this) + 3 (rarely) + 3 (discussed) + 3 (seriously) + 3 (during) + 2 (the) + 3 (building) + 2 (design) + 1 (phase) = 26

   - Sentence 4: Pos-si-ble rea-sons in-clude un-clear re-spon-si-bil-i-ties; short-term e-co-nom-ic fo-cus; a frag-men-ti-zed build-ing pro-cess; and lack of prop-er train-ing and com-pe-tence. 
   3 (possible) + 2 (reasons) + 3 (include) + 5 (unclear) + 3 (responsibilities) + 2 (short-term) + 4 (economic) + 2 (focus) + 1 (a) + 4 (fragmentized) + 2 (building) + 2 (process) + 1 (and) + 2 (lack) + 2 (of) + 3 (proper) + 3 (training) + 2 (and) + 3 (competence) = 44

   Total syllables: 15 + 25 + 26 + 44 = 110
   Total words: 46

   Ns = Total syllables / Total words
   Ns = 110 / 46
   Ns ≈ 2.39

3. Sentence length variation (L) 
   This is represented as a percentage, which in an English context is often the percentage of words with 3+ syllables or the presence of words that are unusual in everyday language, that are not considered in this example. However a good rule of thumb is letting L equal 0-10 percent.

L = 5% is a reasonable value for calculation.
L = 0.5

Please note the original text is given in English as a Swedish-like text analysis requiring a LIX calculation, from given context.

The LIX calculation uses the below formula.

LIX = (Ws * 0.5) + (Ns * 100) + (L * 100 * 0.0114)

Based on the computed values.

LIX = (11.5 * 0.5) + (2.39 * 100) + (0.05 * 100 * 0.0114)
LIX ≈  5.75 + 239 + 0.057
LIX ≈ 244.807
