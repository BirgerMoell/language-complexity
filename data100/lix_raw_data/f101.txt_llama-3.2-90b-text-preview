To calculate the LIX readability score, we need to calculate the following values:

1. Average word length (short words): We count the number of short words (with 1 syllable or less).  In this text we have approximately: 14 short words. 
2. Average word length (all words): We calculate the total number of words: there are approximately 46 words in the text. 
We also calculate the total number of syllables of all words in the text: there are approximately 71 syllables. With this we get an average word length of 71 syllables / 46 words = 1.54 syllables per word.
3. Long word density: We count the percentage of words with 3 syllables or more (long words). There are 9 such words, 9 / 46 * 100 = 19.57%.
