To calculate the LIX readability score, we will follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average number of words per sentence (Ł).
We will divide the total number of words by the total number of sentences. 

There are 6 sentences and 76 words in the given text.

Ł = Total words / Total sentences
Ł = 76 / 6 
Ł ≈ 12,67

2. Calculate the average number of letters per word (ł).
To do this, we need to count the total number of letters. We'll ignore the numbers and punctuation.

Total letters ≈ 386

We'll divide the total number of letters by the total number of words.

ł = Total letters / Total words
ł = 386 / 76
ł ≈ 5,08

3. Calculate the LIX readability score.
The LIX formula is: LIX = (Ł + (ł * 100 / 39,65)) / 2

Substitute the values:
LIX = (12,67 + (5,08 * 100 / 39,65)) / 2
LIX ≈ (12,67 + (5,08 * 2,52)) / 2
LIX ≈ (12,67 + 12,81) / 2
LIX ≈ 25,48 / 2
LIX ≈ 12,74

Round the result to two decimal places.

LIX = 12,74
