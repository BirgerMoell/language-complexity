To calculate the LIX (Lexical Index) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: A word is defined as any sequence of characters separated by spaces. In the given text, there are 68 words.

2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: A long word is defined as any word with more than 6 characters. The long words in the text are:
   - "starka" (6 characters)
   - "sammanfattning" (15 characters)
   - "kapitlerna" (10 characters)
   - "inspirerad" (10 characters)
   - "fortsätta" (8 characters)

   The long words are "sammanfattning," "kapitlerna," "inspirerad," and "fortsätta," totaling 4 long words.

3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: A sentence is usually defined as a string of text ending with a period, question mark, or exclamation mark. In the provided text, there are 4 sentences.

Now we apply the LIX formula:

\[ LIX = \left( \frac{W}{S} \right) + \left( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \right) \]

Substituting in the values we found:
- \( W = 68 \)
- \( S = 4 \)
- \( L = 4 \)

Calculating each part:
1. \( \frac{W}{S} = \frac{68}{4} = 17 \)
2. \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} = \frac{4 \times 100}{68} = \frac{400}{68} \approx 5.88 \)

Now, adding these results together for the final LIX score:

\[ LIX = 17 + 5.88 \approx 22.88 \]

Finally, we round the score to one decimal place:

LIX = 22.9
