To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we'll follow the LIX formula:

LIX = (A / O) + (B × 100 / S)

Where:
- A = the number of long words (words with more than 6 letters)
- O = the number of sentences
- B = the number of words
- S = the number of characters (including space)

Now, let's break down the text:

**Text:** 
"An IPM from International Rectifier has been modified and tested by letting the IPM drive a permanent magnet motor under typical load conditions for a long time. The test showed that an IPM is a good alternative for the future, when it comes to the matter of efficiency, cost and space."

1. **Count the Sentences (O)**:
   - There are 2 sentences.

2. **Count the Words (B)**:
   - Total words = 38

3. **Count the Characters (S)**:
   - Total characters (including spaces) = 236

4. **Count the Long Words (A)** (words with more than 6 letters):
   - Long words: "International," "Rectifier," "modified," "permanent," "magnet," "conditions," "efficiency," "alternative" (8 long words).

Now we substitute these values into the LIX formula:

- A (long words) = 8
- O (sentences) = 2
- B (total words) = 38
- S (characters) = 236

Calculating:

LIX = (A / O) + (B × 100 / S)  
LIX = (8 / 2) + (38 × 100 / 236)  
LIX = 4 + (3800 / 236)  
LIX = 4 + 16.10 ≈ 20.10  

Finally, rounding to the nearest whole number gives us a score of 20.

Thus, the result is:

LIX=20
