To calculate the LIX readability score, we need to count the number of words, sentences, and long words (words with 7 or more letters) in the text.

Here is the count:

* Number of words: 76 words
* Number of sentences: 5 sentences
* Long words:
    * motsvarar, högskolepoäng, inblandade, examensarbetets, särskilt, handledare, hjälp, stöd, rådgivning, tekn, lic (13 words)
    * However, some words may be counted multiple times in this count, but for LIX we just count each unique long word once:
    * Unique long words: motsvarar, högskolepoäng, inblandade, examensarbetets, handledare, rådgivning, tekn, lic, (8 words)

To calculate the LIX score, we use the following formula:
LIX = words per sentence + (long words per 100 words) / 100 x 0.4 + 200 x ( (number of words without long words) / ( (number of words without long words / total number of words)^0.19) )

However, in this response a approximation is used for simplification as to be obtained a fairly accurate score LIX can also be calculated with the approximation:
   LIX ≈ words per sentence + proportion of long words * (40 / 7)
Where proportion of long words is calculated as:
   proportion of long words = (Unique long words) / total words * 100

This approximation gives similar results and is to be calculated with more ease.

Using this approximation, we get:

* words per sentence: 76 / 5 ≈ 15.2
* proportion of long words: (8 / 76) x 100 ≈ 10.53%
* LIX ≈ 15.2 + 10.53 x 40/7 ≈ 15.2 + 6.03 x 5.71 = 28.46 ≈ 28.

Therefore:
LIX= 28
