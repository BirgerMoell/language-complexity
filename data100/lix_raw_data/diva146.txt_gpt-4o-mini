To compute the LIX (Lesbarhetsindex) readability score, we use the following formula:

**LIX = (Number of words / Number of sentences) + (Number of long words * 100 / Number of words)**

Where:
- "long words" are defined as words that are longer than 6 characters.

Now, let's analyze the provided text step by step:

1. **Count the number of words**: The text contains 85 words.
2. **Count the number of sentences**: The text consists of 4 sentences.
3. **Identify long words**: Long words (more than 6 characters):
    - "exposure"
    - "vapour"
    - "transport"
    - "pollutants"
    - "buildings"
    - "contaminated"
    - "constructed"
    - "importance"
    - "ensure"
    - "acceptable"
    - "environment"
    
   Total long words = 11.

Now, we can plug these numbers into the LIX formula:

1. Calculate the first part: Number of words / Number of sentences = 85 / 4 = 21.25
2. Calculate the second part: Number of long words * 100 / Number of words = 11 * 100 / 85 ≈ 12.94

Now combine these two parts:

**LIX = 21.25 + 12.94 ≈ 34.19**

Thus, the final result rounded to two decimal places is:

LIX = 34.19
