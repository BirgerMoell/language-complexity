To compute the LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: This includes all the words in the text.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as words with more than 6 letters.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: This includes sentences ending in periods, exclamations, or question marks.

**Text Analysis:**
1. **Word Count (W)**: The given text contains 100 words.
2. **Long Words Count (L)**: The long words are: 
   - "emerge"
   - "exchange"
   - "currently"
   - "densifying"
   - "buildings"
   - "existing"
   - "majority"
   - "creating"
   - "contrasts"
   - "environment"
   - "environment" (counted twice)

   In total, there are 11 long words.
3. **Sentence Count (S)**: The text has 4 sentences.

**LIX Calculation**:
The formula for calculating the LIX score is:
\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \left(\frac{L \cdot 100}{W}\right) \]

Substituting the values derived:
- W = 100
- S = 4
- L = 11

1. Calculate \( \frac{W}{S} \):
   \[ \frac{100}{4} = 25 \]

2. Calculate \( \frac{L \cdot 100}{W} \):
   \[ \frac{11 \cdot 100}{100} = 11 \]

3. Combine these to get the LIX score:
   \[ \text{LIX} = 25 + 11 = 36 \]

Finally, we present the result:

LIX=36
