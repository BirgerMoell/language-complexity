The LIX (Läsbarhetsindex, or "Readability Index") is a Swedish readability test that measures the difficulty of written text. To calculate the LIX score, we need to calculate three components: 

1. The number of words per sentence (average word length is not needed in the LIX calculation).
2. The number of words containing more than 6 letters.
3. The number of long words as a percentage of the total number of words.

Step 1: Calculate the number of words per sentence. We count the sentences and the words:
Sentence 1: 18 words
Sentence 2: 14 words
Sentence 3: 17 words
Sentence 4: 20 words
5 sentences (with 'punkt för punkt'; short sentences) and sentence fragments then remain uncounted. There's 4 valid sentences in four and they give 18+14+17+20= 69. 69/4= 17.25
We use rounding towards the nearest half. Since 0,25 > 0,5 isn't true then we round down: 17

Step 2: Count the number of words with more than 6 letters:
1. funktion
2. ersättas
3. genomförts
4. fastställt
5. omvandla
6. examensarbetet
7. lösning
8. livscykelkostnadskalkyl
9. känslighetsanalys

9 words

Step 3: Calculate the percentage of words with more than 6 letters:
Total number of words = 69
Number of words with more than 6 letters = 9
Percentage of long words = (9/69)*100 = 13

Step 4: Calculate the LIX score using the following formula:
LIX = words per sentence + percentage of long words 

LIX = 17 + 13 = 30

LIX = 30
