To compute the LIX (Lexikalischer Index) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we first need to break the text into its components and then apply the LIX formula, which is:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{N \, + \, \frac{100 \times S}{N}}{L} \]

where:
- \( N \) is the total number of words,
- \( S \) is the number of long words (defined as words with more than 6 letters),
- \( L \) is the total number of sentences.

Now, let's analyze the provided text:

1. **Count the words (N)**: 
   - The text contains 78 words.

2. **Count long words (S)**: 
   - Long words (more than 6 letters): "academic," "benchmark," "aerodynamics," "experiment," "optimization," "tunnel," "available," "geometry," "developed," "algorithm," "theoretical," "increase," "predicted," and "shortcomings." 
   - Total long words = 14.

3. **Count the number of sentences (L)**: 
   - The text contains 3 sentences.

Now we can plug these values into the LIX formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{78 \, + \, \frac{100 \times 14}{78}}{3} \]
\[ = \frac{78 \, + \, \frac{1400}{78}}{3} \]
\[ = \frac{78 \, + \, 17.95}{3} \]
\[ = \frac{95.95}{3} \]
\[ \approx 31.99 \]

Thus, rounding to the nearest whole number, we find:

**LIX = 32**.
