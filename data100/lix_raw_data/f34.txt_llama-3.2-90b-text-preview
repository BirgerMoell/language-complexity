To calculate the LIX readability score, we need to calculate the following three variables:

1. ord/aktigt ord (words average length in letters, but excluding short words of 3 letters or less).
2. ord/meningslängd (words/phrase-length, or average number of words per phrase).
3. meningar/ord (phrases/sentence or average number of phrases per sentence).

To calculate these variables, we will:
- separate the text into phrases. 
- Count the words without spaces and the phrases themselves, then,
- Count the letters in all the words (or 'ord') longer than 3 letters. We will then calculate the LIX using a calculator.

Using the text provided:
1. ord/aktigt ord calculation:
   - Total words excluding short words of 3 letters or less is 41.
   - Total letters for all words in the text excluding short words of 3 letters or less is 187.

    187 letters / 41 words = 4.56 average word-length.

2. ord/meningslängd calculation:
   Total phrases are the same as total sentences, so there are 8 phrases.
   Total words excluding spaces in the phrases, or sentences is 86.

   So, 
   86 words / 8 phrases = 10.75 average word-length.

3. meningar/ord calculation:
   There are also 8 phrases and 3 'ordinary phrases,' counted by their separating period (.) and non use of : or other period punctuation. Since 3 non-period-punctuated and 8 punctuated phrases (ordinarily 3 phrases including these cases were an assortment of colons etc) there are the same number of punctuations separating the assortment's sentences.
   8 phrases / 8 phrases => 1

Once we have these variables, we can calculate the LIX-readability-score using the LIX formula.
LIX = avg(word-length) + avg(words/sentence) * 100 / avg(simple- or main-phrases/sent-phrase) *0.4). 
Where Avg stand for 'average'

Average word length (actigt ord, word-length) = 4.56
Average words/phrase  = 10.75
 Average simple sentences in phrases per phrase = 0.4 * (the 'Menings enheter / meningar' here averaging within higher-sentence phrasing sentence average for higher-sentence)
 Meningar = 0.4 

Using the calculator.
   -> 4.56 + (10.75 *100 / 1) *0.4
LIX result = 4.56 + 10.75 * 0.4 * 4.56 + 10.75 ->
