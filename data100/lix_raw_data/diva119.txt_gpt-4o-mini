To calculate the LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we first need to collect the necessary components:

1. **Total number of words (W)**: Count how many words are in the text.
2. **Total number of long words (L)**: Count how many words are longer than 6 characters.
3. **Total number of sentences (S)**: Count how many sentences are in the text.

After analyzing the provided text:

- **Word count (W)** = 92
- **Long word count (L)** = 15 (counting only those words longer than 6 characters)
- **Sentence count (S)** = 5

The LIX formula is as follows:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \frac{L \times 100}{W} \]

Now substituting the values into the formula:

1. Calculate the first part: \( \frac{W}{S} = \frac{92}{5} = 18.4 \)
2. Calculate the second part: \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} = \frac{15 \times 100}{92} \approx 16.3 \)
3. Combine both parts: 

\[ \text{LIX} = 18.4 + 16.3 = 34.7 \]

Now we can present the result:

LIX=34.7
