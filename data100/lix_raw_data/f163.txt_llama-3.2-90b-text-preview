To calculate the LIX readability score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Count the number of words in the text. 
   There are 56 words in the text.

2. Count the number of periods (.) in the text, which indicates the number of sentences.
   There are 5 periods, but 3 of them are not ending sentences, they are part of other sentences or the use of '(/' and '.)'. We have 4 sentences.

3. Calculate the average sentence length by dividing the total number of words by the number of sentences.
   Average sentence length = 56 words / 4 sentences ≈ 14 words per sentence.

4. Count the number of long words in the text. A long word is typically defined as a word with more than 6 letters.
   There are 17 long words in the text.

5. Calculate the percentage of long words in the text by dividing the number of long words by the total number of words and multiplying by 100.
   Percentage of long words = 17 / 56 ≈ 0.304 or 30.4%

6. Now, we can calculate the LIX readability score using the following formula:
   LIX score = (Average sentence length x 0.2) + (Percentage of long words x 0.15) x 100
   LIX score = (14 x 0.2) + (30.4 x 0.15) x 100
   LIX score = 2.8 + 4.56 x 100
   LIX score = 2.8 + 4.56
   LIX score ≈ 46.56, so rounding to nearest whole number
   LIX score ≈ 47

LIX = 47
