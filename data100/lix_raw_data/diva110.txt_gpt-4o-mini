To compute the LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score, we use the following formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{(\text{number of words})}{(\text{number of sentences})} + \frac{(\text{number of long words}) \times 100}{(\text{number of words})} \]

Where:
- A long word is defined as one with more than 6 characters.

Let's analyze the provided text step-by-step:

1. **Count the number of words**: The text has a total of 128 words.
2. **Count the number of sentences**: The text contains 4 sentences.
3. **Count the number of long words**: The long words (>6 characters) in the text are:
   - suggested (9)
   - solution (8)
   - translation (10)
   - metadata (8)
   - performance (10)
   - partition (8)
   - userdata (8)
   - mapped (6) - not counted since it's exactly 6
   - associative (12)
   - sector (6) - not counted since it's exactly 6
   - system (6) - not counted since it's exactly 6
   - instead (7)
   - separates (8)
   - modified (8) - appears twice
   Counting these, we find that there are 11 long words.

Now we can compute the LIX score:

1. \( \text{Number of words} = 128 \)
2. \( \text{Number of sentences} = 4 \)
3. \( \text{Number of long words} = 11 \)

Plug these values into the LIX formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{128}{4} + \frac{11 \times 100}{128} \]

Calculating each part:

- \( \frac{128}{4} = 32 \)
- \( \frac{11 \times 100}{128} = \frac{1100}{128} \approx 8.59 \)

Now combine these results:

\[ \text{LIX} = 32 + 8.59 \approx 40.59 \]

Rounding this gives us:

LIX = 41 (rounded to the nearest whole number).

Thus, the final score is:

LIX=41
