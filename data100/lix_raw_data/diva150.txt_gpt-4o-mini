To compute the LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: This includes all words in the text.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as words with more than 6 characters.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: This can be done by identifying the number of full stops, question marks, and exclamation marks that indicate the end of sentences.

Now let's break down the provided text:

- **Text**: "An extensive literature study has been made to evaluate all techniques on the market and characterize what separates the different processes. Also machine performance and material quality is evaluated, and advantages and disadvantages are listed for each technique. The techniques are widely separated in powder bed processes and material deposition processes. The powder bed techniques allow more design freedom while the material deposition techniques allow production of large articles."

### Step 1: Count the elements

- **Count of words (W)**: 
  The text consists of 108 words.

- **Count of long words (L)**: 
  Long words (more than 6 characters) include: 
  extensive, literature, evaluate, techniques, separate, different, processes, performance, material, quality, evaluated, advantages, disadvantages, listed, technique, separated, powder, deposition, techniques, production, articles, and freedom. 
  There are 21 long words.

- **Count of sentences (S)**: 
  There are 4 sentences in this text (indicated by full stops).

### Step 2: Apply the LIX formula

The formula for calculating LIX is:

\[ 
LIX = \frac{W}{S} + \left(\frac{L \times 100}{W}\right) 
\]

### Plugging in our values:

- W = 108
- L = 21
- S = 4

Calculating each part:

1. \( \frac{W}{S} = \frac{108}{4} = 27 \)
2. \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} = \frac{21 \times 100}{108} \approx 19.44 \)

Now we can calculate the total LIX:

\[
LIX = 27 + 19.44 \approx 46.44 
\]

### Final Result

Rounding the result gives us:

LIX=46.44
