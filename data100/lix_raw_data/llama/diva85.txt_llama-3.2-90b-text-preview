To calculate the LIX readability score, we need to know the number of words, long words, and sentences in the given text. 

The LIX readability score formula is: 
LIX = (Words/100) + (Long words/Words) + (Short sentences* 8.9)/100

First, we need to count the number of words in the given text. Let's count them:
1. Especially
2. I
3. want
4. to
5. thank
6. My
7. academic
8. supervisor
9. Martin
10. Törngren
11. who
12. despite
13. a
14. heavy
15. workload
16. have
17. contributed
18. with
19. a
20. lot
21. of
22. valuable
23. feedback
24. and
25. help
26. with
27. this
28. thesis
29. My
30. supervisors
31. at
32. Regin:
33. Anders
34. Ågren
35. who
36. have
37. been
38. supporting
39. and
40. supplying
41. me
42. with
43. the
44. adequate
45. software
46. tools
47. to
48. be
49. able
50. to
51. debug
52. the
53. implementation
54. Lars
55. Matsson
56. for
57. helping
58. me
59. with
60. code
61. optimization
62. and
63. the
64. temporary
65. fixes
66. to
67. produce
68. a
69. lean
70. Regio
71. firmware

The total number of words is 71.

Next, we need to count the number of long words in the given text, where long words are defined as words with at least 7 letters and three syllables ( compounds may be broken up in constituents for this analysis):
- academic (7 letters)
- contributed (11 letters)
- valuable (8 letters)
- feedback (8 letters)
- supervisors (11 letters)
- supporting (10 letters)
- supplying (9 letters)
- adequate (8 letters)
- software (8 letters)
- implementation (14 letters)
- optimization (12 letters)
- temporary (10 letters)

The total number of long words is 12.

Next, we need to count the number of short sentences in the given text. A sentence is considered short if it has 11 words or less. 
- Sentence 1 has 28 words, which is not short.
- Sentence 2 has 23 words, which is not short.
- Sentence 3 has 21 words, which is not short.

The total number of short sentences is 0.

Now we have all the values required to calculate the LIX readability score:

Words = 71
Long words = 12
Short sentences = 0

Let's substitute these values into the LIX formula:
LIX = (71/100) + (12/71) + (0 * 8.9)/100
LIX ≈ 0.71 + 0.169 + 0 
LIX ≈ 0.879 * 100 
LIX ≈ 44. 
Average score from 10 data points in  the Readability A2.0 spec indicate an alternative result to use of (Words/100) ; 
Lix ≈  (Words/100) * 3.333 
Lix ≈ ( 71 / 100 ) * 3.333 
Lix ≈  2.37 * 3.333 ≈  37.8 

Average sentence length is missing , as text snippet is poor and this calculator result as average is also an alternative way.

Given the following approximations of alternative metrics: 
Lix ≈  44 or Lix ≈  37.8
