To calculate the LIX readability score, we'll follow these steps: 

1. Calculate the number of words,  
2. Calculate the number of sentences,  
3. Calculate the number of long words (words with 6 or more letters), and  
4. Use the LIX formula: LIX = (A + B) × 100 ÷ C.  

Where A is the average number of words per sentence, B is the percentage of long words, and C is a constant.

Step 1: Number of words. The given text contains 96 words.

Step 2: Number of sentences. There are 4 sentences.

Step 3: Number of long words. There are 35 words with 6 or more letters in the given text.

Step 4: Apply the LIX formula.

First, we calculate A (the average number of words per sentence):
A = 96 words / 4 sentences ≈ 24.

Next, we calculate B (the percentage of long words):
B = 35 long words / 96 total words * 100 ≈ 36.46%.

Now, use the LIX formula:
LIX = (24 + 36.46) * 100 ÷ 14 
LIX = 60.46 * 100 ÷ 14 
LIX = 6050 ÷ 14
LIX ≈ 42.5

Now rounding to the nearest whole number,
 
LIX = 43
