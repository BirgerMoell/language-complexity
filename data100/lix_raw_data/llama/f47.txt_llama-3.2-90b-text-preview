To calculate the LIX readability score, we'll need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of words with 3 or more syllables.
2. Calculate the average number of words per sentence.
3. Calculate the percentage of long words (words with 3 or more syllables).
4. Plug these values into the LIX formula.

Here's the breakdown:

**Text statistics:**

* Total words: 77
* Number of words with 3 or more syllables: 14 (e.g., energiförbrukning, transformatorer, digitalkamera, hot-swap, etc.)
* Number of sentences: 4

**Calculations:**

1. Average number of words per sentence: 77 words / 4 sentences = 19.25 words/sentence
2. Percentage of long words: 14 words / 77 words * 100% ≈ 18.18%

**LIX formula:**

LIX = (Average number of words per sentence) + (Percentage of long words * 100/5)

**Plugging in the values:**

LIX = 19.25 + (18.18 * 100/5)
LIX = 19.25 + (18.18 * 20)
LIX = 19.25 + 363.6
LIX = 382.85 / 100 ≈ 38.3 (no, this is not right).

Use simply LIX = average number of words per sentence + percentage of long words.
LIX = 19.25 + 18.18
LIX = 37.43 

(Note that the LIX score ranges from 20 to 60, with higher scores indicating more complex text.)
