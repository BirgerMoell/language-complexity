To compute the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score from the given text, I will follow the instructions.

LIX is a measure of readability developed by the Swedish researcher, Björn Anderson. It is based on two factors: the average length of the sentences and the percentage of long words.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:
1. Determine the total number of words in the text. For this, I will manually count the words in the text.

Here are the words:
1. Förekom
2. Lukt
3. kändes
4. i
5. flera
6. lägenheter
7. Alla
8. lägenheterna
9. hade
10. mer
11. eller
12. mindre
13. missfärgad
14. ekparkett
15. Del
16. 2
17. 1,0
18. 27.1
19. 27.2
20. 92
21. hela
22. omr
23. 55
24. st
25. 92
26. hela
27. omr
28. 100
29. st
30. Radhus
31. Del
32. 1
33. Radhus
34. Lukt
35. i
36. flera
37. lgh
38. 1
39. 2
40. 1
41. 2
42. I
43. flera
44. lägenheter
45. känns
46. stark
47. lukt
48. från
49. fuktskadad
50. tryckimpregnerat
51. trä
52. 1,8
53. Lukt
54. i
55. flera
56. lgh
57. RADHUS
58. PARHUS
59. BILAGA
60. 2

Total words: 60
2. Determine the number of long words. 'Long words' refers to words with 7 or more letters.
Here are the long words:
- lägenheter (appears twice)
- missfärgad
- hela
- omr (this might not be a word)
- lägenheterna
- fuktskadad
- tryckimpregnerat

Total long words: 7
3. Determine the total number of sentences. Since there is no punctuation, it's difficult to set the number of sentences exactly, but there appear to be 4 or 5 units of sentences. To keep this process more general, we can say 4-5 (as between RADHUS and / has two unit separators and is quite long).
Let's assume there are 5.
4. Now we can calculate the average sentence length by dividing the total number of words (60) by the total number of sentences (5).

Average sentence length: 60 / 5 ≈ 12
5. Now we can calculate the percentage of long words by dividing the total number of long words (7) by the total number of words (60) and multiplying by 100.

Percentage of long words: 7 / 60 * 100 = 11.66 ≈ 11.7
6. Combine the two factors: make the sum 100 times the average sentence length plus percentage of long words.

Combined factor: (100 * 12) + 11.7 ≈ 1217

7. Finally, take the square root of the combined factor to obtain the LIX readability score.

LIX = √(1217) = 34.9 (rounded to one decimal place)
