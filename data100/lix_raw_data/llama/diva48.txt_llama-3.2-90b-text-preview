To calculate the LIX readability score of the Swedish text, we need to follow these steps:

1. Count the total number of words in the text. 
   In this text there are 64 words.

2. Calculate the total number of periods (.) in the text and divide that number by the total number of words. This is called the "periods per word".
   In this text, there are 4 periods. 4 periods / 64 words ≈ 0.0625 periods per word.

3. Divide the words into simple words (with fewer than 7 letters, excluding common punctuation and suffixes -et, -ar, -en, -s in Swedish if part of compound word or hyphenated then counting each word separately) and complex words (7 letters or more).
   Complex words (7 letters or more): 
   1. tacken (eremit; tack is not a complex word even though tacken is so in English has been selected)
   2. bidragit
   3. synpunkter
   4. speciel
   5. beslutsfattande
   6. framföra, 
   Total number of words in this category = 6 but for our LIX we only require those with more than 6 letters excluding previous special exceptions since there was six for a single hyphenated pair we must round our estimate 5 > complex i. Therefore:
   there are 7 complex words 

   Now define the total number of long (complex) words per 100 words of text. Divide the number of words with 7 letters or more by the total number of words and then multiply by 100. 
   So, 7 complex words / 64 * 100 ≈ 10,9

4. Calculate the LIX score using the following formula:
   LIX = (periods per word) * 100 + words per 100 words * (percentage of long words)
   Calculating this produces:
   LIX ≈ 0,0625 * 100 + 10,9 ≈ (6,25 + 10,9)  >> 17,15 is our rough calculated value of Lix, which now can be used giving:
  
LIX ≈ 17
