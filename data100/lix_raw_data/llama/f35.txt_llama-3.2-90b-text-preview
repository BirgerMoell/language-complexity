To calculate the LIX score, we need to measure three factors:

1. Average word length (ordsnittlig ordlängd): This is the average number of letters per word.
2. Percentage of long words (andel långa ord): This is the percentage of words with 7 letters or more.
3. Average sentence length (ordsnittlig meninglängd): This is the average number of words per sentence.

Here's how to calculate these factors for the given text:

**1. Average word length**

1. Count the total number of letters in the text: 236
2. Count the total number of words in the text: 76
3. Calculate the average word length: 236 letters / 76 words = 3.11 letters per word (round to 2 decimal places).

However, since the letters include 8 spaces out of the letters we counted for the average. But we also did not include the periods at the end of the sentence which also occupy a space typically in Swedish. Take in other symbols we get on average that the letters are what for 4 letters + space (period or space that might occupy in conjunction with some other punctuation.) 76  * 5 letters in average = 380 letter places on on average the word has 5 letters.

**2. Percentage of long words**

Count the number of words with 7 letters or more: 23 words
Calculate the percentage: (23 words / 76 words) x 100% ≈ 30.26% (round to 2 decimal places).

**3. Average sentence length**

Count the total number of words in the text: 76
Count the total number of sentences in the text: 4
Calculate the average sentence length: 76 words / 4 sentences = 19 words per sentence.

Now, calculate the LIX score using the following formula:

LIX = (average word length x 0.0668) + (percentage of long words x 0.0778) + (average sentence length x 0.0645)

Using the rounded values: 
LIX = (5.0 x 0.0668) + (30.26 x 0.0778) + (19 x 0.0645)
LIX = 0.334 + 2.3561 + 1.2255
LIX ≈ 4.0
