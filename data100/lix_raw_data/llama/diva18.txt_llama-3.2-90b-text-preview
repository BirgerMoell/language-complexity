To calculate the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex or Sweedish Readability Index) score, I will follow these steps:

1. Count the words: 
There are 56 words in the text.

2. Calculate the average number of words per sentence: 
There are 4 sentences. 
Average words per sentence = 56 words / 4 sentences = 14 words per sentence.

3. Calculate the percentage of words with more than 6 characters ( long words): 
Long words in the text: 
 'många', 'komponenter', 'används', 'kolvringar', 'tryckluftsystemet', 'bestämma', 'acceptanskriterium', 'allvarlig'
There are 9 long words out of 56 words.
Percentage of long words = (9 long words / 56 total words) x 100% ≈ 16.07%

4. Calculate the LIX score: 
Using a calculator:
LIX score = ( Average words per sentence x 0.4 ) + ( Percentage of long words x 0.1 )

First step: ( 14 x 0.4 ) = 5.6
Second step: ( 16.07 x 0.1 ) = 1.607 
Adding them: 5.6 + 1.607 = 7.207

Rounded off: 7.21 

The result is:
LIX = 7.21
