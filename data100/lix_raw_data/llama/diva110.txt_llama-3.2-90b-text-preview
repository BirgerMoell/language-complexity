To calculate the LIX readibility score, we'll use the following formula:

LIX = (words/sentence) * (long words/total words) * 100

Where 'long words' are words with more than 6 characters.

Here's the given Swedish text: 

(Note: The text is actually in English)

The suggested solution uses a translation layer called Metadata FTL (MFTL), where file system metadata and userdata are separated from each other in order to improve performance. The partition holding userdata uses a block-level mapped translation layer system called Fully Associative Sector Translation FTL. The other partition, holding metadata, will instead use a page-level mapped translation layer system which also separates often modified data from data modified seldom.

Now, let's break the text down into words and count the long words with more than 6 characters:

Total words: 43

Words per sentence:
- Sentence 1: 22 words
- Sentence 2: 22 words
- Sentence 3: 12 words
Words/sentence = (22+22+12)/3 = 18.6667

Long words: 
('suggested', 'separated', 'translate', 'performance', 'translate', 'translate', 'userdata' x2, 'metadata', 'partition' x2, 'translation' x3, 'layer' x2, 'system' x2, 'Fully', 'associative' 'sector', 'modified' x2)

Note: There is a different number of long words possible. Where this analysis places the limit at words with more than 6 characters then placed the limit after 6 characters here: 
 'separated', 'metadata,' 'userdata,'  'translation,' 'partition,' 'metadata,' 'userdata,'  'performance,' 'translation,' 'system' 'modified,'  'sector,' 'translated,' 'layer'  (Here from 'sector') 'Fully' and 'associative' were moved here also:  

The number of long words is therefore around 19

Now, let's calculate the LIX score:

LIX = (words/sentence) * (long words/total words) * 100
LIX = 18.6667 * (19/43) * 100
LIX = 18.6667 * 0.4429 * 100
LIX â‰ˆ 82.72
