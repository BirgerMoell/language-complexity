To calculate the LIX readability score, we need to follow these steps: 

1. Calculate the average sentence length in words.
   There are 2 sentences in the given text. 
   Sentence 1: 19 words
   Sentence 2: 19 words
   The average sentence length = (19 + 19) / 2 = 19

2. Calculate the percentage of long words.
   A long word is defined as a word with 6 or more letters (excluding compound words and proper nouns).
   Sentence 1: presenteras, rapporten, litturstudie, examensarbetet - 4 long words
   Sentence 2: försök, mätningar, konceptprototyp, intervjuer - 4 long words
   The total number of long words = 8
   The total number of words = 38
   The percentage of long words = (8 * 100) / 38 ≈ 21.05%

3. Calculate the LIX score using the following formula:
   LIX = (average sentence length * 0.4) + (percentage of long words * 0.1)

   Using a calculator:
   LIX ≈ (19 * 0.4) + (21.05 * 0.1) ≈ 7.6 + 2.105 ≈ 9.705

LIX ≈ 10 (round to the nearest whole number)
