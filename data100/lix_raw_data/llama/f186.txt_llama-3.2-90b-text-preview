To calculate the LIX readability score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of words: 
   I counted 76 words in the text.

2. Calculate the number of sentences:
   There are 5 sentences in the text.

3. Calculate the average number of words per sentence:
   Average words per sentence = 76 words / 5 sentences = 15.2 words per sentence.

4. Calculate the percentage of long words (7 letters or more):
   I counted 26 long words in the text. 
   Percentage of long words = (26 / 76) * 100 = 34.21%

5. Calculate the LIX score using the following formula:
   LIX = (Average words per sentence * 0.4) + (Percentage of long words * 0.1)
   LIX = (15.2 * 0.4) + (34.21 * 0.1)
   LIX = 6.08 + 3.421
   LIX = 9.5

So, 
LIX= 9.5
