To calculate the LIX readability score, we will use the standard LIX formula. The LIX score is calculated based on the average number of words per sentence and the percentage of long words (words with 7 or more letters).

Here's the breakdown of the text:
Total words: 104 
Total sentences: 4
Total words with 7 or more letters: 74

First, we will calculate the average number of words per sentence:
Average words per sentence: Total words / Total sentences
= 104 words / 4 sentences
= 26 words per sentence

Next, we will calculate the percentage of long words:
Percentage of long words: Total words with 7 or more letters / Total words
= 74 words with 7 or more letters / 104 Total words
= 0.712 or 71.2%

Now we will convert these values into a LIX score:

LIX score: (0.4 * Average words per sentence) + (Average number of long words per 100 words)
Note the number of long words per 100 words can be computed as (Percentage of long words * 100). 
= (0.4 * 26) + (71.2)
= 10.4 + 71.2
LIX = 81.6
