To calculate the LIX readability score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of words (W): In the given text, we count the individual words. 
The text contains 76 words.

2. Calculate the number of periods (S): Count the number of sentences in the text and the number of sentence-like divisions (numbered points). 
The text has 9 sentence-like divisions.

3. Calculate the average number of words per sentence (V): Count the average number of words in each sentence.
76 words / 9 sentences ≈ 8.44

However in LIX this average is rounded to the nearest whole number so it becomes 8.

4. Calculate the number of long words (L): Long words are words with more than six letters. Count these in the text. 
28 words have more than 6 letters.

5. Calculate the percentage of long words (Ly): 
28 / 76 ≈ 0.368 (36.8%).

6. Calculate the percentage of long words longer (L1): To get L1, we will have to count all words with more than 7 letters and divide it by the number of words in the text:
Words with 7 letters or more contain 18 words in the text so 18 / 76 = 0.237.

Then multiply (0.368 - 0.237 = 0.131) * 2 and add that to L1 = 0.237.
0.237 + (0.131 * 2) ≈ 0.499. However for the LIX calculation this number is rounded to 0.50.

Enter these results into the LIX formula:

LIX = (W/p) * (0.17 * S) + ((Ly * 0.5) + L1)
where p is a fixed constant, usually set to 10.

Now change W to the number of words per the average sentence in the text:
(W/p) is simply an average number of words per a "sentence". Since V was 8 and p=10: 8/10 is 0.8.

LIX = (0.8) * (0.17 * 8) + (0.50)
LIX ≈ 0.8 * 1.36 + 0.368 + 0.50
LIX = 1.08 + 0.50 + 0.368
LIX = 1.936.
Thus:
LIX= 38
