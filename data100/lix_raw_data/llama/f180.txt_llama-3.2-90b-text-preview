To compute the LIX readability score, I will analyze the Swedish text and follow the LIX formula. The LIX score is a measure of readability, with lower scores indicating easier-to-read texts.

The LIX formula is:
LIX = (number of words / (number of periods + 1)) * (number of long words / number of words) * 100

Here's how I broke down the text:
- Number of words: 43 (counted each word in the text)
- Number of periods: 4 (counted the number of periods that end the sentences)
- Number of long words: I counted the words with more than 6 characters, which is 21 words.

Using the LIX formula:

- (number of words / (number of periods + 1)) = 43 / (4 + 1) = 8.6
- (number of long words / number of words) = 21 / 43 = 0.488
- Multiplying and adding the last factor of 100:
  LIX = 8.6 * 0.488 * 100 = 42

LIX=42 

This result is considered average in terms of readability.
