The LIX (Läsbarhetsindex, or Readability Index) is a measure of the readability of written text, primarily used to measure the difficulty of understanding written Swedish. 

To calculate the LIX, you need three variables: 
1. Average number of words per sentence (Ż).
2. Average number of letters per word (Dł).
3. Percentage of long words (more than six letters) in the text (LDW).

Formula to calculate LIX: LIX = Ż / 5 + Dł + 2 * LDW 

Step 1. Find the values for variable 1: 
The given text contains 26 words, arranged in 2 sentences. 
Ž = 26 / 2 = 13.

Step 2. Find the values for variable 2: 
We count all the letters and get 123. 
Dł = 123 / 26 ≈ 4.73.

Step 3. Find the values for variable 3: 
Counting the long words (> 6 letters): 
- investigation 
- qualitative 
- public
- municipalities
- planning
- practice 

We have 6 long words out of 26. 
(LDŻ) = (6 / 26) * 100 = 23.08%.

Step 4. Plug the variables into the LIX formula:
LIX = Ž / 5 + Dł + 2 * LDW
LIX = 13 / 5 + 4.73 + 2 * 23.08%
LIX = 2.6 + 4.73 + 2 * 0.2308
LIX = 2.6 + 4.73 + 0.4616
LIX = 7.77 (round to two decimal places)

LIX = 7.77
