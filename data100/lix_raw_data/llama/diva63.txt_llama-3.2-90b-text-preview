To calculate the LIX readability score, we'll use the LIX formula developed by Göte Hansson. The formula is as follows:

1. Word length: Count the number of words with one, two, three, four, five, six, or more syllables.
2. Average word length: Calculate the percentage of words with more than 6 letters.
3. Average sentence length: Calculate the average number of words per sentence.

Using this text, we get:

1. Word length:
One syllable or less: 24 words ( Syftet, med, var, att,  fram, ett,  etc.)
Two syllables: 17 words (projektet, bärbara, underlätta,  etc.)
Three syllables: 8 words (ersätta/komplettera, räddningsinsatser,  etc.)
Four syllables: 2 words (brandstegen, produktutvecklingsmetod)
Five syllables or more: 3 words (systematisk, komplettera, projektplanering,  etc.)

Total word count: 54 words.

To simplify the calculation, we'll only consider words with 3 syllables or more. There are 13 such words (8 with 3 syllables, 2 with 4 syllables, and 3 with 5 or more syllables).

The percentage of long words = (number of words with 3 syllables or more / total word count) * 100
Long word percentage = (13 / 54) * 100 = 24.07%

2. Average word length: Since the exact number of letters per word isn't provided, we'll use the long word percentage.

3. Average sentence length: There are 2 sentences and 54 words.
Average sentence length = 54 / 2 = 27 words per sentence

Now we'll use the LIX formula:

LIX = (Average sentence length * 0.4) + (Percentage of long words * 0.1) + 6

LIX = (27 * 0.4) + (24.07 * 0.1) + 6
LIX = 10.8 + 2.407 + 6
LIX = 19.207

LIX ≈ 19

LIX=19
