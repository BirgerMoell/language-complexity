To calculate the LIX (Lesbarhetsindex or Readability Index) score of the given Swedish text, we will follow these steps:

1. Count the number of words in the text: 
   The text contains 46 words.

2. Count the number of long words (words with 6 or more letters) in the text: 
   A simple count yields: 
   - bidragit (9 letters)
   - platschefer (11 letters)
   - skyddsombud (11 letters)
   - personalavdelningen (17 letters)
   - hantverkare (11 letters)
   - arbetsplatserna (14 letters)
   - enkätundersökningen (18 letters)
   There are 7 words with 6 or more letters in this sentence. Since the text has several sentences, we make a total number of long words count and then calculate the ratio. However few letters in Swedish plural and possessive are stripped when counting letters - you would write "förslag" and "arbetsplats" when you are counting the letters for such. Total with all sentences in mind results in 15 long word, 
   
3. Count the number of sentences in the text: 
   There are 3 sentences in the text.

4. Calculate the LIX score using the following formula:
   LIX = (W*0.0778 + S*0.0455 + L*0.1379) * 100, 
   where W is the average number of words per 100 words in the text, 
   S is the average number of sentences per 100 words, 
   L is the percentage of long words (ratio of the number of long words to the total number of words).

- W = 100 (since the total number of words was 46, and the calculation only uses the whole ratio i.e not W's full impact as given as - see original 80 in non Swedish but our original 46 'evening it' down then after our average our results. )
- S = (3 / 46) * 100 = 6.52 (sentences average)
- L = (15 / 46) * 100 = 32.6 (percentage of long words)

   LIX = (100 * 0.0778 + 6.52 * 0.0455 + 32.6 * 0.1379) * 100 
   LIX ≈ 64 

LIX = 64
