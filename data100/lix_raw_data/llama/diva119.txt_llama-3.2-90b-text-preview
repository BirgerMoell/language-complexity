To calculate the LIX readability score, I will analyze the given Swedish text, but since it is actually in English, I will treat it as one.

Here's the analysis:

1. Total number of words: 46
2. Total number of long words (7 letters or more): 14 (advantages, efficient, manufacturing, developing, traditional, regardless, material, complex, methods, challenges, further, replace, efficiency, standing)
3. Total number of sentences: 3 (Note: for LIX, a sentence is usually defined as an independent clause with a subject and a predicate. However, I will use the given periods as sentence delimiters in this case.)
4. Average number of words per sentence: 46 / 3 = 15.33 

Now, using these values, we can calculate the LIX readability score. LIX is defined by the following formula:

LIX = (total word count / total sentence count) + (total long word count * (100 / total word count))

LIX = 46 / 3 + 14 * (100 / 46)
LIX = 15.33 + 0.30435 * 100
LIX = 15.33 + 30.435
LIX = 45.765 (rounding this result is not needed in this calculation)

However, the above is actually the German readability score "Lesbarkeitsindex"' that is on the per basis of the formula known as LIX. 

The original LIX index that that was developed in Sweden the late 1960 can not be produced with this type of text and is considered more reliable and there is different scoring with that.
