To compute the LIX (läsbarhetsindex, or readability index) score, I'll follow the Swedish formula:

1. Count the number of words in the text.
2. Count the number of long words (6 characters or more).
3. Count the number of sentences.
4. Calculate the average sentence length by dividing the total number of words by the number of sentences.
5. Calculate the percentage of long words by dividing the number of long words by the total number of words.
6. Calculate the LIX score using the formula:

LIX = (average sentence length x 0.5 + percentage of long words x 100) * 0.4

Using a calculator, I'll apply these steps to the text:

1. Number of words: 96
2. Number of long words:
- virusmakare (2)
- utmaningen (2)
- optimala (1)
- uttrycket (2)
- mina (1) (excuded, since less than 6 characters) 
- kunskaper (2)
- maskinspråket (1)
- bättre (2)
- omöjliga (1)
- spåra (1) (excuded, since less than 6 characters) 
- skriva (1) (excuded, since less than 6 characters) 
- föröka (1) (excuded since less than   6) 
- själv (1) (excuded since less than 6) 
- tusentals (1)
- viruses (excuded since not swedish word) 
- skrivs (excuded, since less than 6 characters) 

There are 13 words with at least 6 characters.

3. Number of sentences: 4
4. Average sentence length: 96 words / 4 sentences = 24
5. Percentage of long words: 13/96 * 100% ≈ 13.54%
6. LIX score:
LIX = ((24 x 0.5) + (13.54 x 0.4)) ≈ (12 + 5.42) ≈ 17.42

LIX= 17.42
