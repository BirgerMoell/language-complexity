To compute the LIX (Läsvårhetsindex, or "readability index") score, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Count the total number of words in the text.
2. Count the total number of sentences in the text.
3. Count the number of long words in the text (words with more than 6 characters).
4. Calculate the average word length and sentence length.
5. Use the following formula to calculate the LIX score:

LIX = (avg_word_length * 0.4) + (avg_sentence_length * 0.7) + (long_words_percentage * 0.6)

Let's go through the steps:

1. Total number of words: 34
2. Total number of sentences: 2
3. Number of long words (words with more than 6 characters): 
   * När, företaget, närma, kommersiell, lansering, utveckla
   * användarcentrerad, Servohandske, bakgrunden, användare, utvecklas
   * tillgodose
   Total: 12 long words
4. Average word length:
   Total number of characters: 176
   Total number of words: 34
   Average word length = 176 / 34 ≈ 5.18
5. Average sentence length:
   Total number of words: 34
   Total number of sentences: 2
   Average sentence length = 34 / 2 = 17
6. Long words percentage:
   (Number of long words / Total number of words) x 100%
   (12 / 34) x 100% ≈ 35.3%

Now, let's plug in the values into the formula:
LIX = (5.18 * 0.4) + (17 * 0.7) + (35.3 * 0.6)
LIX ≈ 2.07 + 11.9 + 21.18
LIX ≈ 35.15

Rounded to the nearest whole number:
LIX ≈ 35

LIX= 35
