To calculate the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex, or Readability Index) score in Swedish, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average number of words per sentence (Ź/s).
   There are 2 sentences, and a total of 46 words. 
   Ź/s = Total words / Total sentences = 46 / 2 ≈ 23

2. Calculate the percentage of long words ( StL, more than 6 letters) in the text, (percentage of words).
   From the text, the number of words with more than 6 letters is 21, Out of the total 46 words. 
   StL =  (Number of long words / Total words) * 100 ≈ (21 / 46) * 100 ≈ 45.65%

3. Use the LIX formula: LIX = (Ź/s * 0.4) + StL 
   LIX ≈ (23 * 0.4) + 45.65 ≈ 9.2 + 45.65 ≈ 54.85

However, since the original LIX definition divides this result by 0.4, we obtain 
LIX ≈ 54.85 / 0.4. Then  using our  original formula for LIX ≈ (Ź/s * 0.4) + StL is:
LIX= {(Ź/s * 0.4) + StL}/ 0.4 then   
≈ 54.85
