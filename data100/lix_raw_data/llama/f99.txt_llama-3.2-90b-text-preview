To calculate the LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Count the number of words in the text. 
2. Count the number of sentences in the text.
3. Count the number of long words (words with 6 characters or more).
4. Calculate the average number of words per sentence.
5. Calculate the percentage of long words.

The text contains:
- 46 words
- 5 sentences
- 19 long words

Now, let's calculate the average number of words per sentence:
46 words / 5 sentences = 9.2 words per sentence

Next, let's calculate the percentage of long words:
(19 long words / 46 total words) * 100 = 41.3%

Now, we can calculate the LIX score using the following formula:
LIX = (words per sentence * 0.4) + (long words percentage * 0.3) + (0.06 * long words percentage if this number is higher than 23), in this case, we need to calculate this number

To do this we multiply 0.06 by the difference between the percentage and 23:
(41.3 - 23) = 18.3
18.3 * 0.06 = 1.098
Then we calculate the LIX:
LIX = (9.2 * 0.4) + (41.3 * 0.3) + (1.098)
LIX = 3.68 + 12.39 + 1.098
LIX = 17.17 

So the calculated LIX score for the text would be:
LIX= 17.17
