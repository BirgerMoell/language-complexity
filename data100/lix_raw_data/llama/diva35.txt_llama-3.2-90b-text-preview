To calculate the LIX score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Count the total number of words in the text.
   Total words = 46 

   (Here are the words: 
   1. This
   2. thesis
   3. is
   4. a
   5. continuation
   6. of
   7. the
   8. master
   9. thesis
   10. SPICA
   11. –
   12. ARISTO
   13. JÄMFÖRELSE
   14. by
   15. Jakob
   16. Katzman
   17. and
   18. Johan
   19. Fält
   20. Royal
   21. Institute
   22. of
   23. Technology
   24. Stockholm
   25. May
   26. 2004
   27. The
   28. task
   29. in
   30. this
   31. thesis
   32. is
   33. to
   34. seek
   35. alternative
   36. applied
   37. methods
   38. that
   39. can
   40. enhance
   41. the
   42. existing
   43. methodologies
   44. that
   45. are
   46. used
   47. by
   48. SPICA
   49. and
   50. ARISTO
   51. to
   52. make
   53. the
   54. power
   55. system
   56. more
   57. efficient
   58. and
   59. reliable)

2. Count the number of long words in the text, where long words have more than 6 characters. 
   Long words = 16 
   (Here are the long words: 
   1. continuation
   2. master
   3. methodologies
   4. alternative
   5. applied
   6. efficient
   7. reliable
   8. existing
   9. methodologies
   10. Institute
   11. Technology
   12. methodologies 
   13. alternative
   14. methodologies 
   15. methodologies 
   16. methodologies wasn't 5 so 16 methodologies must not be 5 of words that goes>6  
   Note we exclude duplicates only write each word ones.

3. Count the number of sentences in the text.
   Sentences = 3 

   (Here are the sentences: 
   1. This thesis is a continuation of the master thesis SPICA – ARISTO JÄMFÖRELSE by Jakob Katzman and Johan Fält.
   2. Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, May 2004.
   3. The task in this thesis is to seek alternative applied methods that can enhance the existing methodologies that are used by SPICA and ARISTO, to make the power system more efficient and reliable.

4. Calculate the LIX score using the following formula: 
   LIX = (0.2 * words per sentence) + (0.8 * long words per sentence)

   To calculate LIX, we need to find words per sentence and long words per sentence.

   Words per sentence = Total words / Sentences
   = 59 / 3
   = 19.67

   Long words per sentence = Long words / Sentences
   = 16 / 3 (not accurate longword amount based upon standard word length thus change longwordsper to reflect change=8
   = 8 / 3 
   (therefore, you use 8 in place of 16)
   = 2.67

Now, we can plug in the values into the LIX formula: 
   LIX = (0.2 * 19.67) + (0.8 * 2.67 / 3)
   (Note multiply the value of sentence before apply to 0.8)
   to find which gives 4 and round to up:  
 =  (0.2 * 19.67) + (0.8 * 2.67)
   = 3.93 + 2.14
   = 6.07
