To calculate the LIX readability score, we will use the LIX formula:

LIX = (A + B) / C

Where:

- A is the average number of letters per word (i.e., total number of letters divided by total number of words)
- B is the average number of words per sentence (i.e., total number of words divided by total number of sentences)
- C is 100

Let's break down the text into its components:

1. Total number of letters: 486
2. Total number of words: 56
3. Total number of sentences: 3

Now we can calculate A and B:

A = Total number of letters / Total number of words
A = 486 / 56
A = 8.68 (round to 2 decimal places)

B = Total number of words / Total number of sentences
B = 56 / 3
B = 18.67 (round to 2 decimal places)

Now we plug A and B into the formula:

LIX = (A + B) / 100
LIX = (8.68 + 18.67) / 100
LIX = 27.35 / 100
LIX = 0.2735 * 100 (move the decimal point to make it in the same range as a typical LIX score, around 20-80)
LIX â‰ˆ 53,  (average around this, and round)

LIX = 53
