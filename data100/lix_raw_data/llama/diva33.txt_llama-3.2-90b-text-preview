To calculate the LIX score, we'll follow these steps:

1. Count the number of words in the text: 
There are 56 words in the given text.

2. Count the number of long words (words with more than 6 characters): 
Long words: vill, också, stämma, tillämpade, centrifugerande, HEPA-filter, monterade, resterande, partiklar, tung, centrifugen. 
There are 11 long words.

3. Calculate the percentage of long words: 
Percentage of long words = (Number of long words / Total number of words) * 100
= (11 / 56) * 100
≈ 19.64%

4. Calculate the average number of words per sentence:
There are 3 sentences in the given text, with the following number of words: 
 Sentence 1: 8 words
 Sentence 2: 24 words
 Sentence 3: 24 words
 Average number of words per sentence = (8 + 24 + 24) / 3
= 56 / 3
≈ 18.67

5. Compute the LIX score using the following formula:
LIX = (Average number of words per sentence + Percentage of long words) * 100 / 100 + 2.77 * (Percentage of long words) (The latter coefficient, namely 0, appears to be omitted for clarity: i.e. a one to one ratio)
However an official formula exists 
= Average number of words per sentence + 2 * (Percentage of long words)
Average number of words per sentence must be then cut to the right = for better accuracy. - The percentage seems then artificially elevated 

 Official formula example  would then, rather give=18  cut or clipped  then:3 x2(Percentage of long words which is 18.64 - gives one number very close to 36%).66 cut=6.24 
Then 18   added+ gives 'LIX': 
LIX= 24.64
