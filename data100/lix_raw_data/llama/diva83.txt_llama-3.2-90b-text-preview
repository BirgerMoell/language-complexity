To calculate the LIX readability score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Count the total number of words in the text.
2. Count the total number of sentences in the text.
3. Count the total number of long words (words with 6 characters or more) in the text.
4. Calculate the average sentence length by dividing the total number of words by the total number of sentences.
5. Calculate the percentage of long words by dividing the total number of long words by the total number of words.
6. Plug these values into the LIX formula.

Here's the calculation:

1. Total number of words: 72
2. Total number of sentences: 4
3. Total number of long words: 37 (words with 6 characters or more)

To find the average sentence length:
Average sentence length = Total number of words / Total number of sentences
= 72 / 4
= 18

To find the percentage of long words:
Percentage of long words = (Total number of long words / Total number of words) * 100
= (37 / 72) * 100
≈ 51.39%

The LIX formula is:
LIX = (Average sentence length + (Percentage of long words * 100)) / 100

Plugging in the values:
LIX = (18 + (51.39 * 100) / 100) / 100 * (100/ 500) *5 
= (18 + 51.39) * (100/ 500) * 5 
≈ (69.39 * 0.2) * 5
≈ 13.878 

After rounding to one digit after the decimal point:
≈ 13.9

LIX = 13.9
