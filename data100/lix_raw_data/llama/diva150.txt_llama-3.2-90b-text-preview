To calculate the LIX readability score for the given text, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Calculate the average number of words per sentence. The text consists of 4 sentences:
- Sentence 1: 17 words
- Sentence 2: 16 words
- Sentence 3: 16 words
- Sentence 4: 20 words
Average words per sentence: (17 + 16 + 16 + 20) / 4 = 69 / 4 = 17.25
Since we can't have fractions of a word, we round up to 17.25, and then round to 17.

2. Calculate the percentage of long words (words with 6 or more letters). From the text, we have:
- Total words: 69
- Long words: (extensive, literature, evaluate, characterization, separates, processes, advantages, disadvantages, deposition, production)
  (17 words with more than 5 letters but we need to count the exact number above 5)
  exact number: 13 
- Long word percentage: (13 * 100) / 69 â‰ˆ 18.84

3. Calculate the LIX score using the formula: LIX = ( (Average number of words per sentence) + (Percentage of long words * 100)) / ( Average number of words per sentence / 1)
 
However simplified this can be expressed :
LIX = W + (100 x L / W) 
Where 
  W is the "word density" or average number of words per sentence; and 
  L is the percentage of "long words" in the text.
 Result according to simplified form: 
 LIX = (17 + ((100 * 0.1884) / 17)) 
 This calculates to 
LIX = 18.84
