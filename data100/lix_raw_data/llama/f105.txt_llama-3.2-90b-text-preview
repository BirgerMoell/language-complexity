To calculate the LIX readability score, we will use the LIX formula which takes into account the percentage of long words (more than 6 characters) and the average number of words per sentence.

Here's how we calculate the LIX score for the given text:

1. Count the total number of words in the text: 
After counting, we get 76 words.

2. Identify and count the long words (more than 6 characters):
From the list of words with more than 6 characters, we get:
1. exempeL
2. osäker
3. mailen
4. skräppost
5. misstänker
6. smittad
7. virus
8. filförlagen
9. kommunikationsenheter
10. filvirus
11. programfil
12. sorter

There are 12 long words.

3. Calculate the percentage of long words:
Percentage of long words = (number of long words / total number of words) * 100
= (12 / 76) * 100 ≈ 15.79%
Since we cannot have decimal numbers in the LIX formula, we round to the nearest whole number: 16% ≈ 16.

4. Count the total number of sentences:
After counting, we get 4 sentences.

5. Calculate the average number of words per sentence:
Average words per sentence = total number of words / total number of sentences
= 76 / 4
= 19

Now, we can use the LIX formula:
LIX = (words per sentence + percentage of long words) / 2 * 100 * 0.4
= (19 + 16) / 2 * 100 * 0.4
= (35 / 2) * 40
= 17.5 * 40
= 70
But in the LIX scale, the weighted average is based on the multiplication of a base, in this system a base of 'long words per hundred words', multiplied by 0.4 for longer sentences, so the final answer would be more aligned to:
LIX = 35 * 0.4 
LIX ≈ 35 * 0.4
Therefore: LIX = 42
