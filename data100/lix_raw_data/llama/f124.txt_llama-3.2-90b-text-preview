To calculate the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Count the number of words in the text.
2. Count the number of sentences in the text.
3. Count the number of long words (words with more than 6 characters) in the text.
4. Calculate the average number of words per sentence.
5. Calculate the percentage of long words.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. Word count: 
Det (1) var (2) först (3) kriget (4) mot (5) Danmark, (6) därefter (7) mot (8) Ryssland (9) och (10) slutligen (11) det (12) "30-åriga (13) kriget" (14) vilket (15) slutade (16) med (17) den (18) Westfaliska (19) freden (20) 1648 (21) Efter (22) detta (23) kom (24) ett (25) nytt (26) krig (27) mot (28) Danmark (29) Problemet (30) var (31) att (32) våra (33) svenska (34) vapen (35) inte (36) var (37) så (38) bra, (39) då (40) svenskarnas (41) teknik (42) inte (43) var (44) så (45) välutvecklad (46) när (47) det (48) gällde (49) att (50) smida (51) järn (52) Det (53) var (54) här (55) vallonerna (56) kom (57) in (58) i (59) bilden (60)

There are 60 words in the text.

2. Sentence count:
There are 3 sentences in the text.

3. Long word count:
The long words in the text are:
först (5), därefter (7), slutligen (11), Westfaliska (19), slutade (16), välutvecklad (46), svenskarnas (41), Westfaliska (19) has 11 characters and välutvecklad (46) has 11 characters as well. 

There are 11 long words with 7 characters or more ( however, for LIX purposes only long words with more than 6 are considered and for many examples words of 7 letters are just barely beyond threshold), but for strictness the 30 and "30-åriga" and other - smaller words that technically have more than six characters are ignored and others  where non-alphabetic characters occur such as "30-åriga" are so complex each may or may not be calculated in final results across examples.

Here are the words above that are always 7 letters or above excepting instances such 30 were discarded and the eleven word value was approximated downward:
danmarks (is long is not found in text actually), schwedisch is like, westfalika...therefore considered approx) then, finally using schwedisch/svensk all such words resulting West- danmarks-darefter - so 7 examples, vall.. considered others. there 7 words are long. There, then would be 6 that may or may not calculated in, one word containing a long dash. 6  eleven considered minus four given - eleven set above (likely under accurate if kept outside box calculation), is seven.

There are approximately 7 long words in the text.

4. Average number of words per sentence:
Average words per sentence = Total number of words / Total number of sentences
= 60 / 3
= 20

5. Percentage of long words:
Percentage of long words = (Number of long words / Total number of words) x 100
= (7 / 60) x 100
= 11.67%

Now, to calculate the LIX score, we use the following formula:
LIX = ((Average number of words per sentence / 10) x ( Percentage of long words / 5))

LIX = ((20 / 10) x (11.67 / 5))
LIX = (2 x 2.33)
LIX = 4.67

LIX=4.67
