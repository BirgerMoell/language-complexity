To calculate the LIX readability score, we will use the LIX formula, which is based on the following steps:

1. Count the total number of words (TW) in the text.
2. Count the total number of sentences (TS) in the text.
3. Count the total number of long words (LW), i.e. words with more than 6 characters.
4. Calculate the average sentence length (ASL) by dividing the total number of words by the total number of sentences.
5. Calculate the percentage of long words (PLW) by dividing the total number of long words by the total number of words and multiplying by 100.

The LIX formula is: LIX = ASL + PLW * 0.4

From the provided text, we get:

TW (Total words) = 56 
TS (Total sentences) = 5 
LW (Long words) = 26 (the long words are: 'folkmord', 'mördades', 'bomben', 'förfler', 'riktigt', 'historiska', 'perspektiv', 'biologiska', ' psykologiska', 'konsekvenser', 'förföljelser')

ASL (Average sentence length) = TW / TS = 56 / 5 = 11.2
PLW (Percentage of long words) = LW / TW * 100 = 26 / 56 * 100 = 46.43%

Now, plug in the numbers into the LIX formula:
LIX = 11.2 + 46.43% * 0.4 
First, convert 46.43% into a decimal (0.4643) and multiply it by 0.4:
LIX = 11.2 + 0.18572
LIX = 11.38572

Round the result to a whole number.

LIX = 47
