To calculate the LIX readibility score, I will follow the instructions and perform the calculations as follows:

1. Calculate the average number of words per sentence: There are 4 sentences, and the total number of words is 56. Therefore, the average number of words per sentence is:
56 / 4 = 14

2. Calculate the average number of letters per word:
Total number of letters: 271
Total number of words: 56
Average number of letters per word: 271 / 56 ≈ 4.84

3. Calculate the number of long words (words with more than 6 letters):
Count the number of long words:
1. Uppgraderingsmöjligheter
2. större
3. mera
4. tilläggskort
5. exempelvis
6. scanners
There are 6 words with more than 6 letters. Since the total number of words is 56, the number of long words as a percentage is:
(6 / 56) * 100 ≈ 10.71%

4. Calculate the LIX score using the following formula:
LIX = 0,194 * (average number of words per sentence) * 100 + 
     0,00046 * (average number of letters per 100 words) * 100 + 
     0,426 * (long words as a percentage)
Substituting the calculated values:
LIX = 0,194 * (14) * 100 + 0,00046 * (271 / 56) * 100 * 56 / 100 + 0,426 * 10.71
LIX = 26.96 + 0.53 + 4.55
LIX ≈ 32.04

However, the calculated LIX value of 32.04 requires rounding to get a meaningful result. Rounded to the nearest whole number:
LIX ≈ 32.

This might still not give the desired answer due to methods varying.
