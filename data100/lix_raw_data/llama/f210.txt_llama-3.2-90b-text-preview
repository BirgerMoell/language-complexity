To calculate the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score of the given text, I'll break down the steps and use a calculator.

The LIX formula is based on two factors: the average number of words per sentence (Läsbarhetsindex X) and the average number of long words (words with more than 6 characters) per 100 words (Läsbarhetsindex Y). These two values are then combined to get the final LIX score.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. Calculate the average number of words per sentence (X):
The text consists of 4 sentences.
- Sentence 1: 11 words
- Sentence 2: 24 words
- Sentence 3: 24 words
- Sentence 4: 11 words
Total words: 11 + 24 + 24 + 11 = 70 words
Total sentences: 4
Average words per sentence (X) = 70 / 4 = 17.5

2. Calculate the average number of long words (words with more than 6 characters) per 100 words (Y):
- Count the number of long words: 
  - Snåljåpsmonstret (2 occurrences)
  - filmduken
  - månadspeng
  - naturligtvis
Total long words: 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5 long words
Total words: 70
Average long words per 100 words (Y) = (5 / 70) * 100 ≈ 7.14

3. Calculate the LIX score using the following formula:
LIX = X + (Y * 0.4)
= 17.5 + (7.14 * 0.4)
= 17.5 + 2.856
≈ 20.36

LIX = 20.36
