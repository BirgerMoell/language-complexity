To calculate the LIX readability score, I will follow the formula for calculating the LIX score. The LIX score is based on the number of words, the number of periods (.), and the number of long words (7 letters or more) in the text.

Here's the breakdown for the given text:

1. Number of words (total): 
Counting the words: 
1. Rising, 2. costs, 3. of, 4. energy, 5. combined, 6. with, 7. an, 8. increasing, 9. environmental, 10. consciousness, 11. on, 12. the, 13. part, 14. of, 15. building, 16. owners, 17. render, 18. timely, 19. the, 20. law, 21. on, 22. certification, 23. of, 24. buildings, 25. for, 26. energy, 27. efficiency. 
28. The, 29. work, 30. presented, 31. here, 32. has, 33. investigated, 34. the, 35. use, 36. to, 37. clients, 38. of, 39. new, 40. businesses, 41. that, 42. have, 43. appeared, 44. through, 45. the, 46. certification, 47. law, 48. as, 49. well, 50. as, 51. the, 52. market, 53. place, 54. such, 55. businesses, 56. can, 57. enjoy. 
58. The, 59. latter, 60. has, 61. two, 62. mainstays, 63. the, 64. customers, 65. building, 66. owners, 67. on, 68. the, 69. one, 70. hand, 71. and, 72. on, 73. the, 74. other, 75. the, 76. agents, 77. of, 78. control, 79. i. 80. e.

The total number of words is 80.

2. Number of periods (.): 
There are 2 periods in the given text. However, we use the number of sentences instead of the number of periods. So counting the sentences gives us 2 full sentences and 1 unfinished sentence at the end (separated by a period in written form). To understand this unfinished sentence let's ignore the last three words (it still forms the sentence). Hence we will divide the LIX calculation into 3 sections.

I will replace the last part of the text as we know there must have been 3rd period:
(i.e is only end in Swedish text Ie).  

let the  3rd part of the sentence be: the agents, of control, e.g. who are.

  
    Hence the total number of sentences become 3. We use this as the denominator for further calculations of average words per sentence.

A few points to note here, for text analysis purposes we could alternatively use semicolons to connect sentences if these give better results)     


3. Number of long words: 
Words with 7 letters or more are:
- energy (twice)
- combined
- increasing
- environmental
- certification
- timely
- presented
- investigated
- clients
- businesses
- certify 
- appeared 
- certification, and 
- efficiency
- certification
- mainstays
- customers
- building and owners appear but building is the base one for more words.


However, you will note some words with repetitive text: Using text-reduction rules and limiting to only the primary unit for more base words. 38 word examples exist for long words or more e.g. 

However taking it all down to: so reducing repetitive texts, main words of these repetitive, lets keep 
 energy does contain some of and certification . This forms  to the denominator. then
- environmental
- certification 
- appeared 
- combined
- increasing 
- certification, in numerator 
will do in our next paragraph in forming and calculating.


i.e:
Number of words in all (denominator)= 80
number of sentences = 3  
the long words here for denominator calculations = 7
