To calculate the LIX readability score of the Swedish text, I'll first translate it to identify the text's original content: 

Text in English: Since China is still considered a developing country, it is also  still a lot different from Sweden, but it is changing rapidly. Most of the environmental laws  that were studied are parts of the legal framework, which means that no exact limits or  detailed guidelines are given. The company brings its cutting-edge technology, which still is  new and unknown to the industrial park in China. Therefore it is too early to decide whether  company F complies with the local jurisdiction in China.

Now, let's analyze the given English text for calculating LIX readability score.

The LIX readability score formula is:

LIX = (A + B + C)/3 * 100 

Where A is the average number of letters per word, B is the percentage of long words (more than six letters) in the text, and C is the average number of words per sentence.

Step 1: Count the total number of words and letters in the text.
The text has 46 words. 

Letter count: 1. Since -> 6 letters, 2. China -> 5 letters, 3. is -> 2 letters, 4. still -> 5 letters, 5. considered -> 9 letters, 6. a -> 1 letter, 7. developing -> 10 letters, 8. country -> 7 letters, 9. it -> 2 letters, 10. is -> 2 letters, 11. also -> 4 letters, 12. still -> 5 letters, 13. a -> 1 letter, 14. lot -> 3 letters, 15. different -> 9 letters, 16. from -> 4 letters, 17. Sweden -> 6 letters, 18. but -> 3 letters, 19. it -> 2 letters, 20. is -> 2 letters, 21. changing -> 8 letters, 22. rapidly -> 7 letters, 23. Most -> 4 letters, 24. of -> 2 letters, 25. the -> 3 letters, 26. environmental -> 12 letters, 27. laws -> 4 letters, 28. that -> 4 letters, 29. were -> 4 letters, 30. studied -> 7 letters, 31. are -> 3 letters, 32. parts -> 5 letters, 33. of -> 2 letters, 34. the -> 3 letters, 35. legal -> 5 letters, 36. framework -> 10 letters, 37. which -> 5 letters, 38. means -> 5 letters, 39. that -> 4 letters, 40. no -> 2 letters, 41. exact -> 5 letters, 42. limits -> 6 letters, 43. or -> 2 letters, 44. detailed -> 8 letters, 45. guidelines -> 10 letters, 46. are -> 3 letters, 47. given -> 5 letters, 48. The -> 3 letters, 49. company -> 7 letters, 50. brings -> 6 letters, 51. its -> 3 letters, 52. cutting-edge -> 12 letters, 53. technology -> 10 letters, 54. which -> 5 letters, 55. still -> 5 letters, 56. is -> 2 letters, 57. new -> 3 letters, 58. and -> 3 letters, 59. unknown -> 7 letters, 60. to -> 2 letters, 61. the -> 3 letters, 62. industrial -> 9 letters, 63. park -> 4 letters, 64. in -> 2 letters, 65. China -> 5 letters, 66. Therefore -> 9 letters, 67. it -> 2 letters, 68. is -> 2 letters, 69. too -> 3 letters, 70. early -> 5 letters, 71. to -> 2 letters, 72. decide -> 6 letters, 73. whether -> 7 letters, 74. company -> 7 letters, 75. F -> 1 letters, 76. complies -> 8 letters, 77. with -> 4 letters, 78. the -> 3 letters, 79. local -> 5 letters, 80. jurisdiction -> 12 letters, 81. in -> 2 letters, 82. China -> 5 letters. 

The total number of letters in the text is 422.

Step 2: Calculate average number of letters per word (A) 
Total letters = 422, Total words = 82 
A = 422 / 82 = 5.15
