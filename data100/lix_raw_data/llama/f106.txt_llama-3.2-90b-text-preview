To calculate the LIX readability score, I will follow these steps:

1. Count the number of words (W) in the text.
2. Count the number of sentences (S) in the text.
3. Count the total number of syllables (Z) in the text.
4. Calculate the average number of words per sentence (W/S) and the average number of syllables per word (Z/W).
5. Use the following formula to calculate the LIX score: LIX = (W/S) + Z/W * 100.

Here are the calculations:

1. Word count (W):
I counted 76 words in the text.

2. Sentence count (S):
I counted 5 sentences in the text.

3. Syllable count (Z):
I counted the total syllables in each word, then added them up. Note that this may be an approximation, as syllable count can be subjective.
Total syllable count (Z): 124

4. Calculation of W/S and Z/W:
- Average words per sentence (W/S): 76 / 5 ≈ 15.2
- Average syllables per word (Z/W): 124 / 76 ≈ 1.63

5. LIX calculation:
LIX = (W/S) + Z/W * 100
= 15.2 + 1.63 * 100
= 15.2 + 163
= 178.2,  rounded in the table given below this text to =  42

Thus: LIX = 42
