To compute the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score for the given Swedish text, follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: Count all the words in the provided text.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Count the number of words that are longer than 6 letters.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: Count how many sentences are in the text.

The LIX formula is as follows:

\[ LIX = \frac{W}{S} + \frac{L \times 100}{W} \]

Now let’s analyze the text:

- **Counting the elements**:
  - Total number of words (W): 108
  - Number of long words (L): 22
  - Number of sentences (S): 6

2. **Plug the values into the LIX formula**:
   - \( \frac{W}{S} = \frac{108}{6} = 18 \)
   - \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} = \frac{22 \times 100}{108} \approx 20.37 \)

3. **Calculate LIX**:
   - \( LIX = 18 + 20.37 \approx 38.37 \)

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get a final score.

LIX=38
