To calculate the LIX score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Count the total number of words in the text.
   Total words: 56

2. Count the number of short sentences (5-19 words) in the text.
   Short sentences: 4

3. Calculate the average sentence length by dividing the total words by the number of sentences.
   Average sentence length: 56 / 4 ≈ 14

4. Calculate the percentage of long words (words with 7 or more letters) in the text.
   Total words: 56
   Long words: 24
   Percentage of long words: (24 / 56) * 100 ≈ 42.86%

5. Calculate the LIX score using the formula: 
   LIX = ((Syller/ord)*0.0338 + (meningslängd*0.066)) .
   Here: 
   Syller/ord = percentage of long words = 42.86
   Meningslängd = average sentence length = 14

   Plug the numbers into the formula: 
   LIX ≈ ((42.86*0.0338) + (14*0.066))

6. Use a calculator to find the result:
   First, calculate (42.86*0.0338): 
   1.449828
   Then, calculate (14*0.066): 
   0.924 

   Add those numbers together:
   1.449828 + 0.924 = 2.373828

So the LIX score is approximately 2.37.

LIX = 42
