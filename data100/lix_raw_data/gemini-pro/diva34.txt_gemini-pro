**LIX readability score calculation:**

1. Count the number of long words (words with more than 6 letters): 13
2. Count the number of sentences: 4
3. Count the number of characters excluding spaces: 222
4. Compute LIX according to the formula: LIX = (Words/Sentences) + (Characters/Words) x 100
5. LIX = ((13/4) + ((222/13) x 100)) = 35.46

**Result: LIX=35.46**
