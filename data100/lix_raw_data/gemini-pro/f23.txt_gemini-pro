**LIX calculation:**

* Count the number of words: 52
* Count the number of long words (more than 6 letters): 18
* Count the number of complex sentences (sentences with more than two finite verbs): 5
* Calculate LIX: LIX = (number of long words / number of words) * 100 + (number of complex sentences / number of sentences) * 1
* Calculate LIX: LIX = (18 / 52) * 100 + (5 / 8) * 1 = 34.62

**Result:**
LIX=34.62
