**Analysis:**

The Swedish LIX readability index is calculated as follows:

1. Count the number of sentences in the text.
2. Count the number of words in the text.
3. Count the number of long words (more than six letters) in the text.
4. Calculate the LIX score using the formula: LIX = (Words/Sentences) + (LongWords/Sentences) - 36

**Calculation:**

1. Sentences: 5
2. Words: 89
3. Long Words: 23
4. LIX = ((89/5) + (23/5)) - 36 = 42.6 - 36 = **6.6**

**Result:**

LIX = 6.6
