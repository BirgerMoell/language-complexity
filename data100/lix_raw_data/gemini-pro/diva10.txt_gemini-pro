**Steps to calculate LIX:**

1. Count the number of words in the text.
2. Count the number of long words (words with more than six letters).
3. Count the number of sentences in the text.
4. Calculate LIX using the following formula: LIX = (number of words / number of sentences) + (number of long words / number of words) * 100

**Results:**

1. Number of words: 87
2. Number of long words: 27
3. Number of sentences: 9

**LIX calculation:**

LIX = ((87 / 9) + ((27 / 87) * 100))
LIX = 11.36 + 31.03
LIX = 42.39

**Result:**

LIX=42.39
