**Step 1: Calculate Average Sentence Length (ASL)**

Count the number of words and sentences in the text:

* Words: 52
* Sentences: 3

ASL = 52 words / 3 sentences = 17.33 words/sentence

**Step 2: Calculate Average Word Length (AWL)**

Count the number of characters in the text and divide by the number of words:

* Characters: 282
* Words: 52

AWL = 282 characters / 52 words = 5.42 characters/word

**Step 3: Calculate LIX Readability Score**

Use the following formula:

LIX = ASL + AWL - 28

LIX = 17.33 + 5.42 - 28 = **44.75**

**Result:**

LIX = 44.75
