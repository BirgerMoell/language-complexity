**Analysis:**

* **Number of words:** 114
* **Number of long words (over 6 letters):** 42
* **Number of sentences:** 8

**LIX Readability Score Calculation:**

```
LIX = (Number of words / Number of sentences) + (Number of long words / Number of words) * 100
```

```
LIX = (114 / 8) + (42 / 114) * 100
```

```
LIX = 14.25 + 36.84
```

```
LIX = 51.09
```

**Result:**

LIX = 51.09
