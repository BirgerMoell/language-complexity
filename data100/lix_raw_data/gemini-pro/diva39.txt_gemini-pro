**LIX Readability Score Calculator**

1. Count the total number of words in the text: 65
2. Count the number of sentences in the text: 10
3. Count the number of long words (at least 6 characters) in the text: 8

**Formula:**

LIX = (Words / Sentences) + (Long words / Words) * 100

**Calculation:**

(65 / 10) + (8 / 65) * 100 = 6.5 + 12.31 = 18.81

**Result:**

LIX = 18.81
