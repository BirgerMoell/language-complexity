**Word count:** 43
**Long words (more than 6 letters):** 12
**Sentences:** 4
**Average sentence length (words):** 10.75

**LIX score:** ((43 + 12) / 4) * 10.75 = **30.7**

**Explanation:**
The LIX readability score is calculated using the following formula:

```
LIX = ((words + long_words) / sentences) * average_sentence_length
```

where:

* words is the number of words in the text
* long_words is the number of words with more than 6 letters
* sentences is the number of sentences in the text
* average_sentence_length is the average number of words per sentence

Using the values calculated above, we get a LIX score of 30.7.

**Result:**
LIX=30.7
