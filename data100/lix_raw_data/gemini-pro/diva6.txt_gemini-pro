**LIX calculation:**

1. Count the number of words in the text: 30
2. Count the number of sentences in the text: 4
3. Count the number of long words (words with more than 6 letters): 19
4. Calculate the LIX score as follows: LIX = (Number of long words / Number of words) * (Number of sentences / Number of words)
5. LIX = (19 / 30) * (4 / 30) = 0.22

**Result:**
LIX = 0.22
