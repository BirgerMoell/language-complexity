**Number of characters (excluding spaces):** 1325

**Number of letters with accent marks:** 41

**Number of sentences:** 3

**LIX formula:** LIX = (100/number of words) * (number of characters + number of letters with accent marks) / number of sentences

**Number of words:** 202

**LIX calculation:**

LIX = (100/202) * (1325 + 41) / 3
LIX = 0.495 * 1366 / 3
LIX = 0.495 * 455.33
LIX = 226.02

**LIX = 226.02**
