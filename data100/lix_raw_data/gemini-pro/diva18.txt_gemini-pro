**LIX Calculator Results**

Using the LIX Calculator, we obtain the following values:

* Number of sentences: 7
* Number of words: 102
* Number of long words (more than 6 letters): 21

**LIX Score Calculation**

The LIX score is calculated using the formula:

```
LIX = (Number of words / Number of sentences) + (Number of long words / Number of sentences) * 100
```

Substituting the values from above:

```
LIX = (102 / 7) + (21 / 7) * 100 = 14.57 + 300 = 314.57
```

**Result**

LIX = **314.57**
