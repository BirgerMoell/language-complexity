**LIX readability score calculation:**

1. **Count the number of sentences:** There are 5 sentences in the text.
2. **Count the number of words:** There are 56 words in the text.
3. **Count the number of long words:** A long word is defined as having 6 or more letters. There are 26 long words in the text.

**LIX formula:**

```
LIX = (number of long words / number of words) * 100 + (number of sentences / number of words) * 100
```

**Plugging in the values:**

```
LIX = (26 / 56) * 100 + (5 / 56) * 100
LIX = 57.14 + 8.93
LIX = 66.07
```

**Result:**

LIX = 66.07
