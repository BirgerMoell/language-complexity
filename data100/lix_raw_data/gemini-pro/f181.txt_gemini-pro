**LIX Calculator:**

The LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) formula is:
LIX = (Number of words / Sentences) + (Number of long words / Number of words) * 100

**Number of words:** 138
**Number of sentences:** 8
**Number of long words (words with more than 6 letters):** 88

**LIX Calculation:**

```
LIX = (138 / 8) + (88 / 138) * 100
LIX = 17.25 + 63.77
LIX = 81.02
```

**Result:**

LIX = 81.02
