**LIX Calculation:**

LIX calculates the average number of long words (words with more than 6 letters) per sentence and the average number of sentences per 100 words.

**Average number of long words per sentence:**

Number of long words = 25
Number of sentences = 6
Average = 25 / 6 = 4.17

**Average number of sentences per 100 words:**

Number of words = 105
Number of sentences = 6
Average = (6 / 105) * 100 = 5.71

**LIX score:**

LIX = Average number of long words per sentence + Average number of sentences per 100 words
LIX = 4.17 + 5.71
**LIX = 9.88**
