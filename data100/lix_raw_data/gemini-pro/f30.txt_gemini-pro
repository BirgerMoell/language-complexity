**Step 1: Prepare the text**

- Count the number of words: 55
- Count the number of sentences: 5

**Step 2: Calculate the average sentence length (ASL)**

ASL = Number of words / Number of sentences
ASL = 55 / 5 = 11

**Step 3: Calculate the percentage of long words**

A long word is defined as a word with more than 6 letters.

- Count the number of long words: 27
- Percentage of long words = Number of long words / Total number of words * 100
Percentage of long words = 27 / 55 * 100 = 49.09%

**Step 4: Calculate the LIX readibility score**

LIX = ASL + (Percentage of long words * 0.5)
LIX = 11 + (49.09% * 0.5) = **40.05**

**Result:**

LIX = 40.05
