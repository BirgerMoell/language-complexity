**Analysis:**

* Number of words: 64
* Number of long words (more than 6 letters): 42
* Number of sentences: 8

**LIX score calculation:**

LIX = (Number of long words / Number of words) * 100 + (Number of sentences / Number of words) * 100
LIX = (42 / 64) * 100 + (8 / 64) * 100
LIX = 65.63 + 12.50
LIX = 78.13

**Result:**

LIX = 78.13
