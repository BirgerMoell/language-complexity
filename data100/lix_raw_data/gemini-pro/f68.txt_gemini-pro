**LIX calculation:**

1. Count the number of words in the text: 123
2. Count the number of sentences in the text: 10
3. Count the number of long words in the text (words with more than 6 letters): 52
4. Calculate the LIX score using the formula: LIX = (1 + (long words / sentences)) * (words / sentences)
5. LIX = (1 + (52 / 10)) * (123 / 10) = 18.9

**Result:** LIX=18.9
