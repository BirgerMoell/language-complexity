**LIX calculator**

Here's a quick breakdown of the LIX formula:

LIX = (W/S + L/S) * 100

- **W:** Number of words in the text (excluding particles such as "och", "och", "det", "att")
- **S:** Number of sentences in the text
- **L:** Number of long words (words with more than 6 letters)

**Calculating the LIX score**

1. **Count the number of words:** 122
2. **Count the number of sentences:** 6
3. **Count the number of long words:** 42

**Plugging the values into the formula:**

LIX = ((122 / 6) + (42 / 6)) * 100
LIX = (20.33 + 7) * 100
**LIX = 27.33**

Therefore, the LIX readibility score for the given Swedish text is 27.33.
