**LIX readability score calculation:**

1. **Count the number of words:** 55
2. **Count the number of long words (words with more than 6 letters):** 21
3. **Calculate the average sentence length:** 55 words / 6 sentences = 9.17 words per sentence
4. **Compute the LIX score using this formula:** (25 * number of long words / number of words) + (100 * average sentence length / words per sentence)
    - (25 * 21 / 55) + (100 * 9.17 / 55)
    - 9.64 + 16.69
    - **LIX = 26.33**

Therefore, the LIX readability score for the given Swedish text is **LIX = 26.33**.
