The LIX readability score is calculated using the following formula:

```
LIX = (total number of words / total number of sentences) + (total number of long words / total number of words) * 100
```

**Total number of words:** 42
**Total number of sentences:** 7
**Total number of long words (i.e., words with more than 6 letters):** 19

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

```
LIX = (42 / 7) + (19 / 42) * 100 = 30.14
```

Therefore, the LIX readability score of the text is **LIX = 30.14**.
