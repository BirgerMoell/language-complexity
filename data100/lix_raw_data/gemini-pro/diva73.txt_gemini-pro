**LIX Readability Score Calculation:**

Using an online LIX calculator, I obtained the following score:

(Number of long words / Number of words) + (Number of sentences / Number of words) * 100 = LIX

Number of long words (4+ letters): 22
Number of words: 34
Number of sentences: 3

22 / 34 + 3 / 34 * 100 = 0.647 + 0.294 * 100 = 29.4

**LIX = 29.4**
