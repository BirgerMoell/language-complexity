1. Count the number of words: 60
2. Count the number of sentences: 6
3. Count the number of long words (words with more than 6 letters): 33
4. Calculate the LIX score using the formula: LIX = (Words / Sentences) + (Long words / Words) * 100
5. Plug in the values: LIX = (60 / 6) + (33 / 60) * 100 = 10 + 55 = 65

Therefore, the LIX readability score for the given text is:

**LIX=65**
