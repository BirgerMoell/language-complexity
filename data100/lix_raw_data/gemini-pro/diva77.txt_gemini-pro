**LIX calculation:**

1. Count the number of sentences: 4
2. Count the number of words: 93
3. Count the number of long words (words with more than 6 letters): 60
4. Calculate the LIX score: LIX = (84.6 * number of long words) / (number of words * number of sentences)
5. LIX = (84.6 * 60) / (93 * 4) = **32.16**

**Result:** LIX = 32.16
