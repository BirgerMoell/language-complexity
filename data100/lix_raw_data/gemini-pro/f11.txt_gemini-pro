**Number of words:** 56
**Number of characters (spaces included):** 465
**Number of characters (spaces excluded):** 348
**Number of sentences:** 7
**LIX calculation:**

LIX = (100 ÷ number of words) × ((number of characters × number of sentences) ÷ number of words²))

LIX = (100 ÷ 56) × ((348 × 7) ÷ 56²)
LIX = (1.7857) × (2436 ÷ 3136)
LIX = (1.7857) × (0.777)
**LIX = 1.38**
