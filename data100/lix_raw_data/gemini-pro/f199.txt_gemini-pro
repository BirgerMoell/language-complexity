**To calculate the LIX readability score:**

1. Count the number of words in the text: There are 76 words in the text.
2. Count the number of long words (words with more than six letters): There are 22 long words in the text.
3. Calculate the average sentence length by dividing the number of words by the number of sentences: There are 10 sentences in the text, so the average sentence length is 76 / 10 = 7.6 words.
4. Plug these values into the LIX formula: LIX = 0.14 * ASL + 0.06 * AWL + 30
   - ASL = average sentence length = 7.6 words
   - AWL = average word length = 22 long words / 76 words = 0.29
   - LIX = 0.14 * 7.6 + 0.06 * 0.29 + 30 = 34.35

Therefore, the LIX readability score of the text is **LIX=34.35**.
