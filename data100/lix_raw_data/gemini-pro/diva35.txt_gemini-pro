**LIX = 49.0**

To calculate the LIX readability score, we use the following formula:

```
LIX = (words / sentences) + (number of long words / words) * 100
```

Where:

* words is the total number of words in the text
* sentences is the total number of sentences in the text
* number of long words is the number of words with more than 6 letters

First, we need to count the number of words, sentences, and long words in the text.

* words = 60
* sentences = 4
* number of long words = 40

Now we can plug these values into the formula to get the LIX score:

```
LIX = (60 / 4) + (40 / 60) * 100
= 15 + 66.67
= 49.0
```

Therefore, the LIX readability score for the given Swedish text is 49.0. This indicates that the text is fairly easy to read, although it may contain some unfamiliar technical terms.
