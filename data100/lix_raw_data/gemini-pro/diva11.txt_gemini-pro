* Each word is assigned a value of 1 if it contains less than 6 letters, and 2 if it contains 6 or more letters.
* The average number of words per sentence is calculated.
* The sum of the word values is divided by the average number of words per sentence.

In this text, there are 53 words and 4 sentences.

* Words with less than 6 letters: 30
* Words with 6 or more letters: 23

Sum of word values: 30 + 23 x 2 = 76

Average number of words per sentence: 53 / 4 = 13.25

LIX score: 76 / 13.25 = **36.98**

Therefore, the LIX readability score of the text is: LIX=36.98
