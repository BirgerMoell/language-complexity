**LIX Calculator:**

The LIX calculator takes the number of words, characters, sentences, and polysyllables into account to compute a score.

```
LIX = (Words / Sentences) + ((Polysyllables / Words) * 100)
```

**Calculation:**

```
LIX = (79 / 10) + ((13 / 79) * 100)
    = 7.9 + 16.46
    = **24.36**
```

**Result:**

LIX = 24.36
