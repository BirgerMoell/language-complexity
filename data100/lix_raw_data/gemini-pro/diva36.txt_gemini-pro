**LIX calculation:**

1. Count the number of words (including punctuation).
2. Count the number of long words (words with at least 6 letters).
3. Calculate the LIX score using the formula: LIX = ( 39 * Number of long words ) / Number of words
4. Round the result to the nearest integer.

In this text:

- Number of words: 77
- Number of long words: 22
- LIX score: ( 39 * 22 ) / 77 = 10.25641
- Rounded LIX score: 10

**Result:**
LIX = 10
