**Step 1: Count the number of words, sentences, and long words.**

* Number of words: 40
* Number of sentences: 5
* Number of long words (more than 6 letters): 16

**Step 2: Calculate the LIX score using the formula: LIX = (Number of words / Number of sentences) + 100 * (Number of long words / Number of words)**

LIX = (40 / 5) + 100 * (16 / 40)
LIX = 8 + 40
**LIX = 48**
