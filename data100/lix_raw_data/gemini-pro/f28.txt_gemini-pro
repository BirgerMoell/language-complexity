**LIX Readability Score Calculation:**

The LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability formula is:

```
LIX = (Number of words / Number of sentences) + (Number of long words / Number of words) x 100
```

**Calculating the LIX score:**

1. Number of words: 14
2. Number of sentences: 1
3. Number of long words (more than 6 letters): 6

```
LIX = (14 / 1) + (6 / 14) x 100
LIX = 14 + 42.857
LIX = 56.857
```

**Result:**

LIX = 56.857
