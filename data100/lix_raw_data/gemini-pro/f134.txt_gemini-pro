**Step 1: Count the words, sentences, and long words.**

* Words: 38
* Sentences: 4
* Long words (7 characters or more): 17

**Step 2: Calculate the LIX score.**

LIX = (Number of long words / Number of sentences) * (Number of sentences / Number of words) * 100

LIX = ((17 / 4) * (4 / 38)) * 100
LIX = **37.89**

Therefore, the LIX readability score for the text is: **LIX=37.89.**
