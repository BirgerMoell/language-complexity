**LIX calculation:**

1. Count the number of words in the text: 51
2. Count the number of long words (words with more than 6 letters): 29
3. Calculate LIX using the formula: LIX = (words/sentences) + (long words/words) * 100

In this case, there is 1 sentence and 51 words, so:

LIX = (51/1) + (29/51) * 100
LIX = 51 + 56.86
**LIX = 107.86**

Therefore, the LIX readability score for the given Swedish text is 107.86.
