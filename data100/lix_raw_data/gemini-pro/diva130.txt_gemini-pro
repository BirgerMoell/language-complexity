**LIX Calculation:**

1. Count the number of words (excluding particles): 58
2. Count the number of long words (more than 6 letters): 43
3. Calculate the average sentence length (number of words divided by number of sentences): 58 / 4 = 14.5

**LIX Formula:**

```
LIX = (0.0579 * number of long words) + (0.0318 * average sentence length)
```

**Result:**

```
LIX = (0.0579 * 43) + (0.0318 * 14.5)
LIX = 2.49 + 0.46
LIX = **3.0**
```

Therefore, the LIX readability score for the given Swedish text is **3.0**.
