The LIX readibility score is calculated using the following formula:

LIX = (number of words / number of sentences) + (number of complex words / number of words) * 100

To calculate the number of words, we count all the words in the text, including prepositions, conjunctions, and articles.

To calculate the number of sentences, we count the number of periods, question marks, and exclamation points in the text.

To calculate the number of complex words, we count the number of words that have more than 6 letters (excluding words that end in "s", "t", "d", or "e").

**Calculating the LIX score for the given text:**

Number of words = 155
Number of sentences = 6
Number of complex words = 40

LIX = ((155 / 6) + ((40 / 155) * 100))
LIX = (25.83 + 25.81)
LIX = 51.64

**Result:**

LIX = 51.64
