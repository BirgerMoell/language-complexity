**Step 1: Calculate sentence length (L)**

Count the number of words in each sentence, including punctuation.

Sentence 1: 13 words
Sentence 2: 14 words
Sentence 3: 24 words

**Step 2: Calculate word length (G)**

Divide the total number of letters in the text by the total number of words.

(60 letters) / (41 words) = 1.46 letters per word

**Step 3: Calculate LIX**

Use the formula: LIX = 0.64L + 0.024G

LIX = 0.64(13) + 0.024(1.46) = **9.48**

**Result:**

LIX = 9.48
