The LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score is calculated as follows:
1. Count the total number of words in the text.
2. Count the total number of long words (words with more than 6 letters).
3. Count the total number of sentences.
4. Calculate the average length of a sentence by dividing the total number of words by the total number of sentences.
5. Calculate the LIX score using the following formula: LIX = ((number of long words + number of sentences) / total number of words) * 100

Using this formula, we can calculate the LIX score for the provided Swedish text as follows:

1. Total number of words: 82
2. Total number of long words: 29
3. Total number of sentences: 6
4. Average length of a sentence: 82 / 6 = 13.7
5. LIX score: ((29 + 6) / 82) * 100 = 42.7

**LIX = 42.7**
