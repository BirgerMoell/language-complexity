**LIX calculation:**

1. Number of words: 55
2. Number of long words (more than 6 letters): 33
3. Number of sentences: 5
4. LIX = (Number of long words / Number of words) * 100 + (Number of sentences / Number of words) * 100
5. LIX = (33 / 55) * 100 + (5 / 55) * 100
6. LIX = 60 + 9.09
7. LIX = 69.09

**Result:**
LIX = 69.09
