**1. Count the number of words in the text.**
The text has 69 words.

**2. Count the number of long words (words with more than 6 letters).**
The text has 36 long words.

**3. Compute the LIX score using the formula: LIX = (Words / Sentences) + (Long words / Words) * 100**
- Number of sentences: 4
- Number of words: 69
- Number of long words: 36

LIX = (69 / 4) + (36 / 69) * 100
LIX = 17.25 + 52.17
**LIX = 69.42**
