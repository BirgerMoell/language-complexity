**LIX analysis**

To calculate the LIX readability score, we need to count the following:

* Number of words in the text (ords)
* Number of long words (longwords)
* Number of sentences in the text (sents)

**Results:**

* ords = 101
* longwords = 12 (words with more than 6 letters)
* sents = 8

**Formula:**

```
LIX = (ords/sents) + (longwords/ords) * 100
```

**Calculation:**

```
LIX = (101/8) + (12/101) * 100
LIX = 12.625 + 11.881
LIX = 24.506
```

**Rounded to two decimal places:**

```
LIX = 24.51
```

**Result:**

LIX = 24.51
