**Step 1: Count the number of words, sentences, and syllables.**

- Words: 76
- Sentences: 7
- Syllables: 143

**Step 2: Calculate the Average Number of Words per Sentence (AWS)**

AWS = Total number of words / Total number of sentences
AWS = 76 / 7
AWS = 10.86

**Step 3: Calculate the Average Number of Syllables per Word (ASW)**

ASW = Total number of syllables / Total number of words
ASW = 143 / 76
ASW = 1.88

**Step 4: Calculate the LIX Readability Score**

LIX = AWS + ASW - 3
LIX = 10.86 + 1.88 - 3
**LIX = 9.74**
