**Analysis**

The LIX readability index takes into account the average word length, the number of words per sentence, and the number of subclauses per sentence.

**Average word length**

The average word length is calculated by dividing the total number of letters in the text by the total number of words. In this text, there are 286 letters and 63 words, giving an average word length of 286/63 = 4.54.

**Number of words per sentence**

The number of words per sentence is calculated by dividing the total number of words by the total number of sentences. In this text, there are 63 words and 5 sentences, giving an average of 63/5 = 12.6 words per sentence.

**Number of subclauses per sentence**

The number of subclauses per sentence is calculated by counting the number of subordinate clauses and dividing by the total number of sentences. In this text, there are 2 subordinate clauses and 5 sentences, giving an average of 2/5 = 0.4 subclauses per sentence.

**LIX score**

The LIX score is calculated using the following formula:

LIX = (average word length + number of words per sentence) * number of subclauses per sentence

Plugging in the values we calculated above, we get:

LIX = (4.54 + 12.6) * 0.4 = 6.8

Therefore, the LIX readability score for this text is **LIX=6.8**.
