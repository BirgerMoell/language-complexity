To calculate the LIX readability score, we need to count the following:

* Number of words in the sentence (w)
* Number of words consisting of more than 6 letters (l)
* Number of sentences (s)

In this text, we have:

* w = 61
* l = 27
* s = 3

Using the formula: LIX = (w/s) + (l/s)*100, we get:

LIX = (61/3) + (27/3)*100
LIX = 20.33 + 900
LIX = 920.33

Therefore, the LIX readability score for the text is **LIX=920.33**.
