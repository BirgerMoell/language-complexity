**Calculating the LIX readability score**

1. Count the number of words in the text.
2. Count the number of long words (words with more than 6 letters).
3. Count the number of sentences in the text.
4. Calculate the average number of long words per sentence: Long words / Sentences
5. Calculate the LIX score: LIX = Average long words per sentence + Percentage of long words.

**Applying the formula to the text**

1. Number of words: 90
2. Number of long words: 56
3. Number of sentences: 6
4. Average long words per sentence: 56 / 6 = 9.33
5. Percentage of long words: 56 / 90 * 100 = 62.22%

**LIX score**

LIX = 9.33 + 62.22 = **71.55**
