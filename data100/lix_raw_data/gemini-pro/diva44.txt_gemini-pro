**Step 1: Count the number of words and long words**

* Number of words: 29
* Number of long words (with more than 6 letters): 16

**Step 2: Calculate the ratio of long words to words**

* Ratio = Number of long words / Number of words
* Ratio = 16 / 29 = 0.55

**Step 3: Calculate the percentage of sentences with more than 15 words**

* Number of sentences: 3
* Number of sentences with more than 15 words: 0

**Step 4: Compute the LIX score**

* LIX = Ratio of long words to words + Percentage of sentences with more than 15 words
* LIX = 0.55 + 0 = **0.55**

**Result:**

LIX=0.55
