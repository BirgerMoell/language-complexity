**Analysis:**

The text contains:

* 113 words
* 19 sentences
* 756 characters (including spaces)
* 339 characters (excluding spaces)

**LIX Calculation:**

LIX = (Words / Sentences) + ((Characters excluding spaces) / Words) * 100

LIX = (113 / 19) + ((339 / 113) * 100)

LIX = 5.95 + 29.91

**LIX = 35.86**

**Explanation:**

* The word count is divided by the sentence count to get the average number of words per sentence.
* The character count excluding spaces is divided by the word count to get the average number of characters per word.
* These two values are summed and multiplied by 100 to get the LIX score.

**Result:**

LIX = 35.86
