**Step 2: Count the number of long words.**
Long words are words with more than 6 letters.

**Step 4: Calculate the LIX score.**
LIX = (Long word count / Word count) * 100 + (Sentence count / Word count) * 100
LIX = (22 / 67) * 100 + (7 / 67) * 100
LIX = 32.83582089552238 + 10.44776119402985
LIX = 43.28358208955224

**Result:**
