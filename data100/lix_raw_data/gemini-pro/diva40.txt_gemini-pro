**Steps to Calculate LIX Score:**

1. Count the number of words (not including numbers or punctuation): 89
2. Count the number of long words (6 letters or more): 31
3. Count the number of sentences: 6

**LIX Formula:** (Number of long words / Number of words) x 100 + (Number of sentences / Number of words) x 100

**Calculation:**
- (31 / 89) x 100 = 34.83
- (6 / 89) x 100 = 6.74
- 34.83 + 6.74 = 41.57

**Result:**
LIX = 41.57
