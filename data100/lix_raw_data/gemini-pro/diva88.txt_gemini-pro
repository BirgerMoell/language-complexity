**LIX readability score calculator:**

1. Count the number of words in the text: 52
2. Count the number of sentences in the text: 7
3. Count the number of long words (with more than 6 letters): 22
4. Calculate LIX using the formula: LIX = (words/sentences) + (long words/sentences) * 100
5. Calculate: LIX = 52/7 + 22/7 * 100 = 7.43 + 31.43
6. Round the result to the nearest integer: LIX = 39

**Result:**

LIX = 39
