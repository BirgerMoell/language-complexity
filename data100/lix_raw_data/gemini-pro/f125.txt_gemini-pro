**LIX calculation:**

1. Count the number of words in the text: 80
2. Count the number of long words (words with more than 6 letters): 28
3. Count the number of complex sentences (sentences with more than 2 subordinate clauses): 2
4. Calculate the LIX score using the formula: `LIX = (100 * number of long words) / number of words + (100 * number of complex sentences) / number of words`

`LIX = (100 * 28) / 80 + (100 * 2) / 80`
`LIX = 35 + 2.5`
`LIX = 37.5`

**Result:**
LIX = 37.5
