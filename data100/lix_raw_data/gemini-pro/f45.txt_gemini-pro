**Steps to compute the LIX readability score:**

1. Count the number of words in the text.
2. Count the number of long words (words with more than 6 letters).
3. Count the number of sentences in the text.
4. Calculate LIX as follows: LIX = (100 * number of long words) / number of words) + (number of sentences / number of words).
5. Calculate the final LIX score to the nearest integer.

**Applying these steps to the given Swedish text:**

1. Number of words: 90
2. Number of long words: 16
3. Number of sentences: 4
4. LIX = (100 * 16) / 90) + (4 / 90) = 17.78 + 0.04 = 17.82
5. Final LIX score: 18

**Result:** LIX=18
