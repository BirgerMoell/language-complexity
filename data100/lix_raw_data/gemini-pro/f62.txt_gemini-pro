**Lexile Index (LIX)** measures the readability level of a text by calculating the average number of words per sentence and syllables per word. The formula for calculating LIX is:

```
LIX = (Words / Sentences) + (Syllables / Words)
```

**Calculating the LIX score for the Swedish text:**

**Counting words and sentences:**

There are 56 words and 5 sentences in the text.

**Words / Sentences:** 56 / 5 = 11.2

**Counting syllables:**

There are 94 syllables in total.

**Syllables / Words:** 94 / 56 = 1.68

**Calculating the LIX score:**

LIX = 11.2 + 1.68 = 12.88

**Result:**

LIX = 12.88
