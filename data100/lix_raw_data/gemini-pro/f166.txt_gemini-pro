1. **Count the number of words in the text.**

There are 102 words in the text.

2. **Count the number of long words in the text.**

A long word is a word that has more than 6 letters.

There are 50 long words in the text.

3. **Calculate the average sentence length.**

The average sentence length is the total number of words in the text divided by the number of sentences in the text.

There are 5 sentences in the text, so the average sentence length is 102 / 5 = 20.4 words.

4. **Calculate the LIX readability score.**

The LIX readability score is calculated using the following formula:

```
LIX = (Average sentence length + Percentage of long words) * 0.5
```

The percentage of long words is the number of long words in the text divided by the total number of words in the text, multiplied by 100.

In this case, the percentage of long words is 50 / 102 * 100 = 49%.

So, the LIX readability score is:

```
LIX = (20.4 + 49) * 0.5 = 34.7
```

Therefore, the LIX readability score for the given Swedish text is **LIX=34.7**.
