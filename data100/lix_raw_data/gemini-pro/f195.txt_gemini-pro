**Analysis:**

* **Number of words:** 56
* **Number of sentences:** 5
* **Number of complex sentences:** 1

**LIX Calculation:**
```
LIX = (WS + WS²) / S
```

where:

* WS = Number of words
* S = Number of sentences

```
LIX = (56 + √56²) / 5
= (56 + √3136) / 5
= (56 + 56) / 5
= 112 / 5
= 22.4
```

**Result:**
```
LIX = 22.4
```
