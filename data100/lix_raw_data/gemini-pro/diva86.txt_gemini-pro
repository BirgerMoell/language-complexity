**Calculating the LIX readability score:**

1. Count the number of words in the text: 64
2. Count the number of long words (with more than 6 letters): 42
3. Count the number of sentences: 4

**Formula for LIX readability score:**

```
LIX = (Words / Sentences) + (Long words / Sentences) * 100
```

**Calculation:**

```
LIX = (64 / 4) + (42 / 4) * 100
LIX = 16 + 1050
LIX = 1066
```

**Result:**

LIX = 1066
