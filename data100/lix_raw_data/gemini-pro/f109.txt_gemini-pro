**LIX readibility score**

The LIX formula is: LIX = (Nwords / Nsentences) + (100 * Nlongwords / Nwords)

**Calculating the LIX score**

1. Count the number of words (Nwords) in the text: 131
2. Count the number of sentences (Nsentences) in the text: 2
3. Count the number of long words (Nlongwords) in the text. A long word is defined as a word with more than 6 letters: 64
4. Plug the values into the formula: LIX = (131 / 2) + (100 * 64 / 131) = 65.5 + 48.8 = **114.3**

**Result**

LIX = 114.3
