**Analysis:**

The text contains 145 words and 902 characters, including spaces.

**LIX Calculation:**

LIX = (words / sentences) + (characters / words) * 100
Sentences = 4 (defined by full stops)

LIX = (145 / 4) + (902 / 145) * 100
LIX = 36.25 + 622.07 * 100
LIX = 36.25 + 62207
LIX = 62243.25

**Result:**

LIX = 62243.2
