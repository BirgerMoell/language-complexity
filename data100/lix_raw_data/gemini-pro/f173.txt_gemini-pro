**Analysis:**

The Swedish text consists of 90 words and 512 characters, including spaces.

**LIX Readability Score Calculation:**

The LIX readability score is calculated using the following formula:

```
LIX = Average number of words per sentence + Percentage of long words
```

**Average number of words per sentence:**

There are 4 sentences in the text:

* Sentence 1: 30 words
* Sentence 2: 25 words
* Sentence 3: 21 words
* Sentence 4: 14 words

Average number of words per sentence = (30 + 25 + 21 + 14) / 4 = 22.5

**Percentage of long words:**

A long word is defined as a word with at least 6 letters.

There are 15 long words in the text, out of a total of 90 words:

* den (4)
* ljusa (6)
* stenbotten (10)
* cirklade (9)
* verkade (7)
* tydligen (8)
* svängande (9)

* utan (5)
* smaka (6)
* måste (7)
* används (8)
* list (4)
* tänkte (7)
* undan (6)
* närmade (8)

Percentage of long words = (15 / 90) x 100 = 16.7%

**LIX Readability Score:**

LIX = 22.5 + 16.7 = **39.2**

**Result:**

LIX = 39.2
