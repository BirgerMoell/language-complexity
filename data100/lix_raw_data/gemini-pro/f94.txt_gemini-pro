**LIX Calculator**

Number of words: 56
Number of sentences: 7
Number of long words (more than 6 letters): 13

**Calculations**

```
LIX = (Number of words / Number of sentences) + (Number of long words / Number of words)* 100

LIX = (56 / 7) + (13 / 56)* 100
LIX = 8 + 23.214
LIX = 31.214
```

**Result**

LIX = 31.214
