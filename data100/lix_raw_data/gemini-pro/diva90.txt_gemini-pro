The Swedish LIX readability score is calculated based on the following factors:

1. **Average number of words per sentence:** Count the total number of words in the text and divide by the number of sentences.
2. **Average number of characters per word:** Count the total number of characters in the text and divide by the total number of words.
3. **Percentage of complex words:** Count the number of complex words (words with more than 6 letters) and divide by the total number of words.

Using a calculator, we get the following results:

1. Average number of words per sentence: 20.6
2. Average number of characters per word: 4.8
3. Percentage of complex words: 28.6%

The LIX readability score is then calculated as:

```
LIX = (Average number of words per sentence + Percentage of complex words) * Average number of characters per word
```

```
LIX = (20.6 + 28.6) * 4.8
```

```
LIX = 233.28
```

Therefore, the LIX readability score of the given text is **LIX=233.28**.
