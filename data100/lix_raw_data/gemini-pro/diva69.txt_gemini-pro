**Number of words:** 53
**Number of sentences:** 5
**Number of long words (more than 6 letters):** 19
**LIX calculation:**
`LIX = 31 + 0.05(W + L)/S`

where 
`W` is the number of words in the text
`L` is the number of long words
`S` is the number of sentences

`LIX = 31 + 0.05(53 + 19)/5`
`LIX = 31 + 0.05(72)/5`
`LIX = 31 + 0.05(14.4)`
`LIX = 31 + 0.72`
`LIX = 31.72`

**Result:**
LIX = 31.72
