**LIX readability score calculation:**

1. Count the total number of words in the text: 88
2. Count the total number of long words (words with more than 6 letters): 49
3. Count the total number of sentences in the text: 13
4. Calculate the LIX score using the formula: LIX = (words / sentences) + (long words / sentences) * 100
5. Plug in the numbers: LIX = (88 / 13) + (49 / 13) * 100 = 53.08

**Result:** LIX = 53.08
