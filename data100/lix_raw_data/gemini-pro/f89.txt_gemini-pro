**LIX readability score**

The LIX readability score is a measure of the readability of a text. It is calculated by taking into account the average number of words per sentence, the average number of letters per word, and the number of unfamiliar words in the text.

**To calculate the LIX score, you need to:**

1. Count the number of words in the text.
2. Count the number of letters in the text.
3. Count the number of sentences in the text.
4. Count the number of unfamiliar words in the text.
5. Calculate the average number of words per sentence by dividing the number of words by the number of sentences.
6. Calculate the average number of letters per word by dividing the number of letters by the number of words.
7. Calculate the number of unfamiliar words per 100 words by dividing the number of unfamiliar words by the number of words and multiplying by 100.
8. Multiply the average number of words per sentence by 0.5.
9. Multiply the average number of letters per word by 0.075.
10. Multiply the number of unfamiliar words per 100 words by 0.125.
11. Add the three values together.
12. Subtract 3.5 from the total.

**The result is the LIX score.**

**For the given Swedish text, we get the following results:**

* Number of words: 65
* Number of letters: 389
* Number of sentences: 4
* Number of unfamiliar words: 12
* Average number of words per sentence: 65 / 4 = 16.25
* Average number of letters per word: 389 / 65 = 6.0
* Number of unfamiliar words per 100 words: 12 / 65 * 100 = 18.46
* 0.5 * 16.25 = 8.125
* 0.075 * 6.0 = 0.45
* 0.125 * 18.46 = 2.31
* 8.125 + 0.45 + 2.31 = 10.885
* 10.885 - 3.5 = 7.385

**Therefore, the LIX score for the given Swedish text is LIX=7.385.**
