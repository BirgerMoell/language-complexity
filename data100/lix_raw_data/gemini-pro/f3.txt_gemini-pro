**Calculate the LIX readability score:**

1. Count the number of words: 72
2. Count the number of long words (with 6 letters or more): 27
3. Count the number of sentences: 5

**Formula:** LIX = (number of long words / number of words) * 100 + (number of sentences / number of words) * 200
**Plugging in the values:** LIX = (27 / 72) * 100 + (5 / 72) * 200 = 47.22 + 13.89 = **61.11**

**Result:** LIX=61.11
