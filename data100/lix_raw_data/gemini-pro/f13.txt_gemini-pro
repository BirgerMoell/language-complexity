**LIX readability score calculation:**

**1. Count the number of words:** 37
**2. Count the number of words with more than 6 letters:** 13
**3. Count the number of sentences:** 5
**4. Calculate the LIX score:** LIX = (Number of words with more than 6 letters / Number of words) * 100 + (Number of sentences / Number of words) * 100
LIX = (13 / 37) * 100 + (5 / 37) * 100
LIX = 35.14 + 13.51
LIX = 48.65

**Result:** LIX=49
