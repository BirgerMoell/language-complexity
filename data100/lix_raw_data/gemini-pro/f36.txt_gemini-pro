**Steps to Calculate LIX:**

1. Count the total number of words: 102
2. Count the total number of sentences: 5
3. Count the number of words with more than 6 letters: 51

**Formula:**

```
LIX = (Average sentence length x Percentage of words with 6+ letters) / 44
```

**Calculation:**

* Average sentence length: 102 words / 5 sentences = 20.4 words
* Percentage of words with 6+ letters: 51 / 102 words * 100 = 50%

**LIX Score:**

```
LIX = (20.4 x 50) / 44 = 23.4
```

**Result:**

LIX = 23.4
