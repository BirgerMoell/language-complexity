**Analysis:**

The text contains 94 words, 10 sentences, and 700 characters (including spaces). The LIX readability formula is calculated as follows:

```
LIX = (number of long words / number of words) * 100
```

**Calculation:**

Number of long words (more than 6 characters): 69
Number of words: 94

```
LIX = (69 / 94) * 100
```

```
LIX = 73.4
```

**Result:**

LIX=73.4
