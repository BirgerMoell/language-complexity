**LIX Calculator Results:**

* Number of words: 47
* Number of long words (5+ letters): 26
* Average sentence length (words per sentence): 15.67

**LIX Score Calculation:**

LIX = (Number of long words / Number of words) * 100 + (Average sentence length - 10)

LIX = (26 / 47) * 100 + (15.67 - 10)
LIX = 55.32 + 5.67
**LIX = 60.99**

Therefore, the LIX readability score for the given Swedish text is 60.99.
