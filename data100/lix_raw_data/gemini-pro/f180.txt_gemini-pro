**LIX readability score calculation**

1. **Count the number of words and sentences in the text.**
* Words: 53
* Sentences: 6

2. **Count the number of long words (words with more than 6 letters) in the text.**
* Long words: 25

3. **Calculate the LIX score using the formula:**
* LIX = (words / sentences) + (long words / words) * 100
* LIX = (53 / 6) + (25 / 53) * 100
* LIX = 8.83 + 47.17
* LIX = **56**

**Result**

LIX = 56
