The LIX formula is: LIX = (words / sentences) + ((characters / words) * 100)

**1. Count the words and sentences:**

* Words: 83
* Sentences: 4

**2. Calculate the ratio of words to sentences:**

* Words / sentences = 83 / 4 = 20.75

**3. Count the characters and calculate the ratio of characters to words:**

* Characters: 542
* Characters / words = 542 / 83 = 6.51

**4. Plug the values into the LIX formula:**

* LIX = (20.75) + ((6.51) * 100)
* LIX = 20.75 + 65.1
* LIX = 85.85

**Result:**

LIX = 85.85
