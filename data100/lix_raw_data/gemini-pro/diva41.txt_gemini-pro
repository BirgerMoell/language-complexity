**Calculating the LIX score:**

1. Count the number of long words (words with more than 6 letters) per 100 words: 52 long words in 200 words = 26 long words per 100 words.
2. Count the number of sentences per 100 words: 12 sentences in 200 words = 6 sentences per 100 words.
3. Calculate the average number of words per sentence: 200 words / 12 sentences = 16.67 words per sentence.

**LIX formula:**

LIX = (long words / 100 words) + (sentences / 100 words) + (average words per sentence) -1

**Result:**

LIX = (26 / 100) + (6 / 100) + (16.67 - 1)
LIX = 0.26 + 0.06 + 15.67
**LIX = 15.99**
