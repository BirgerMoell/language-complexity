**LIX calculator**

**Number of words (excluding stop words):** 58
**Number of sentences:** 7
**Number of long words (7 letters or more):** 10

**LIX = (Number of words / Number of sentences) + (Percentage of long words * 100) / Number of sentences**

**LIX = (58 / 7) + (10 / 7 * 100) = 20.86**

**Result: LIX = 20.86**
