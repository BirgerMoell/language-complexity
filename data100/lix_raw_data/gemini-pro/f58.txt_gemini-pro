**LIX score calculation:**

1. **Count the total number of letters in the text.** Be sure to exclude spaces, punctuation marks, and numbers. The number of letters in the given text is 596.
2. **Count the total number of words in the text.** The number of words in the given text is 107.
3. **Count the total number of long words in the text.** A long word is defined as a word with at least six letters. The number of long words in the given text is 34.
4. **Compute the LIX score using the following formula:**
```
LIX = (A * 100) / B
```
where:

* A = the number of long words in the text
* B = the total number of words in the text

```
LIX = (34 * 100) / 107 = 31.78
```

**Result:**

LIX=31.78
