**Analysis**

* Number of words: 49
* Number of long words (more than 6 letters): 19
* Number of sentences: 5

**LIX calculation**

LIX = (Number of words / Number of sentences) + (Number of long words / Number of sentences) * 100

LIX = (49 / 5) + (19 / 5) * 100
LIX = 9.8 + 38 * 100
LIX = 9.8 + 3800
**LIX = 3809.8**

**Result**

LIX = 3809.8
