**LIX readability score calculation:**

The LIX readability score is a measure of the readability of a text based on its average word length and the number of polysyllabic words (words with three or more syllables) per sentence.

**Average word length:**

* Number of words in the text: 44
* Number of characters in the text (excluding spaces): 272
* Average word length: 272 / 44 = 6.18

**Number of polysyllabic words per sentence:**

* Number of sentences in the text: 4
* Number of polysyllabic words in the text: 6
* Number of polysyllabic words per sentence: 6 / 4 = 1.5

**LIX score:**

The LIX score is calculated as the sum of the average word length and the number of polysyllabic words per sentence.

LIX = Average word length + Number of polysyllabic words per sentence
LIX = 6.18 + 1.5
**LIX = 7.68**

**Interpretation:**

A LIX score of 7.68 indicates that the text is relatively difficult to read. It is likely to be more suitable for readers with a higher level of education.
