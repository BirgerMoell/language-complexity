**Analysis:**

The Swedish text contains the following number of:

* Sentences: 7
* Words: 95
* Long words (with more than 6 letters): 58

**LIX readability score calculation:**

Using a LIX calculator, we get the following formula:

```
LIX = ( (Sentences / Words) * 100 ) + ( (Long words / Words) * 100 ) 
```

Plugging in our values:

```
LIX = ( (7 / 95) * 100 ) + ( (58 / 95) * 100 )
```

```
LIX = (7.36 * 100) + (61.05 * 100)
```

```
LIX = 736 + 6105
```

```
LIX = 6841
```

**Result:**

LIX = 6841
