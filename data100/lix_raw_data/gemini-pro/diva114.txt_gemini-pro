**Calculating the LIX readability score:**

1. Count the number of words in the text: 72
2. Count the number of long words (with 6 or more letters): 29
3. Count the number of sentences: 1

**LIX score = (Number of long words / Number of words) * 100 + Number of sentences**

**LIX score = (29 / 72) * 100 + 1 = 44**

**Result: LIX=44**
