**LIX calculation:**

1. Count the number of sentences: 6
2. Count the number of words with at least 6 letters: 51
3. Count the number of words in total: 141

**LIX formula:**

```
LIX = (0.05 * number of words with at least 6 letters) + (0.8 * number of sentences / number of words)
```

**LIX calculation:**

```
LIX = (0.05 * 51) + (0.8 * 6 / 141)
= 2.55 + 0.33
= 2.88
```

**Result:**

```
LIX=2.88
