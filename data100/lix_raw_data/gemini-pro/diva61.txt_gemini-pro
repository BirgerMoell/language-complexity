1. Count the number of words in the text: 73
2. Count the number of long words (words with more than six letters): 26
3. Count the number of complex sentences (sentences with more than 20 words): 0

**Formula:**

LIX = (75 * number of long words) / (number of words - number of complex sentences)

**Calculation:**

LIX = (75 * 26) / (73 - 0) = 29.73

**Result:**

LIX = 29.73
