**Readability Analysis:**

1. **Count the total number of words:** 115
2. **Count the number of complete sentences:** 8
3. **Calculate the average sentence length:** 115 words / 8 sentences = 14.375 words per sentence

**LIX Readability Score Calculation:**

LIX = (Average sentence length + (Percentage of long words / 100)) * 0.06
- **Percentage of long words:** A long word is defined as having more than 6 letters. Count the number of long words in the text and divide by the total number of words: (25 / 115) * 100 = 21.74%

LIX = (14.375 + (21.74 / 100)) * 0.06
LIX = 14.59

**Result:**

LIX = 14.59
