**LIX calculation:**

* **Number of words:** 57
* **Number of long words (more than 6 letters):** 25
* **Number of sentences:** 6
* **Average sentence length (words per sentence):** 57/6 = 9.5

**LIX formula:**

```
LIX = (Number of long words / Number of words) * 100 + (Number of sentences / Number of words) * 100
```

**LIX score:**

```
LIX = (25 / 57) * 100 + (6 / 57) * 100
LIX = 43.86 + 10.53
LIX = 54.39
```

**Result:**

LIX=54.39
