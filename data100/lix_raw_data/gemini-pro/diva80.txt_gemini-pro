**Calculating the LIX Readability Score**

The LIX formula is: LIX = (A + B) / C * 100

where:
- A = Number of long words (with more than 6 letters)
- B = Number of sentences
- C = Number of words

**Analysis of the Text**

- **Number of words (C):** 65
- **Number of sentences (B):** 4
- **Number of long words (A):** 26

**Calculation**

LIX = (26 + 4) / 65 * 100
LIX = 30 / 65 * 100
LIX = 46.1538

**Result**

LIX = 46.15
