2. Count the number of sentences in the text: 4
3. Count the number of long words (words with more than 6 letters): 31

**LIX formula:**

```
LIX = (Long words / Words) * 100 + (Sentences / Words) * 100
```

**LIX score:**

```
LIX = (31 / 48) * 100 + (4 / 48) * 100 = 64.58
```

**Result:**

LIX=64.58
