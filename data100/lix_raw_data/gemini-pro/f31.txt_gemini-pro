To compute the LIX readability score, a calculator is required.

**Formula:** LIX = (Number of words/(Number of sentences + Number of long words)) * 100

**Long words:** Words with more than 6 letters

**Step 1: Count the number of words, sentences, and long words**

- Words: 71
- Sentences: 4
- Long words: 45

**Step 2: Substitute the values into the formula**

LIX = (71 / (4 + 45)) * 100
LIX = (71 / 49) * 100
LIX = 1.45 * 100
LIX = 145

**Result:** LIX = 145
