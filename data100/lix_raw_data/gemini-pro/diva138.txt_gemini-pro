The LIX readability index is a measure of the complexity of a text. The index is based on the number of characters per word, the number of polysyllabic words (words with more than three syllables), and the number of sentences per 100 words.

To calculate the LIX readability score, you can use the following formula:

```
LIX = (Chars / Words) + (Polys / Words) - (Sentences / 100)
```

Here's how to calculate the LIX readability score for the given Swedish text:

1. Count the number of characters in the text: 167
2. Count the number of words in the text: 29
3. Count the number of polysyllabic words in the text: 7
4. Count the number of sentences in the text: 1
5. Plug these numbers into the formula:

```
LIX = (167 / 29) + (7 / 29) - (1 / 100) = 5.88
```

Therefore, the LIX readability score for the given Swedish text is:

```
LIX = 5.88
```
