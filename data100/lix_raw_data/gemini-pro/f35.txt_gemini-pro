**LIX Calculation:**

The LIX readability score is calculated using the following formula:

```
LIX = (Words / Sentences) + (100 * LongWords / Words)
```

**Step 1: Count Words and Sentences**

* Words = 68
* Sentences = 6

**Step 2: Count Long Words**

A long word is defined as having more than 6 letters.

* LongWords = 32

**Step 3: Calculate LIX Score**

```
LIX = (68 / 6) + (100 * 32 / 68)
LIX = 11.33 + 47.06
LIX = 58.39
```

**Result:**

LIX = 58.39
