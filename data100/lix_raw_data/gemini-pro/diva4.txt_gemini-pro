**Calculation of LIX readability score:**

The LIX formula is: LIX = (Nws + Nls) / Nwords x 100

where:
* Nws = number of words
* Nls = number of long words
* Nwords = Nws + Nls

**Analysis of the text:**

* Number of words (Nwords) = 57
* Number of long words (Nls) = 23 (words with 6 or more letters)

**Score:**

LIX = (23 + 34) / 57 x 100 = **45.61**

**Result:**

LIX = 45.61
