**Steps to compute LIX readability score:**

1. Count the number of words: 34
2. Count the number of long words (with more than 6 letters): 13
3. Count the number of sentences: 3

**Formula for LIX:**

```
LIX = (Number of words / Number of sentences) + (Percentage of long words * 100)
```

**Calculation:**

```
LIX = (34 / 3) + (13 / 34 * 100)
```
```
LIX = 11.33 + 38.24
```
```
LIX = 49.57
```

**Result:**
LIX=49.57
