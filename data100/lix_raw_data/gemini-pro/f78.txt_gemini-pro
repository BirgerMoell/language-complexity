**Calculating LIX Readability Score:**

1. Count the number of words that are longer than six letters: 24
2. Count the number of sentences: 6
3. Calculate LIX score using the formula: LIX = (words / sentences) + (percent of long words / 100)
4. Percent of long words = (long words / total words) * 100 = (24 / 122) * 100 = 19.67%
5. LIX = (122 / 6) + (19.67 / 100) = 20.33 + 0.1967 = **20.53**

**LIX = 20.53**
