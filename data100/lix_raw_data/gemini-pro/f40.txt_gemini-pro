**LIX = 55**

The LIX readability score is calculated using the following formula:

```
LIX = (N of words with more than 6 letters / N of words) * 100 + (N of sentences / N of sentences and words with over 6 letters) * 1
```

**Step 1: Count the number of words with more than 6 letters.**
There are 239 words with more than 6 letters in the text.

**Step 2: Count the number of words.**
There are 351 words in the text.

**Step 3: Count the number of sentences.**
There are 18 sentences in the text.

**Step 4: Count the number of sentences and words with over 6 letters.**
There are 13 sentences and words with over 6 letters.

**Step 5: Plug the numbers into the formula.**
```
LIX = (239 / 351) * 100 + (18 / 13) * 1 = 68.09 + 1.38 = 55
