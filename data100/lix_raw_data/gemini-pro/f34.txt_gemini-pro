**Readability Analysis:**

The LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score is calculated using the following formula:

LIX = (Characters / Words) + (Sentences / Words) * 100

**Character Count:** 467
**Word Count:** 69
**Sentence Count:** 7

**Calculation:**

LIX = (467 / 69) + (7 / 69) * 100
LIX = 6.8 + 10.14 * 100
LIX = 6.8 + 1014
**LIX = 1020.8**

Therefore, the LIX readability score for the given Swedish text is 1020.8.
