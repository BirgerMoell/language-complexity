**Steps to calculate the LIX readability score:**

1. **Count the number of periods (full stops).** There are 4 periods in the text.
2. **Count the number of words with more than 6 letters.** There are 22 words with more than 6 letters in the text.
3. **Calculate the average sentence length:** The average sentence length is (number of words) / (number of periods) = 22 / 4 = 5.5.
4. **Calculate the LIX score:** The LIX score is calculated using the following formula: LIX = (average sentence length) + (percentage of words with more than 6 letters) / 100.
5. **Round the score to the nearest whole number.**

**Results:**

* Average sentence length: 5.5
* Percentage of words with more than 6 letters: 22 / 44 * 100 = 50%
* LIX score: 5.5 + 50 / 100 = 10.5

**LIX=11**
