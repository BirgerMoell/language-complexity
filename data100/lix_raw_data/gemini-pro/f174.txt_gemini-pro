**LIX readibility score calculation:**

1. Count the number of long words (words with 6 or more letters): 25
2. Count the number of sentences: 5
3. Calculate the average sentence length (number of long words divided by the number of sentences): 5

**LIX formula:** LIX = ((average sentence length) + (percentage of long words)) * 100

**Percentage of long words:** (25 / 45) * 100 = 55.56%

**LIX score:** ((5) + (55.56)) * 100 = **60.56**

**Result:** LIX=60.56
