To calculate the LIX readability score, we use the following formula:

```
LIX = (Number of words / Number of sentences) + (Percentage of long words / 100)
```

First, we count the number of words and sentences in the text:

```
Words: 148
Sentences: 4
```

Next, we count the number of words with more than nine letters (long words):

```
Long words: 32
```

Now we can calculate the LIX readability score:

```
LIX = (148 / 4) + (32 / 100) = 37 + 0.32 = 37.32
```

Therefore, the LIX readability score for the Swedish text is:

```
LIX = 37.32
```
