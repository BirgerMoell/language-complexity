**LIX calculation:**

1. Count the number of sentences (1) in the text: 5
2. Count the number of words (2) in the text: 76
3. Count the number of long words (3) in the text: 20 (words with more than 6 letters)
4. Calculate the average number of words per sentence (4) by dividing (2) by (1): 76 / 5 = 15.2
5. Calculate the percentage of long words (5) by dividing (3) by (2) and multiplying by 100: 20 / 76 * 100 = 26.32%

**LIX score:**

(6) LIX = (4) + (5) * 1 / (4)
LIX = 15.2 + 26.32% * 1 / 15.2
**LIX = 18.66**
