**Word count** = 48
**Sentence count** = 4
**Average sentence length** = 48 / 4 = 12

**Formula for LIX:**

LIX = (average sentence length) + (percentage of long words)

**Percentage of long words:**
Look at every word in the text. If a word has more than 6 letters, it is considered a long word.
Long words: 13
Total words: 48
Percentage of long words: (13 / 48) * 100 = 27.08%

**LIX calculation:**

LIX = 12 + 27.08
LIX = 39.08

**Result:**

LIX = 39.08
