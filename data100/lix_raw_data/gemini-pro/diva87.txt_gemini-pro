**Step 1: Count the number of words in the text.**

There are 76 words in the text.

**Step 2: Count the number of long words in the text.**

A long word is defined as any word with more than 6 letters. There are 38 long words in the text.

**Step 3: Calculate the LIX readability score.**

The LIX readability score is calculated using the following formula:

```
LIX = (Number of long words / Number of words) * 100 + (Number of sentences / Number of words) * 1
```

In this case, the LIX readability score is:

```
LIX = (38 / 76) * 100 + (1 / 76) * 1 = 50.13
```

Therefore, the result is: **LIX=50.13**
