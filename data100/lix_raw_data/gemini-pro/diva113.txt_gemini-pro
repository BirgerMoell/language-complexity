**Step 1: Divide the text into sentences.**

There are 6 sentences in the text.

**Step 2: Count the number of words in the text.**

There are 67 words in the text.

**Step 3: Count the number of long words in the text.**

A long word is a word with more than 6 letters. There are 27 long words in the text.

**Step 4: Calculate the LIX readibility score.**

The LIX readibility score is calculated using the following formula:

```
LIX = (Words / Sentences) + (Long words / Sentences) - 2
```

Plugging in the values we calculated in the previous steps, we get:

```
LIX = (67 / 6) + (27 / 6) - 2
LIX = 11.17 + 4.5 - 2
LIX = 13.67
```

**Result:**

LIX = 13.67
