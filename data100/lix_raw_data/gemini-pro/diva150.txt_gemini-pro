**LIX Calculator**

1. Count the number of words in the text: 82
2. Count the number of long words (more than 6 letters): 50
3. Calculate the LIX score using the formula: LIX = (words / sentences) + (%long_words * 100 / words)
4. Count the number of sentences in the text: 7

**LIX Score Calculation**

LIX = ((82 / 7) + (50 * 100 / 82))
LIX = (11.71 + 61)
**LIX = 72.71**
