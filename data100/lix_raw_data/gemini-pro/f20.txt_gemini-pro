The LIX readability score is calculated as follows:

1. Count the number of long words (words with more than 6 letters) in the text.
2. Count the number of sentences in the text.
3. Count the number of words in the text.
4. Calculate the average number of long words per sentence: long words / sentences.
5. Calculate the average number of words per sentence: words / sentences.
6. Calculate the LIX score: average words per sentence + (average long words per sentence * 100).

In the provided text:

- Number of long words: 10
- Number of sentences: 5
- Number of words: 60

Average number of long words per sentence: 10 / 5 = 2
Average number of words per sentence: 60 / 5 = 12

LIX score: 12 + (2 * 100) = **32**

Therefore, the LIX readability score of the provided text is **LIX=32**.
