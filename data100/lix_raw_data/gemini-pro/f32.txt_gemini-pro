**Analysis:**

The text contains 93 words, 104 sentences, and 565 characters (excluding spaces).

**LIX score calculation:**

```
LIX = (Average number of words per sentence + Number of long words / 100 words) * 0.85
```

- Average number of words per sentence: 93 words / 104 sentences = 0.894
- Number of long words (with more than 6 letters): 207 / 100 = 2.11
- LIX score: (0.894 + 2.11) * 0.85 = **30.13**

**Result:**

LIX = 30.13
