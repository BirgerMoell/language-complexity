**LIX readability score calculation:**

The LIX readability score is calculated using the following formula:

```
LIX = (NWS + NSL) / NWORDS
```

where:

* **NWS** is the number of words per sentence
* **NSL** is the number of long words (words with more than 6 letters)
* **NWORDS** is the total number of words

**Analysis of the text:**

* Number of sentences: 5
* Number of words: 83
* Number of long words: 40

**Calculation:**

```
NWS = 83 / 5 = 16.6
NSL = 40
NWORDS = 83

LIX = (16.6 + 40) / 83 = 0.68
```

**Result:**

LIX = 0.68
