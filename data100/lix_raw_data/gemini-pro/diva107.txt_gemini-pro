**Steps to compute the LIX score:**

1. Count the number of words (excluding particles like "och", "att", etc.) = 126
2. Count the number of periods = 1
3. Count the number of words with more than 6 letters (excluding proper nouns) = 61

**Formula:**

```
LIX = (Antalet l√•nga ord / Antal ord) * 100 + (Antal meningar / Antal ord) * 100 = (61 / 126) * 100 + (1 / 126) * 100
```

**Result:**

```
LIX = (61 / 126) * 100 + (1 / 126) * 100 = 50.4762
```

**Conclusion:**

The LIX readability score for the given Swedish text is **LIX=50.48**. This indicates that the text is relatively easy to read and understand, with a reading level suitable for individuals with secondary school education.
