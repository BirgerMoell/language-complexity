**Text analysis:**

The text consists of 86 words and 564 characters (including spaces and punctuation).

**LIX calculation:**

The LIX readability score is calculated as follows:

```
LIX = (words / sentences) + (long words / words) * 100
```

where:

* words = number of words in the text
* sentences = number of sentences in the text
* long words = number of words with more than 6 characters

**Calculating the LIX score:**

1. Count the number of words: 86
2. Count the number of sentences: 4
3. Count the number of long words: 45
4. Calculate the LIX score:

```
LIX = (86 / 4) + (45 / 86) * 100
LIX = 21.5 + 52.33
LIX = 73.83
```

**Result:**

LIX=73.83
