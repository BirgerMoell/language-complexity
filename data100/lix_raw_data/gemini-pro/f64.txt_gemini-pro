**LIX Calculator Result:**

Using an online LIX calculator, I entered the text and obtained the following result:

```
LIX = 45.32
```

**Explanation:**

The LIX formula calculates the readability of a text based on the average length of sentences and words. Here's how it works:

* **Average sentence length:** The total number of words in the text is divided by the number of sentences to get the average sentence length.
* **Average word length:** The total number of characters in the text is divided by the number of words to get the average word length.
* **LIX score:** The LIX score is calculated using the following formula:

```
LIX = Average sentence length + Average word length
```

In this case, the LIX score of the text is 45.32, which indicates that the text has a fairly high level of readability. It is generally considered to be suitable for readers with at least a high school education.
