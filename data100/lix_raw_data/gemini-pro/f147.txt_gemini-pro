**LIX calculation:**

1. **Count the total number of words:** There are 104 words in the text.
2. **Count the number of long words (more than 6 characters):** There are 40 long words.
3. **Calculate the percentage of long words:** 40/104 * 100 = 38.46%
4. **Calculate the average sentence length:** There are 11 sentences in the text, and a total of 104 words. So the average sentence length is 104/11 = 9.45 words.
5. **Calculate the LIX score:** LIX = (Percentage of long words) + (Average sentence length) = 38.46% + 9.45 = **47.91**

Therefore, the LIX readability score of the Swedish text is **LIX=47.91**.
