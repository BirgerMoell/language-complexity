The LIX readibility score is calculated as follows:

1. Count the number of words in the text.
2. Count the number of long words in the text. A long word is defined as a word with more than 6 letters.
3. Divide the number of long words by the number of words in the text.
4. Multiply the result by 100.

In this case, the text has 71 words, and 33 of these are long words. Therefore, the LIX readibility score is:

(33 / 71) * 100 = 46.48

LIX=46.48
