According to the LIX Calculator by ReadabilityFormulas.com, the LIX readibility score for the given Swedish text is:

**LIX=18**

**Explanation:** The LIX readibility score is calculated using the following formula:

```
LIX = 100 * (Words / Sentences) + 100 * (LongWords / Words)
```

where:

* **Words** is the number of words in the text
* **Sentences** is the number of sentences in the text
* **LongWords** is the number of words with more than 6 letters

**Calculation:**

* **Words:** 65
* **Sentences:** 4
* **LongWords:** 27

```
LIX = 100 * (65 / 4) + 100 * (27 / 65) = 18
