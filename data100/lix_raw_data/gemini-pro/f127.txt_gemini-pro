**LIX calculation:**

* Count the number of words in the text: 81
* Count the number of long words (words with 6 or more letters): 38
* Count the number of sentences in the text: 12
* Calculate LIX using the formula: LIX = (words / sentences) + (long words / words) * 100
* LIX = (81 / 12) + (38 / 81) * 100
* LIX = 6.75 + 46.91
* **LIX = 53.66**

Therefore, the LIX readability score for the given text is 53.66. This indicates that the text is relatively difficult to read and is suitable for readers with a high school education or higher.
