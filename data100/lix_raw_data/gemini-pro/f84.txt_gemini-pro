**LIX Analysis:**

The LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex, Swedish for Readability Index) is a measure of the readability of a text in Swedish.

**Formula:**

```
LIX = (NP / Words) + (NS / Words) * 100
```

where:
* NP = Number of periods (full stops)
* NS = Number of sentences
* Words = Number of words

**Calculation:**

1. **NP:** The text contains 2 periods.
2. **NS:** The text contains 4 sentences.
3. **Words:** The text contains 131 words.

**LIX Score:**

```
LIX = (2 / 131) + (4 / 131) * 100 = 0.015 + 0.030 * 100 = 3.15
```

**Result:**

```
LIX = 3.15
