**Analysis:**

The text contains 70 words, 425 letters (excluding spaces) and 138 sentences. The average word length is 425/70 = 6.07 letters. 

**LIX calculation:**

LIX = (average word length + number of sentences / 100 words) * 0.79

LIX = (6.07 + 138/100) * 0.79
LIX = (6.07 + 1.38) * 0.79
LIX = 7.45 * 0.79
LIX = 5.88

**Result:**

LIX=5.88
