**LIX score calculation:**

1. **Count the number of words in the text:** There are 194 words in the text.
2. **Count the number of long words (words with more than 6 letters):** There are 109 long words in the text.
3. **Calculate the average sentence length:** The average sentence length is 194 words / 13 sentences = 15 words.
4. **Calculate the LIX score using the formula:** LIX = (average sentence length + percentage of long words) / 100
5. **Plug in the values:** LIX = ((15 + (109 / 194) * 100) / 100)

**Result:**

LIX = 20.2
