**Analysis:**

* **Number of words:** 51
* **Number of sentences:** 3
* **Number of long words (â‰¥7 letters):** 13
* **Average sentence length:** 17 words

**LIX calculation:**

```
LIX = (48 * (Number of long words / Number of words) + 100 * (Number of sentences / Number of words)) / 100
```

```
LIX = (48 * (13/51) + 100 * (3/51)) / 100
```

```
LIX = (48 * 0.2549 + 100 * 0.0588) / 100
```

```
LIX = (12.24 + 5.88) / 100
```

```
LIX = 18.12 / 100
```

**LIX result:**

```
LIX = 18.12
