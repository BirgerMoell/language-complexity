**Analysis:**

* Number of words: 37
* Number of long words (more than 6 letters): 10
* Number of sentences: 1

**LIX calculation:**

LIX = (Number of long words / Number of words) * (Number of sentences / Number of words) * 100

LIX = (10 / 37) * (1 / 37) * 100
LIX = 0.0676 * 0.027 * 100
LIX = 0.1833

**Result:**

LIX = 0.18
