**LIX readability score calculation:**

1. Count the number of letters in the text: 479
2. Count the number of words in the text: 118
3. Count the number of sentences in the text: 5
4. Calculate the average number of letters per word: 479 / 118 = 4.06
5. Calculate the average number of sentences per 100 words: 5 / (118 / 100) = 4.24
6. Calculate the LIX score using the formula: LIX = (average number of letters per word + average number of sentences per 100 words) / 2
7. LIX = (4.06 + 4.24) / 2 = 4.15

**Result:**

LIX=4.15
