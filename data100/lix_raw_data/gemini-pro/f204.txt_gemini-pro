**LIX formula:**

LIX = (Number of words with more than 6 letters / Number of words) * 100 + (Number of sentences / Number of words) * 100

**Number of words:** 38
**Number of words with more than 6 letters:** 24
**Number of sentences:** 3

**LIX calculation:**

(24 / 38) * 100 + (3 / 38) * 100 = 63.16 + 7.89 = 71.05

**Result:**

LIX=71.05
