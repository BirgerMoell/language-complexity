To calculate the LIX readability score, we need to count the following: 

- Number of words: 87
- Number of long words (more than 6 letters): 54
- Number of sentences: 6

LIX = (Number of words / Number of sentences) + (Percentage of long words * 100)

LIX = (87 / 6) + (54 / 87 * 100) = 14,5 + 62,1 = **20,6**
