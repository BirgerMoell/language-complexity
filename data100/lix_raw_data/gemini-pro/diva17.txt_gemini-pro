**LIX Score**

LIX = 44.86

**Explanation**

The LIX readability score is calculated using the following formula:

```
LIX = (Average sentence length + Word count / 100) * 100
```

In this case, we have:

```
Average sentence length = 18.45
Word count = 62
```

Plugging these values into the formula, we get:

```
LIX = ((18.45 + 62 / 100) * 100
LIX = 44.86
```

Therefore, the LIX readability score for the given Swedish text is 44.86.
