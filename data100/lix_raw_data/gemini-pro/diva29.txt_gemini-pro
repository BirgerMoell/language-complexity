**Word count:** 92
**Long sentences (more than 20 words):** 2

**LIX Score Calculation:**

LIX = 100 * (Nwords / Nsentences) + C * (Lword / Nwords)

Where:
* Nwords is the number of words in the text
* Nsentences is the number of sentences in the text
* Lword is the average number of letters per word
* C is a constant (34)

**Calculating Lword:**

Lword = Total number of letters in the text / Number of words
Lword = 693 / 92 = 7.5326

**Plugging in the values:**

LIX = 100 * (92 / 6) + 34 * (7.5326 / 92)
LIX = 100 * 15.3333 + 34 * 0.0819
LIX = 1533.33 + 2.7896
LIX = 1536.12

**Result:**

LIX = 1536.12
