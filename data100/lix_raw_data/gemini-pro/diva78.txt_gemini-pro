**Analysis:**

The provided text consists of 114 words and 839 characters (excluding spaces).

**LIX Readability Score Calculation:**

The LIX readability score is calculated as follows:

```
LIX = (Average word length + Percentage of long words) / 100
```

Average word length: 114 words / 839 characters = 7.35 characters per word
Percentage of long words (more than 6 characters): 61 words / 114 words * 100 = 53.51%

```
LIX = (7.35 + 53.51) / 100 = 55.41 / 100 = 0.5541
```

**Result:**

LIX = 0.5541
