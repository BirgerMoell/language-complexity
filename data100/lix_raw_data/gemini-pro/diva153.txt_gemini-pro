**Calculating the LIX Readability Score**

1. Count the number of words in the text: 65
2. Count the number of long words (with more than 6 letters): 25
3. Count the number of sentences in the text: 10

**Formula:**

```
LIX = (Number of long words / Number of words) * 100 + (Number of sentences / Number of words) * 10
```

**Calculation:**

```
LIX = (25 / 65) * 100 + (10 / 65) * 10 = 42.46
```

**Result:**

LIX = 42.46
