1. **Count the number of words** (excluding very common "function words" like "och", "att", "s√•", etc.): 47
2. **Count the number of long words** (6 letters or more): 33
3. **Calculate the average number of long words per sentence:** 33 / 6 = 5.5
4. **Calculate the LIX readability score:** (average number of long words per sentence) + (percentage of long words) * (100 - average number of long words per sentence) = 5.5 + (33 / 47) * (100 - 5.5) = 5.5 + 0.7 * 94.5 = **21.5**

Therefore, the LIX readibility score for the given text is **LIX=21.5**.
