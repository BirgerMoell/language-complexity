**LIX Calculation:**

The LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score is calculated using the following formula:

```
LIX = (Words / Sentences) + (100 * LongWords / Words)
```

**Step 1: Count Words and Sentences**

* Words: 65
* Sentences: 5

**Step 2: Count LongWords (Words longer than 6 letters)**

* LongWords: 23

**Step 3: Plug Values into Formula**

```
LIX = (65 / 5) + (100 * 23 / 65)
LIX = 13 + 35.38
LIX = 48.38
```

**Result:**

LIX = 48.38
