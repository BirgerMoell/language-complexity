**Analysis**

The text consists of 24 words:

- Number of letters: 161
- Number of sentences: 1
- Number of words with more than 6 letters: 10

**LIX calculation**

The LIX formula is:

```
LIX = (number of words with more than 6 letters / number of words) * 100 + (number of sentences / number of words) * 100
```

Plugging in the numbers, we get:

```
LIX = (10 / 24) * 100 + (1 / 24) * 100 = 45.83
```

**Result**

LIX = 45.83
