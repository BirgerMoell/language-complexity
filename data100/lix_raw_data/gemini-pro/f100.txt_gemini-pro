**LIX readability score calculation:**

1. Count the number of words in the text: 448
2. Count the number of long words (words with more than 6 letters): 225
3. Count the number of sentences (full stops): 35

**LIX formula:**

```
LIX = (words / sentences) + ((long words / words) * 100)
```

**Calculation:**

```
LIX = (448 / 35) + ((225 / 448) * 100)
LIX = 12.77 + 50.22
LIX â‰ˆ 63
```

**Result:**

LIX = 63
