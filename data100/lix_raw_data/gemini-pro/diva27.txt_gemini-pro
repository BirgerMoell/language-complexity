1. Count the number of letters in the text. (excluding spaces and punctuation)
> 186 letters

2. Count the number of words in the text.
> 31 words

3. Count the number of sentences in the text.
> 3 sentences

4. Calculate the average number of letters per word:
> 186 letters / 31 words = 6.00 letters per word

5. Calculate the average number of words per sentence:
> 31 words / 3 sentences = 10.33 words per sentence

6. Plug these values into the LIX formula:
> LIX = (39 * average number of letters per word) / (average number of words per sentence)
> LIX = (39 * 6.00) / (10.33)
> LIX = 23.46

**Result: LIX=23.46**
