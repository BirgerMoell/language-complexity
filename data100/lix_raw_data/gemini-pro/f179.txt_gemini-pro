**Syllable count:** 234

**Word count:** 68

**Average sentence length:** 12.26 words

**LIX readability score:**

LIX = 40.46

**Calculation:**

1. Calculate the average sentence length:
Number of words / Number of sentences = 68 words / 5 sentences = 12.26 words

2. Calculate the percentage of long words (words with more than 6 letters):
Number of long words / Total number of words = 114 long words / 234 total words = 0.49

3. Plug the values into the LIX formula:
LIX = Average sentence length + Percentage of long words * 100 = 12.26 + 0.49 * 100 = 40.46

**Result:**

LIX = 40.46
