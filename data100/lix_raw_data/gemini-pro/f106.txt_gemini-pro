**Analysis:**

The text has 88 words, 547 characters (excluding spaces), and 11 sentences.

**LIX calculation:**

The LIX formula is:

```
LIX = (words/sentences) + ((characters excluding spaces)/words) * 100
```

Plugging in the values from the text:

```
LIX = (88/11) + ((547/88) * 100) = 8 + 62.16 = 70.16
```

**Result:**

LIX = 70.16
