**LIX calculation:**

The LIX formula is: LIX = (Number of words / Number of sentences) + (Number of long words / Number of words) * 100

* **Number of words:** 51
* **Number of sentences:** 4
* **Number of long words (more than 6 letters):** 22

**Calculation:**

((51 / 4) + ((22 / 51) * 100)) = 33.25

**LIX = 33.25**
