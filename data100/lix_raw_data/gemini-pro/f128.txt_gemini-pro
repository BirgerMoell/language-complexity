The LIX readability score is a measure of the complexity of a text. It is calculated by taking the average number of words per sentence and the average number of characters per word.

To calculate the LIX score of the Swedish text, we first need to count the number of words and sentences in the text. There are 61 words and 7 sentences in the text.

Next, we need to calculate the average number of words per sentence. This is done by dividing the number of words by the number of sentences. In this case, the average number of words per sentence is 61/7 = 8.71.

Next, we need to calculate the average number of characters per word. This is done by dividing the number of characters in the text by the number of words. In this case, there are 445 characters in the text, so the average number of characters per word is 445/61 = 7.3.

Finally, we can calculate the LIX score by adding the average number of words per sentence and the average number of characters per word. In this case, the LIX score is 8.71 + 7.3 = 16.01.

Therefore, the LIX readability score of the Swedish text is **LIX=16.01**.
