**LIX Calculation:**

1. Count the number of periods (full stops): 5
2. Count the number of long words (words with more than 6 letters): 13
3. Calculate the LIX score using the formula: LIX = (Average number of long words per sentence) * (100 / Average number of periods per sentence)

LIX = (13 / 5) * (100 / 5) = 52

**Result:**
LIX = 52
