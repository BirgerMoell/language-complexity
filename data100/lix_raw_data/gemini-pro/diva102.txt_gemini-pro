**Analyzing the text:**

* **Number of words:** 39
* **Number of long words (more than 6 letters):** 12
* **Number of sentences:** 4

**Calculating the LIX readability score:**

```
LIX = ((Number of long words / Number of words) * 100) + (Average sentence length)
```

```
LIX = ((12 / 39) * 100) + (39 / 4)
= (30.77) + 9.75
= 40.52
```

**Result:**

LIX=40.52
