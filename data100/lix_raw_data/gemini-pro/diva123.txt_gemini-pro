**Step 1: Count the number of words, sentences, and long words.**

* Number of words: 42
* Number of sentences: 4
* Number of long words (with more than 6 letters): 18

**Step 2: Calculate the average sentence length.**

* Average sentence length = Number of words / Number of sentences
* Average sentence length = 42 / 4 = 10.5

**Step 3: Calculate the LIX score.**

* LIX = Average sentence length + Percentage of long words
* LIX = 10.5 + (18 / 42) * 100
* LIX = 10.5 + 42.86
* **LIX = 43.36**
