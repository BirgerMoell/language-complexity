**LIX calculator**

**Instructions:**

1. Count the number of long words (words with more than 5 letters) in the text.
2. Count the number of sentences in the text.
3. Divide the number of long words by the number of sentences.
4. Multiply the result by 10.
5. Add the number of sentences to the result.
6. The resulting number is the LIX readability score.

**Calculations:**

Number of long words: 116
Number of sentences: 5
116 / 5 = 23.2
23.2 x 10 = 232
232 + 5 = 237

**LIX = 237**
