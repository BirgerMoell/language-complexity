To calculate the LIX readability score, we need to use the following formula:

LIX = (W / S) x (S / F)

Where:
W = Total number of words
S = Total number of sentences
F = Total number of words with more than 6 characters in each sentence

Now let's analyze the given text:

1. Remove any non-essential parts and brackets from the text: 
"The essay describes the need for solutions in offices in form of accessories that support an activity-based approach. Suggested accessories that solve problems studied are presented."

Total words (W) = 24
2. Count the number of sentences (S): 2
3. Count the number of words with more than 6 characters in each sentence (F) and sum them up:

Sentence 1:
- The
- essay
- describes
- need
- solutions
- offices
- form
- accessories
- support
- activity
- approach
Total words with more than 6 characters in Sentence 1 = 6

Sentence 2:
- Suggested
- accessories
- solve
- problems
- studied
- presented
Total words with more than 6 characters in Sentence 2 = 5

Total F = 6 + 5 = 11

Now apply the values in the formula to get the LIX readability score:
LIX = (24 / 2) x (2 / 11) 
= 12 x 0.18 
= 2.16

LIX = 2.16
