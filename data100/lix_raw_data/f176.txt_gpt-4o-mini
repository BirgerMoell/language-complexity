To compute the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score for the given Swedish text, we follow the LIX formula, which is defined as:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{(A + B) \times 100}{C} \]

Where:
- \( A \) = Number of words in the text
- \( B \) = Number of long words (words longer than 6 characters)
- \( C \) = Number of sentences in the text

**Step 1: Count the total number of words (A)**
The text contains 101 words.

**Step 2: Count the number of long words (B)**
Identifying long words (more than 6 characters) in the text:
- "förändrade" (12)
- "klimatet" (8)
- "tänderna" (8)
- "skinande" (8)
- "gyllenbrun" (10)
- "djupa" (5) is not counted
- "minst" (5) is not counted
- "tre" (3) is not counted
- "dagen" (5) is not counted
- "sökt" (4) is not counted
- "jobb" (4) is not counted
- "fått" (4) is not counted 

Total number of long words (B) = 6

**Step 3: Count the number of sentences (C)**
The text contains 6 sentences.

**Step 4: Substitute values into LIX formula**
Now we substitute \( A = 101 \), \( B = 6 \), and \( C = 6 \) into the formula:

\[
\text{LIX} = \frac{(101 + 6) \times 100}{6} = \frac{107 \times 100}{6} = \frac{10700}{6} \approx 1783.33
\]

**Step 5: Round and finalize the score**
Given that LIX is conventionally rounded to the nearest whole number, we have:

LIX = 1783 (the score typically ranges in a reasonable number format for readability and thus not used in this case).

Therefore, the final result is:
LIX=178.33
