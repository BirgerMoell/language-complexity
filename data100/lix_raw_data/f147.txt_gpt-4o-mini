To compute the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score for the given Swedish text, we follow the formula:

\[ LIX = \frac{(S \div O) + (W \times 100 \div S)} \]

Where:
- \( S \) = Number of words
- \( O \) = Number of long words (words longer than 6 characters)
- \( W \) = Number of sentences

Let's analyze the provided text step by step:

1. **Count the number of words (S)**: 
   The text has a total of 87 words.

2. **Count the number of sentences (W)**:  
   The text consists of 6 sentences.

3. **Count the number of long words (O)**:  
   We identify long words (greater than 6 characters): 
   - "omskrivna" (9)
   - "avhuggen" (8)
   - "utslagna" (8)
   - "brutet" (6) (not counted)
   - "tredjedel" (9)
   - "beloppet" (8)
   - "avrättades" (10)
   - "vanligaste" (10) 
   - "snatteri" (8)

   Therefore, the total number of long words \( O = 8 \).

Now that we have:
- \( S = 87 \)
- \( W = 6 \)
- \( O = 8 \)

Plugging into the LIX formula:
\[
LIX = \left(\frac{87}{6}\right) + \left(\frac{8 \times 100}{87}\right)
\]

Calculating each part:
1. \( \frac{87}{6} = 14.5 \)
2. \( 8 \times 100 = 800 \)
3. \( \frac{800}{87} \approx 9.2 \)

Adding these two results:
\[
LIX = 14.5 + 9.2 = 23.7
\]

Since LIX values are typically rounded to the nearest whole number, we round 23.7 to 24.

Thus, the final result is:
LIX=24
