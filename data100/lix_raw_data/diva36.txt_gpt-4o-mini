To calculate the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow the formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{(N/W) + (S \times 100)}{100} \]

Where:
- \( N \) = total number of words
- \( W \) = total number of sentences
- \( S \) = number of long words (words with more than 6 letters)

Now, let's analyze the text:

1. **Count the Words (N)**: The text contains **81 words**.
2. **Count the Sentences (W)**: The text contains **3 sentences**.
3. **Count the Long Words (S)**: 
   - The long words (more than 6 letters) in the text: 
     - "beräkningsmetoder" (17)
     - "ickelevererad" (13)
     - "utvecklas" (9)
     - "studeras" (8)
     - "jämförelse" (10)
     - "metod" (not included since it has 5 letters)
     - "regleringsverktyget" (20)
     - "avbrottsstatistiken" (18)
     - "samband" (not included since it has 7 letters)
     - "typkundskategorier" (17)
     - "avbrott" (not included since it has 7 letters)
     - "härleda" (not included since it has 7 letters)
     - "varierande" (not included since it has 9 letters)
     - "tätheten" (not included since it has 8 letters)
     - "redundansen" (not included since it has 10 letters)
     - "prioriteten" (not included since it has 12 letters)
     - "aspekt" (not included since it has 6 letters)
     - Total long words = **10**

Now substituting these counts into the LIX formula:

- \( N = 81 \)
- \( W = 3 \)
- \( S = 10 \)

Plugging the values into the formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{(81/3) + (10 \times 100)}{100} \]
\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{27 + 1000}{100} \]
\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{1027}{100} \]
\[ \text{LIX} = 10.27 \]

Finally, we round the result for presentation:

LIX=10.27
