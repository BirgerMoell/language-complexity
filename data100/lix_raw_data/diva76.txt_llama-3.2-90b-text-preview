To calculate the LIX (Läsvärdighetsindex) readability score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average number of words per sentence (LIX-ordinal).
   Divide the total number of words by the total number of sentences.

Total words in the text: 44
Total sentences: 4

LIX-ordinal = 44 / 4 = 11

2. Calculate the percentage of long words in the text.
   A 'long word' is a word with more than 6 characters.

In the text, we can count the following words as 'long words': 
- handledare
- handledning
- institutionen
- byggvetenskap 
- handledare
- bihandledare
- diskussioner
- deltagande
- studiebesök
- karin
No, 'Karin' is a proper noun and should not be counted.
There are also two other proper nouns in the list and 'handledare' which appears twice and you have 'byggvetenskap' also twice one being first time and one attached to 'KTH'.
There are 9 unique long words.

Percent long words = (9 / 44) * 100 ≈ 20.45%

3. Calculate the LIX score using the following formula:
   LIX = LIX-ordinal + (Percent long words * 0.4) - 2.79

Using a calculator to perform the calculation:
LIX ≈ 11 + (20.45 * 0.4) - 2.79 ≈ 11 + 8.18 - 2.79 ≈ 16.39

Rounding down to two decimal places:
LIX ≈ 16.39

So, 
LIX = 16.39
