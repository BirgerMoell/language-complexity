To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: Words are defined as sequences of characters separated by spaces. In the given text, there are 96 words.

2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as words with more than 6 characters. In the text, the long words are: "Examensarbetet", "samarbete", "deltagarna", "utvecklat", "demonstrationsplattform", "testa", "idéer", "projektet", "består", "dynamiskt", "nätverk", "utbyter", "information", "tjänster", "syftet", "examensarbetet", "utforma", "implementera". This gives us a total of 17 long words.

3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: Sentences are defined as sequences ending in a period, exclamation point, or question mark. In the provided text, there are 4 sentences.

4. **Apply the LIX formula**:
   \[
   LIX = \frac{W}{S} + \frac{L \times 100}{W}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   - W = 96
   - L = 17
   - S = 4

   \[
   LIX = \frac{96}{4} + \frac{17 \times 100}{96}
   \]

   Calculating each part:
   \[
   \frac{96}{4} = 24
   \]
   \[
   \frac{17 \times 100}{96} \approx 17.708
   \]
   So,
   \[
   LIX \approx 24 + 17.708 \approx 41.708
   \]

Finally, rounding to a reasonable decimal:
LIX=42. 

Thus, the LIX readability score for the text is:

**LIX=42**
