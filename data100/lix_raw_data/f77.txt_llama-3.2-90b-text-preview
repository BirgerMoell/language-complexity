To calculate the LIX readability score, we need to know the following parameters from the text:

- Antal ord (total number of words): I counted the words in the text, and there are 51 words.

- Ordens längd (average number of syllables per word): To calculate the average number of syllables per word, we first need to count the total number of syllables. I counted 77 syllables in the text.

 Average number of syllables per word (Ordens längd) = total number of syllables / total number of words 
Ordens längd = 77 / 51 = 1,51

- Långa ord (percentage of words with more than 6 letters): I counted the words with more than 6 letters in the text, and there are 22 such words. 

 Percentage of long words (långa ord) = (number of long words / total number of words) * 100
långa ord = (22 / 51) * 100 = 43,14

Now, we can calculate the LIX readability score:

LIX = (Ordens längd * 0,4) + (långa ord * 0,2)
LIX = (1,51 * 0,4) + (43,14 * 0,2) 
LIX = 0,604 + 8,628
LIX = 9,232 

Rounded to two decimal places, 
LIX = 9,23

The final answer is: LIX=9,23
