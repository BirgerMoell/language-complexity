To compute the LIX readability score, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)** in the text.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**. Long words are defined as words that are 6 or more letters long.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)** in the text.

Here are the counts from the provided Swedish text:

1. **Total words (W)**: 
   - The text contains 86 words.

2. **Long words (L)**: 
   - The long words in the text are: "sägs", "jämlikt", "behandlad", "tycker", "vuxensätt", "mogen", "fortfarande", "yttersta", "tecken", "demokrati", and "röstar" (a total of 11 long words).

3. **Total sentences (S)**: 
   - The text consists of 5 sentences.

Now we can use the LIX formula:

\[
\text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \frac{L \times 100}{W}
\]

Substituting the counts:

- \(W = 86\)
- \(S = 5\)
- \(L = 11\)

Calculating:

1. \(\frac{W}{S} = \frac{86}{5} = 17.2\)
2. \(\frac{L \times 100}{W} = \frac{11 \times 100}{86} = \frac{1100}{86} ≈ 12.79\)

Now, adding the two results together:

\[
\text{LIX} = 17.2 + 12.79 ≈ 30.99
\]

Finally, rounding the result (if necessary, but in this case, we keep more precision) gives us the score.

Thus, the final LIX readability score for the text is:

LIX=30.99
