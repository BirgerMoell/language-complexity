To calculate the LIX readability score, I will follow these steps:

1. Count the number of words: I count 56 words in the text.

2. Count the number of long words (words with more than 6 characters): 
I count 24 long words in the text. 

3. Count the average number of words per sentence (I will calculate this later).

4. First, count the number of sentences: I count 3 sentences in the text.

   Now I can calculate the average number of words per sentence:
   56 words / 3 sentences = approximately 18.67 words per sentence.

   Since we want a whole number, we round down to 18 words per sentence.

The LIX formula is:
   ( Words with more than 6 letters per 100 words ) * ( Average number of words per sentence * 0.4 )

   I replace the values I've computed:
   ( 24 * 100 / 56 ) * ( 18 * 0.4 )
   approximately 42.86 * 7.2 
   approximately 42.86 + ( 42.86 * 0.2 ) - as LIX =  ( words with more than six characters per 100 words * average sentence length / 100  * 0.2). To obtain this, first convert percentage to raw long words per 100 words as a multiplier with average words per sentence   7.2 
   approximately  42.86 * .2  + 43 * .4 * 7.2 * .6    simplifying the original,   = ( 8.57 + 43 * 1.728 )   Final = ( 8.57 + 74.3 ) )  
   
  = ( 82.88  >68 and about a 60 year old with time)

  approximately 82.88  Noting that there was rounding  LIX value is based on original description between  (60s  80)
 so Final value less about ( than another number)
