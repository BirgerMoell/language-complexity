To calculate the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score for the given Swedish text, we use the LIX formula:

LIX = (number of words / number of sentences) + (number of long words * 100 / number of words)

Where:
- A "long word" is defined as a word containing more than 6 characters.
- Count the total number of words, sentences, and long words.

Now, let's analyze the given text:

### Text Breakdown
1. **Words**: 
   - Total words: 119
2. **Sentences**:
   - Total sentences: 6
3. **Long Words**:
   - Counting words with more than 6 characters: "intresserar" (12), "viktigt" (7), "framtiden" (9), "förebygga" (10), "kränkningar" (11), "mänskliga" (8), "rättigheterna" (13), "medlem" (6), "återfå" (7), and "värde" (6). Total long words: 8.

### Calculating LIX
Plugging the values into the LIX formula:

- Number of words = 119
- Number of sentences = 6
- Number of long words = 8

LIX = (119 / 6) + (8 * 100 / 119)
LIX = 19.8333 + 6.72
LIX ≈ 26.5533

### Result
Rounding to two decimal places gives LIX = 26.55.

Thus, the final result is:
LIX=26.55
