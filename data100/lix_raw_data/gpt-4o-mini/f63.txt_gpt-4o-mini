To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: 
   The text contains a total of 58 words.

2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: 
   Long words are defined as words that are 6 characters or longer. In the provided text, the long words are:
   - kolonialtiden (12)
   - antikens (8)
   - liknade (7)
   - rasismen (8)
   - berodde (7)
   - ekonomiska (11)
   - juridiska (8)
   - pga. (3, not considered long)

   Total long words (L) = 7.

3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: 
   The text consists of 4 sentences.

Now, we can apply the LIX formula: 

\[ LIX = \frac{W}{S} + \left( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \right) \]

Substituting in our values:

- W (Number of words) = 58
- S (Number of sentences) = 4
- L (Number of long words) = 7

Calculating the score:

1. Calculate \( \frac{W}{S} \):
   \[ \frac{58}{4} = 14.5 \]

2. Calculate \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \):
   \[ \frac{7 \times 100}{58} \approx 12.07 \]

3. Combine these results to get the LIX score:
   \[ LIX = 14.5 + 12.07 \approx 26.57 \]

Thus, the computed LIX readability score for the text is:

LIX=26.57
