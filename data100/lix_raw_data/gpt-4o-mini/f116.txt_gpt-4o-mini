To calculate the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we use the following formula:

LIX = (A / O) + (L × 100 / A)

Where:
- A = Total number of words
- O = Total number of long words (words with more than 6 characters)
- L = Total number of sentences

Now, let's analyze the provided text step by step.

1. **Count the words (A)**: 
   The entire text contains the following words, including headings, sentences, and bullet points. There are 103 words in total.

2. **Count the long words (O)**: 
   Long words are defined as those having more than 6 characters. 
   In the text, the long words identified are:
   - Olika (6) [Not counted]
   - Virustyper (10)
   - oändligt (8)
   - programmeraren (13)
   - gränserna (9)
   - tidigare (8) [If it appeared]
   - ”kommer” (6) [Not counted]
   - speciellt (9)
   - vanligaste (9)
   - huvudtyper (10)
   - indelas (7)
   - infekterar (10)
   - körbara (7)
   - aktiveras (9)
   - användaren (9)
   That gives us 14 long words.

3. **Count the number of sentences (L)**:
   Sentences can be found by looking for periods, question marks, and exclamations.
   In the provided text, there are 6 sentences.

Now substituting these values into the LIX formula:

- A = 103
- O = 14
- L = 6

Plugging the numbers into the formula:

LIX = (A / O) + (L × 100 / A)  
= (103 / 14) + (6 × 100 / 103)  
= 7.357 + 5.825  
= 13.182

Finally, we round the score to the nearest whole number.

The LIX readability score for the given text is:

LIX=13
