To calculate the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of words (W)**: A word is defined as any sequence of characters separated by spaces. The given text contains 82 words.

2. **Calculate the number of long words (L)**: A long word is defined as a word with more than 6 characters. Inspecting the text, the long words are: "Konceptet", "unders√∂kas", "reglera", "bypassventil", "turbinen", "dimensionera", "bypassventilens", "inverkan", "simuleringar", "validerades", "bromsning", "motorprov", "resultaten", "bromsprestanda". This totals to 14 long words.

3. **Calculate the number of sentences (S)**: A sentence typically ends with a period, exclamation mark, or question mark. The provided text contains 5 sentences.

With these numbers, we can compute the LIX score using the formula:
\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \frac{L \times 100}{W} \]

Substituting the values:
- W = 82
- S = 5
- L = 14

Now we compute:
1. \( \frac{W}{S} = \frac{82}{5} = 16.4 \)
2. \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} = \frac{14 \times 100}{82} \approx 17.07 \)

Now, summing these results:
\[ \text{LIX} = 16.4 + 17.07 \approx 33.47 \]

Thus, the final LIX readability score is:
LIX=33.47
