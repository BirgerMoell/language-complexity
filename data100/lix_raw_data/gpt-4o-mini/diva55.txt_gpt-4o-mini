To compute the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we need to analyze its components according to the LIX formula, which is defined as follows:

LIX = (A / O) + (S * 100) / A

Where:
- A = Total number of words
- O = Total number of sentences
- S = Total number of long words (words with more than 6 letters)

Now, let's break down the given text and calculate each component:

1. **Count the words (A):**
   The provided text contains 52 words.

2. **Count the sentences (O):**
   The text consists of 3 sentences.

3. **Count the long words (S):**
   Long words (more than 6 letters) in the text include:
   - befuktare (8)
   - befuktningsmetoderna (18)
   - vanligast (8)
   - befuktartyperna (13)
   - Heated (6) [not counted since it’s exactly 6]
   - Moisture (8) [not counted since it’s also not >6]
   - kondensutfällning (18)
   - tillräckliga (12)
   - temperaturnivåer (15)

   Total long words = 6

Now substitution into the LIX formula gives:

- A = 52
- O = 3
- S = 6

LIX = (52 / 3) + (6 * 100) / 52  
   = 17.333 + 11.538  
   = 28.871

Finally, rounding to the nearest whole number, we arrive at the final score. 

LIX = 29
