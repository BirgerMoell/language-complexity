To calculate the LIX (Legible Index), we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: In the provided text, there are 117 words.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as words with 6 or more letters. In the text, there are 34 long words.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: There are 5 sentences in the text.

The formula for LIX is:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \left( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \right) \]

Now we can substitute the values:

- \( W = 117 \)
- \( S = 5 \)
- \( L = 34 \)

Substituting the counts into the formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{117}{5} + \left( \frac{34 \times 100}{117} \right) \]
\[ \text{LIX} = 23.4 + \left( \frac{3400}{117} \right) \]
\[ \text{LIX} = 23.4 + 29.05 \]
\[ \text{LIX} = 52.45 \]

Rounding this to a whole number yields 52.

Thus, the calculated LIX readability score for the text is: 

LIX=52
