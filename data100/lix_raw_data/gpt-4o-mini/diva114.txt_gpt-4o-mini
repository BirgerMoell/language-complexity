To compute the LIX (LÃ¤sbarhet Index or Readability Index) score for the provided Swedish text, the following formula is used:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{(N \div M) + (K \times 100)}{N} \]

Where:
- \( N \) = total number of words in the text
- \( M \) = total number of periods in the text (sentence count)
- \( K \) = total number of long words (words with more than 6 letters)

### Step 1: Count the elements from the text.

1. **Total words (N)**: To count the words, we can split the text by spaces. The provided Swedish text has 112 words.
2. **Total sentences (M)**: We count the periods to find the number of sentences. The provided text contains 3 sentences (determined by the periods).
3. **Total long words (K)**: A long word is defined as any word with more than 6 letters. After analyzing the text, we find that there are 20 long words.

### Step 2: Plug values into the formula.

Substituting the values we found:

- \( N = 112 \)
- \( M = 3 \)
- \( K = 20 \)

Now we apply the values to the LIX formula:

\[
\text{LIX} = \frac{(112 \div 3) + (20 \times 100)}{112}
\]

Calculating the terms:

1. \( 112 \div 3 \approx 37.33 \)
2. \( 20 \times 100 = 2000 \)

So we have:

\[
\text{LIX} \approx \frac{37.33 + 2000}{112}
\]

\[
\text{LIX} \approx \frac{2037.33}{112} \approx 18.22
\]

### Final Result

After rounding, we can conclude with:

LIX = 18.2
