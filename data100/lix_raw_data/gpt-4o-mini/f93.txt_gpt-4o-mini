To compute the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we need to follow the formula:

**LIX = (number of words / number of sentences) + (number of long words * 100 / number of words)**

Where:
- A "word" is any sequence of characters that is separated by spaces.
- A "long word" is defined as any word that has more than 6 characters.

Let's analyze the text step by step.

1. **Count the Number of Words:**
   The text contains 115 words.

2. **Count the Number of Sentences:**
   The text consists of 6 sentences.

3. **Identify and Count the Long Words:**
   The long words in the text are:
   - riktig
   - fotbollsplan
   - grundidén
   - framlagd
   - folk
   - galen
   - utvecklingen
   - stannat
   - andran
   - världskriget
   - utveckling
   - kanonerna
   - skjuta
   - användning

   Counting the above, we see there are 14 long words.

Now, substituting these counts into the LIX formula:

- Number of Words (W) = 115
- Number of Sentences (S) = 6
- Number of Long Words (LW) = 14

Calculating LIX:

LIX = (W/S) + (LW * 100 / W)  
= (115 / 6) + (14 * 100 / 115)  
= 19.17 + 12.17  
= 31.34

Thus, rounding the score to two decimal places:

**LIX = 31.34**
