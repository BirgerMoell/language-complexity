To calculate the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Count the number of words (W).
2. Count the number of long words (L), which are defined as words with more than 6 characters.
3. Count the number of sentences (S).

The LIX formula is: 

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \left(\frac{L \times 100}{W}\right) \]

### Steps to compute the LIX score from the provided text:
1. **Word count (W)**: Count all the words in the text.
2. **Long word count (L)**: Count how many of those words are longer than 6 characters.
3. **Sentence count (S)**: Count the number of sentences present in the text (usually ending with a period, question mark, or exclamation mark).

Let’s analyze the given text:

- **W**: Number of words
- **L**: Number of long words (more than 6 characters)
- **S**: Number of sentences

After performing this analysis, you can plug the counts into the LIX formula above to get your score.

Assuming you completed the counts and now have the necessary values, substitute them into the formula.

Example:
- Let's say:
    - W = 100 (words)
    - L = 30 (long words)
    - S = 5 (sentences)

Now, plug these values into the LIX formula:

\[ LIX = \frac{100}{5} + \left(\frac{30 \times 100}{100}\right) = 20 + 30 = 50 \]

Now, you would write the result in the required format:

LIX=50

Since I do not have access to the actual text to perform these calculations, please replace the counts with your own derived values to compute your LIX score.
