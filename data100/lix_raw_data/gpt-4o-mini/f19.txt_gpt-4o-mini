To compute the LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: This includes all words in the text.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: A long word is defined as any word with more than 6 letters.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: This counts the total number of complete sentences in the text.

The formula for LIX is:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \left(\frac{L \times 100}{W}\right) \]

Let's analyze the text provided.

1. **Counting the words**:
   - Total words (W): 109

2. **Counting the long words**:
   - Long words (L): 20 (e.g., "solon", "arrangerad", "improvisationen", etc.)

3. **Counting the sentences**:
   - Total sentences (S): 6 

Now we plug these values into the LIX formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{109}{6} + \left(\frac{20 \times 100}{109}\right) \]

Calculating each component:

- \( \frac{109}{6} \approx 18.17 \)
- \( \frac{20 \times 100}{109} \approx 18.35 \)
  
Now adding these:

\[ \text{LIX} \approx 18.17 + 18.35 = 36.52 \]

Finally, rounding the score gives:

LIX=37
