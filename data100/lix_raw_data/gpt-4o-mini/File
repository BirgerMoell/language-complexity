To compute the LIX readability score, we will follow the formula you provided:

LIX = (number of words) / (number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (number of words)

Let's analyze the provided text step-by-step.

1. **Count the number of words**: I would count all the words in the text.
2. **Count the number of sentences**: I would count all the sentences, typically ending with punctuation marks such as periods, exclamation marks, or question marks.
3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters**: I will count each word that has more than 6 characters.

Unfortunately, you have not provided the actual Swedish text to analyze. Please provide the text, and I will carry out the analysis, calculate the LIX score accurately, and then present the final result in the required form.

If you provide the text, we can proceed with the calculation.
