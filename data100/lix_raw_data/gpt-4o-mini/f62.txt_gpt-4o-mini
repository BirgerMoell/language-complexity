To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: 
   The text has a total of 105 words.

2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: 
   Long words are defined as words with more than 6 characters. In the provided text, identifying long words like "uppsatsen", "förstå", "rasism", "existerar", "främlingsfientlighet", etc., gives us a total of 16 long words.

3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: 
   The text has 6 sentences (including the bullet points as separate sentences).

Now, plug these values into the LIX formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \left(\frac{L \times 100}{W}\right) \]

### Calculating LIX:
- \( W = 105 \)
- \( S = 6 \)
- \( L = 16 \)

Calculating \( \frac{W}{S} \):

\[ \frac{105}{6} = 17.5 \]

Calculating \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \):

\[ \frac{16 \times 100}{105} \approx 15.24 \]

Now, summing these two results:

\[ \text{LIX} = 17.5 + 15.24 \approx 32.74 \]

Finally, writing the result:

LIX=33
