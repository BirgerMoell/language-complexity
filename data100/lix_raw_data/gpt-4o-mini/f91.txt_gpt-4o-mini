To calculate the LIX (Legibility Index) readability score of the provided Swedish text, we follow this formula:

**LIX = (Number of words / Number of sentences) + (Number of long words x 100 / Number of words)**

Where:
- Long words are defined as words that have 6 or more letters.

Now, let’s analyze the text step-by-step:

1. **Count the number of words**: 
   - The text has 89 words.
   
2. **Count the number of sentences**: 
   - There are 4 sentences in the text (determined by the periods).

3. **Count the long words** (words with 6 or more letters):
   - The long words in the text are: "konstruktion", "utveckling", "elektroniska", "stor", "kraftfulla", "minimala", "beskrivning", "innehåller", "betydelse", "miljöpåverkan".
   - The total number of long words is 10.

Now, we can substitute these values into the LIX formula:

- Number of words = 89
- Number of sentences = 4
- Number of long words = 10

Calculating LIX:

1. \( \frac{Number \ of \ words}{Number \ of \ sentences} = \frac{89}{4} = 22.25 \)
2. \( \frac{Number \ of \ long \ words \times 100}{Number \ of \ words} = \frac{10 \times 100}{89} \approx 11.24 \)
3. Adding these two results: \( 22.25 + 11.24 = 33.49 \)

Finally, we round the score to whole numbers as per usual practice for LIX scores.

LIX = 33.49, which we round down to 33 for reporting purposes.

Thus, the final result is:

LIX=33
