To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: 
   The text consists of 86 words.

2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: 
   A long word is defined as a word with more than 6 letters. In this text, the long words are "databussen," "sp채nningsniv책er," "anv채ndas," "DMA-enheter," "enheter," "minnes책tkomst," "avlastar," "processor," "kontrollbuss," "undersystemen," "adressbuss," "adress," "anslutna," "lokal," and "moderkortet." Counting these gives us 15 long words.

3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: 
   The text has 5 sentences.

4. **Calculate the LIX score**: 
   The formula for LIX is:
   \[
   LIX = \frac{W}{S} + \left(\frac{L \times 100}{W}\right)
   \]

   Substituting in our counts:
   - W = 86
   - S = 5
   - L = 15

   Now plug these values into the formula:
   \[
   LIX = \frac{86}{5} + \left(\frac{15 \times 100}{86}\right)
   \]
   \[
   LIX = 17.2 + 17.44 \approx 34.64
   \]

Rounding to two decimal places gives us a final LIX score of approximately 34.64.

Thus, the LIX readability score is:

LIX=34.64
