To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text (though the text seems to be in English, I will proceed with the analysis of the text as it is presented), we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: This includes all the words in the text. 

2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as words with more than 6 letters.

3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: This counts the number of sentences present in the text.

The formula for calculating the LIX score is:
\[ \text{LIX} = \left( \frac{W}{S} \right) + \left( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \right) \]

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Count Words (W)**
   - The provided text has **86 words**.

2. **Count Long Words (L)**
   - The long words in the text include:
     - investigate
     - propose
     - working
     - increase
     - turnover
     - logistics
     - production
     - conducted
   - This gives us a total of **8 long words**.

3. **Count Sentences (S)**
   - The text has **4 sentences**.

### Applying the Formula
- Calculate \( \frac{W}{S} = \frac{86}{4} = 21.5 \)
- Calculate \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} = \frac{8 \times 100}{86} \approx 9.3 \)

Now we can put these numbers into our LIX formula:
\[ \text{LIX} = 21.5 + 9.3 = 30.8 \]

### Result
LIX=30.8
