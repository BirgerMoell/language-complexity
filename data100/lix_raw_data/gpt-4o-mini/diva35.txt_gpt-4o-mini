To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we need to follow these steps using the LIX formula:

1. **Count the number of words (W)** in the text.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: typically defined as words with more than 6 letters.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)** in the text.

The LIX formula is given by:

\[ \text{LIX} = \left( \frac{W}{S} \right) + \left( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \right) \]

Now, let's analyze the provided text:

### Step 1: Count Words (W)
The text contains 63 words.

### Step 2: Count Long Words (L)
The long words (more than 6 letters) in the text are: 
- continuation
- methodologies
- enhance
- existing
- efficient
- reliable

This makes a total of **6 long words**.

### Step 3: Count Sentences (S)
The text has **2 sentences**.

### Calculate LIX
Using the formula:

1. Calculate \( W/S \):
   \[ \frac{W}{S} = \frac{63}{2} = 31.5 \]

2. Calculate \( L \times 100/W \):
   \[ \frac{L \times 100}{W} = \frac{6 \times 100}{63} \approx 9.52 \]

3. Add the two results:
   \[ \text{LIX} = 31.5 + 9.52 \approx 41.02 \]

### Result
The calculated LIX score is approximately 41.02. Thus, in the required format:

LIX=41.02
