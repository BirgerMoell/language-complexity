To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: The total number of words in the text.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Words that are longer than 6 characters.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: The total number of sentences in the text.

The LIX formula is given by:
\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \frac{L \times 100}{W} \]

Now, let's analyze the provided text:

### Step 1: Count the number of words (W)
- Total words: 98

### Step 2: Count the number of sentences (S)
- Number of sentences: 6

### Step 3: Count the number of long words (L)
- Long words (more than 6 characters): 
  - "billigt" (7)
  - "räcker" (6) - not counted as it is not more than 6
  - "u tn y tja" (6) - not counted as it is not more than 6
  - "samarbetar" (11)
  - "sjuka" (5) - not counted
  - "friskare" (8)
  - "bygga" (5) - not counted
  - "hus" (3) - not counted
  - "gjorda" (6) - not counted
  - "gammalt" (7)
  - "förstöra" (8)
  - "miljön" (6) - not counted
  - "kretslopp" (9)
  - "människor" (9)
  - "uppmuntras" (11)
  - "livnära" (7)
  - "växter" (6) - not counted
  - "Afrikas" (7)
  - "svårt" (5) - not counted
  - "mark" (4) - not counted

Counting the long words, we get 8 long words.

### Plugging into the LIX formula:
Given our counts:
- W = 98
- S = 6
- L = 8

Let's perform the calculations:

1. \( \frac{W}{S} = \frac{98}{6} \approx 16.33 \)
2. \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} = \frac{8 \times 100}{98} \approx 8.16 \)

Combining these:
\[ \text{LIX} = 16.33 + 8.16 \approx 24.49 \]

Now, rounding to two decimal places, we get:

**Result**: 
LIX=24.49
