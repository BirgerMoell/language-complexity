To compute the LIX (Lesbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we will follow the standard formula for calculating LIX:

LIX = (A / O) + (T * 100 / S)

Where:
- A = number of words
- O = number of long words (words with more than 6 letters)
- T = number of sentences
- S = number of paragraphs

Now let's analyze the provided text:

1. **Count the number of words (A)**: 
   - The text contains **96 words**.

2. **Count the number of long words (O)**: 
   - The long words in the text (more than 6 letters): 
     - Accessories
     - workplace
     - future
     - solutions
     - activity-based
     - problems
   - Total long words: **6 long words**.

3. **Count the number of sentences (T)**: 
   - The text has **4 sentences**. (I counted by identifying sentence-ending punctuation.)

4. **Count the number of paragraphs (S)**: 
   - The text has **1 paragraph**.

Now, we can plug the values into the LIX formula:

LIX = (96 / 6) + (4 * 100 / 1)  
LIX = 16 + 400  
LIX = 416

Thus, the calculated LIX readability score for the given text is:

LIX=416
