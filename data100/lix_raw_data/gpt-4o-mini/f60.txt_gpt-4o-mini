To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)** in the text.
2. **Count the number of sentences (S)** in the text.
3. **Count the number of long words (L)**, which are defined as words with more than 6 characters.

The formula for LIX is as follows:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \frac{L \times 100}{W} \]

Now, let's analyze the provided text:

**Text Analysis**:
- Total words (W): 139
- Total sentences (S): 6
- Long words (L): 25

**Calculating LIX**:
1. Calculate \( \frac{W}{S} = \frac{139}{6} \approx 23.17 \)
2. Calculate \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} = \frac{25 \times 100}{139} \approx 17.99 \)
3. Add the two results:
   \[ \text{LIX} = 23.17 + 17.99 \approx 41.16 \]

Thus, the final LIX readability score is:

LIX=41.16
