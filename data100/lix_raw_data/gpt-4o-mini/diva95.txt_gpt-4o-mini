To compute the LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we need the following steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: This includes all lexical units separated by spaces.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are typically defined as words with more than 6 characters.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: This involves identifying the number of complete sentences, typically ending with a period, exclamation mark, or question mark.

With the provided text:

**Step 1: Count the words (W)**  
The text contains **100 words**.

**Step 2: Count the long words (L)**  
In the text, we identify the words that have more than 6 characters. For the provided text, there are **18 long words**. 

**Step 3: Count the sentences (S)**  
There are **3 sentences** in the given text. 

Using the LIX formula:
\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \frac{L \times 100}{W} \]

Plugging in our values:
- \( W = 100 \)
- \( L = 18 \)
- \( S = 3 \)

Calculating each component:
1. \( \frac{W}{S} = \frac{100}{3} = 33.33 \)
2. \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} = \frac{18 \times 100}{100} = 18 \)

Now, add these two components together:
\[ \text{LIX} = 33.33 + 18 = 51.33 \]

Finally, rounding to a whole number for the LIX score, we yield:
LIX=51.
