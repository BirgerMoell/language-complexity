To calculate the LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) score, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (N)**: The total number of words in the text.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Words that have more than 6 letters.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: The total number of sentences in the text.

### Analysis of the text:
- The text contains **40 words**.
- The long words identified are: "enjoyed", "exposure", "numerous", "articulate", "acknowledgements", "directed", "towards", "support", "comprehending", "particular", "problem", "solved", "together" (13 words).
- The text has **2 sentences**.

### Calculating the LIX score:
The formula for LIX is:
\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{N}{S} + \left(\frac{L \times 100}{N}\right) \]

Substituting the values:
- N = 40
- L = 13
- S = 2

1. Calculate \( \frac{N}{S} \):
   \[ \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

2. Calculate \( \frac{L \times 100}{N} \):
   \[ \frac{13 \times 100}{40} = 32.5 \]

3. Combine them to get the LIX score:
   \[ \text{LIX} = 20 + 32.5 = 52.5 \]

### Result:
The LIX readability score for the provided text is:
LIX=52.5
