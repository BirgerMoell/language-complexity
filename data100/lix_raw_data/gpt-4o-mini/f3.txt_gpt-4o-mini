To compute the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the total number of words (W)**: The text contains 67 words.

2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as those with more than 6 letters. 
   - The long words in the text are: "upptäckten" (11), "halvnomadiska" (13), "stammar" (7), "samlande" (8), "jordbrud" (8), "främst" (7), "kolonialstyrelsen" (17), "erövrade" (8), "intresse" (8), "koloni" (6). That gives us a total of 9 long words.

3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: The text is composed of 4 sentences.

After collecting this data, we can use the LIX formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \left(\frac{L \times 100}{W}\right) \]

Now we can plug in the values:

- \( W = 67 \) (total words)
- \( L = 9 \) (long words)
- \( S = 4 \) (sentences)

Substituting into the formula:

1. Compute \( \frac{W}{S} \):
   \[ \frac{67}{4} = 16.75 \]

2. Compute \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \):
   \[ \frac{9 \times 100}{67} \approx 13.43 \]

3. Add these two results:
   \[ 16.75 + 13.43 \approx 30.18 \]

Thus, the final LIX readability score is approximately 30.18.

Therefore, the result is:
LIX=30.18
