To compute the LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of characters (K)**: Count all letters, digits, and punctuation in the text.
2. **Count the number of words (W)**: Count all space-separated tokens, excluding punctuation or special characters.
3. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Count the number of words that have more than 6 characters.

Then, use the LIX formula:
\[
\text{LIX} = \frac{K}{W} + \frac{L \times 100}{W}
\]

Now let's compute it:

1. **Count Characters (K)**: 
   In the provided text, there are 435 characters.

2. **Count Words (W)**: 
   The text has 92 words.

3. **Count Long Words (L)**: 
   There are 19 long words.

Now we can plug these values into the LIX formula:

\[
\text{LIX} = \frac{435}{92} + \frac{19 \times 100}{92}
\]

Calculating these components:

- \( \frac{435}{92} \approx 4.73 \)
- \( \frac{19 \times 100}{92} \approx 20.65 \)

Now add these two results:

\[
\text{LIX} \approx 4.73 + 20.65 = 25.38
\]

Finally, the readability score for the given text is:

LIX=25.38
