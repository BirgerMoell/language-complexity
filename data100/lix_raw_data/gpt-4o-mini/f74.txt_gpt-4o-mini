To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow the LIX formula, which is defined as:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{(N \div M) + (K \times 100)}{L} \]

Where:
- \( N \) = number of words in the text
- \( M \) = number of sentences in the text
- \( K \) = number of long words (words with more than 6 letters)
- \( L \) = number of paragraphs in the text (usually 1 for short texts)

### Step 1: Count the Elements

1. **Number of Words (N)**: The text contains 96 words.
2. **Number of Sentences (M)**: There are 4 sentences in the text based on punctuation.
3. **Number of Long Words (K)**: Let's identify the words with more than 6 letters:

   - Behöver
   - skydd
   - miljökatastrof
   - humanitära
   - starka
   - livshotande
   - behandling
   - barnfamiljer
   - vistats
   - vistelsetiden

   There are 10 long words in total.
4. **Number of Paragraphs (L)**: There is 1 paragraph in the text.

### Step 2: Plug the Values into the Formula 

Now we can plug in the counted values into the LIX formula:

\[
\text{LIX} = \frac{(96 \div 4) + (10 \times 100)}{1}
\]
\[
= \frac{(24) + (1000)}{1} 
\]
\[
= 1024
\]

### Result

The LIX readability score for the provided text is:

**LIX=1024**
