To calculate the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W):**  
   In the provided text, I can identify 109 words.

2. **Count the number of long words (L):**  
   Long words are defined as words with more than 6 characters. In the text, there are 30 long words.

3. **Count the number of sentences (S):**  
   The text consists of 6 sentences.

Now we can use the LIX formula:  
\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \frac{L \cdot 100}{W} \]

Plugging in the values:  
- \( W = 109 \)  
- \( L = 30 \)  
- \( S = 6 \)

Calculating:  
1. Calculate \( \frac{W}{S} = \frac{109}{6} \approx 18.17 \)  
2. Calculate \( \frac{L \cdot 100}{W} = \frac{30 \cdot 100}{109} \approx 27.52 \)

Now add the two results together:  
\[ \text{LIX} = 18.17 + 27.52 \approx 45.69 \]

Thus, the final LIX readability score is:  
LIX=46
