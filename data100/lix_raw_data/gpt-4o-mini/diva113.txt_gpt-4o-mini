To compute the LIX score for the provided Swedish text, follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: This includes all the words in the text.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are typically defined as words with more than 6 characters.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: Identify how many distinct sentences are present in the text.

To analyze the provided text:

1. **Count of Words (W)**: 
   - Total words: 65

2. **Count of Long Words (L)**:
   - Long words (more than 6 characters): "consumption" (11), "significantly" (15), "necessary" (9), "identification" (14), "investigation" (11), "inspection" (10), "examination" (11), "operating" (8), "different" (9), "systems" (7).
   - Total long words: 10

3. **Count of Sentences (S)**:
   - There are 3 distinct sentences in the text.

Now, we can calculate the LIX score using the formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \left( \frac{W}{S} \right) + \left( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \right) \]

Substituting the values:

- \( W = 65 \)
- \( S = 3 \)
- \( L = 10 \)

Calculating it step-by-step:

1. Calculate \( \frac{W}{S} = \frac{65}{3} \approx 21.67 \)
2. Calculate \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} = \frac{10 \times 100}{65} = \frac{1000}{65} \approx 15.38 \)

Adding these two values together to find the LIX score:

\[ \text{LIX} \approx 21.67 + 15.38 \approx 37.05 \]

Finally, the result is:

LIX=37.05
