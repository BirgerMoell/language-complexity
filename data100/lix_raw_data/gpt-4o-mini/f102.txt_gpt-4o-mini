To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: We have a total of 69 words in the given text.

2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: A long word in LIX is defined as a word with 6 or more characters. We find 14 long words in the text: "människor", "använda", "nyckel", "sänder", "mottagaren", "hemliga", "krypteringsprogrammet", "populäraste", "program", "algoritmer", "information", "säkerhet", "säkerhets", "och".

3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: The text consists of 3 sentences.

4. **Apply the LIX formula**: LIX is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   LIX = \frac{W}{S} + \left(\frac{L \times 100}{W}\right)
   \]

   Substituting the values we found:
   - W = 69
   - L = 14
   - S = 3

   We calculate each part:
   - \(\frac{W}{S} = \frac{69}{3} = 23\)
   - \(\frac{L \times 100}{W} = \frac{14 \times 100}{69} \approx 20.29\)

   Now, we put it all together:
   \[
   LIX = 23 + 20.29 \approx 43.29
   \]

Thus, the computed score rounded to two decimal places is approximately 43.3.

Finally, the result is presented as follows:
LIX=43.3
