To calculate the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score, we need to follow a specific formula based on the number of words, sentences, and long words in the text. The formula for LIX is:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{( \text{Number of words} )}{( \text{Number of sentences} )} + \left( \frac{( \text{Number of long words} )}{( \text{Number of words} )} \times 100 \right) \]

**Definitions**: 
- A long word is defined as a word that has 6 or more letters.

Let’s analyze the provided Swedish text:

**Text:**
Keywords: initial study, object description, measures, climate shell, caution, energy, moisture,  “pay-back times”

1. **Counting Words**: 
   - Total words = 15 (including the keywords and the phrases).

2. **Counting Sentences**: 
   - The text does not contain clear sentence delimiters, treating it as a series of phrases implies it is effectively one sentence here.
   - Total sentences = 1
  
3. **Counting Long Words**: 
   - Long words (6 or more letters): "initial" (7), "description" (11), "climate" (7), "caution" (7), "moisture" (8), "pay-back" (8) -> Total long words = 6.

Now we can substitute these values into the LIX formula:

- Number of words: 15
- Number of sentences: 1
- Number of long words: 6

Now calculating LIX:

\[
\text{LIX} = \frac{15}{1} + \left( \frac{6}{15} \times 100 \right) 
\]
\[
\text{LIX} = 15 + (0.4 \times 100) 
\]
\[
\text{LIX} = 15 + 40 
\]
\[
\text{LIX} = 55 
\]

Thus, the resulting LIX score for the provided text is:

LIX=55
