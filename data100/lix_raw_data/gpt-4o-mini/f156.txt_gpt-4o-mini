To compute the LIX (Legibility Index) for the given Swedish text, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the total number of words (W)** in the text.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**, which are defined as words with more than 6 characters.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)** in the text.

The formula for LIX is:
\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \left(\frac{L \times 100}{W}\right) \]

Let's analyze the provided text:

1. **Word Count (W)**: The text contains **82 words**.
2. **Long Words Count (L)**: The long words (more than 6 characters) in the text are:
   - "kusterna" (8)
   - "gratis" (6, not counted)
   - "fiske" (5, not counted)
   - "fiskekort" (9)
   - "cirka" (5, not counted)
   - "miljon" (6, not counted)
   - "besökt" (6, not counted)
   - "fritids" (7)
   - "oftast" (6, not counted)
   - "foreller" (8)
   - "öring" (5, not counted)
   - "naturens" (8)
   - "egen" (4, not counted)
   - "fiskaren" (8)
   - "nöjes" (5, not counted)
   - "fiskenationer" (14)
   - "Nordsjön" (7)
   - "Nordatlanten" (12)
   - "tillhör" (7)
   - "världens" (7)
   - "fiskevatten" (10)

   So we count a total of **9 long words**.
3. **Sentence Count (S)**: The text contains **5 sentences**.

Now substituting the values into the LIX formula:
- W = 82
- L = 9
- S = 5

Now we calculate LIX:
\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{82}{5} + \left(\frac{9 \times 100}{82}\right) \]
\[ \text{LIX} = 16.4 + \left(\frac{900}{82}\right) \]
\[ \text{LIX} = 16.4 + 10.98 \]
\[ \text{LIX} \approx 27.38 \]

Thus, rounding to a meaningful decimal, we conclude:

LIX=27.4
