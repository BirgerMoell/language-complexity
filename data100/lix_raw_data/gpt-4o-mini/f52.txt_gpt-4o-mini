To compute the LIX (Lesbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: The total number of words in the text.

2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are typically defined as words with more than 6 letters.

3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: The total number of sentences in the text.

The LIX formula is as follows:
\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \left(\frac{L \times 100}{W}\right) \]

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Count the words (W)**:
   The text contains 32 words.

2. **Count the long words (L)**:
   The long words, which have more than 6 letters, are:
   - Operativsystemets (17)
   - uppgift (7)
   - övervaka (8)
   - program (7)
   - används (7)
   - ”samsas” (7)
   - datorns (7)
   - resurser (8)
   - nätverk (7)
   - hårddisk (8)
   - terminaler (9)
   - tangentbord (10)
   - processoranvänding (17)
   - minne (6) (not counted as it has 6 letters)
   
   In total, we have 12 long words.

3. **Count the sentences (S)**:
   The text contains 1 sentence.

### Final Calculation:
Using the counts:
- \( W = 32 \)
- \( L = 12 \)
- \( S = 1 \)

Now we substitute these values into the LIX formula:
\[
\text{LIX} = \frac{32}{1} + \left(\frac{12 \times 100}{32}\right) 
\]
\[
\text{LIX} = 32 + \left(\frac{1200}{32}\right) 
\]
\[
\text{LIX} = 32 + 37.5 
\]
\[
\text{LIX} = 69.5 
\]

Finally, rounding the score to a whole number, we get:

LIX = 70.
