To compute the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we need to follow the LIX formula:

LIX = (number of words / number of sentences) + (number of long words * 100 / number of words)

Where:
- A long word is defined as having more than 6 characters.

Now let’s analyze the text step-by-step:

1. **Count the words**: 
   The text contains 94 words.

2. **Count the sentences**: 
   The text contains 5 sentences (determined by the number of periods or full stops).

3. **Count the long words**: 
   Long words (more than 6 characters):
   - moderkortets (12)
   - huvudsakliga (12)
   - absolut (8)
   - viktigaste (10)
   - delar (6) (not counted since it’s not more than 6)
   - metallplatta (11)
   - anslutna (8)
   - installera (10)
   - räcker (6) (not counted since it’s not more than 6)
   - dotterkort (9)

   Total long words = 8. 

Now, we can plug these values into the LIX formula:

- Number of words = 94
- Number of sentences = 5
- Number of long words = 8

Calculating LIX:

LIX = (94 / 5) + (8 * 100 / 94)

Calculating each term:

- First term: 94 / 5 = 18.8
- Second term: (8 * 100) / 94 ≈ 8.51

Now adding these two terms together:

LIX = 18.8 + 8.51 ≈ 27.31

Thus, the final LIX readability score is:

**LIX=27.31**
