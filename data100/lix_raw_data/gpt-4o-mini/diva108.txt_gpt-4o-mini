To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: This includes all words in the text.
2. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: This includes all complete sentences.
3. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Words with more than 6 characters are considered long words.

The LIX formula is defined as follows:

\[ \text{LIX} = \left(\frac{W}{S}\right) + \left(\frac{L \times 100}{W}\right) \]

### Step-by-step Calculation

1. **Count the words (W)**:
   - The entire text contains 153 words.

2. **Count the sentences (S)**:
   - There are 3 complete sentences in the text.

3. **Count the long words (L)**:
   - Long words in the text: "Rising", "combined", "increasing", "environmental", "consciousness", "building", "render", "timely", "certification", "efficiency", "presented", "investigated", "businesses", "appeared", "certification", "market", "place", "customers", "building", "owners", "agents", "control" - 20 long words in total.

### Plugging in the values:

- W = 153
- S = 3
- L = 20

### LIX Calculation

\[ \text{LIX} = \left(\frac{153}{3}\right) + \left(\frac{20 \times 100}{153}\right) \]

Calculating each part:
- \( \frac{153}{3} = 51 \)
- \( \frac{20 \times 100}{153} \approx 13.07 \)

Now add those results:
\[ \text{LIX} = 51 + 13.07 \approx 64.07 \]

### Final result

Since LIX scores are usually rounded to the nearest whole number, we round 64.07 to 64.

LIX=64
