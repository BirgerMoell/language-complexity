To calculate the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex, or Readability Index) score for the given Swedish text, we follow the formula:

**LIX = (number of words / number of sentences) + (number of long words × 100 / number of words)**

Where:
- **Number of words**: Total number of words in the text.
- **Number of sentences**: Total number of sentences in the text.
- **Long words**: Words with more than 6 characters.

Let's analyze the text step-by-step:

1. **Count the words**: 
   The text has 124 words.

2. **Count the sentences**: 
   The text contains 6 sentences.

3. **Count the long words**: 
   The long words (more than 6 characters) in the text are:
   - "Nigeria" (6 characters, not counted)
   - "störst" (6 characters, not counted)
   - "invånare" (8 characters)
   - "människor" (9 characters)
   - "koncentreras" (12 characters)
   - "områden" (7 characters)
   - "subsahariska" (13 characters)
   - "största" (7 characters)
   - "städer" (6 characters, not counted)
   - "halv" (4 characters, not counted)
   - "kvinnor" (7 characters)
   - "befolkningen" (12 characters)
   - "population" (9 characters)

   Counting these, we find a total of 8 long words.

Now, we plug the values into the LIX formula:

- Number of words = 124
- Number of sentences = 6
- Number of long words = 8

Calculating LIX:

LIX = (124 / 6) + (8 × 100 / 124)

Let's compute it step by step:
1. \( 124 / 6 = 20.67 \) (approximately)
2. \( 8 × 100 = 800 \)
3. \( 800 / 124 = 6.45 \) (approximately)

Now, add these two results together:
LIX ≈ 20.67 + 6.45 = 27.12

Rounding to the nearest whole number gives us 27.

The final LIX readability score for the text is:

**LIX=27**
