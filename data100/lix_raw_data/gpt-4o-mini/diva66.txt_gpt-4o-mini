To compute the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: The total number of words in the text.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: A long word is defined as any word containing 7 or more letters.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: The total number of sentences in the text.

The LIX formula is:

\[ LIX = \frac{W}{S} + \left( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \right) \]

Let's analyze the text step by step.

### Step 1: Count the elements
- **Text**: Most of today's building damages can be linked to moisture. Moisture also plays a significant role in health problems related to indoor climate. Building physics is despite this rarely discussed seriously during the building design phase. Possible reasons include unclear responsibilities; short-term economic focus; a fragmentized building process; and lack of proper training and competence.

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: 
   - Total words = 51.

2. **Count the number of long words (L)**:
   - Long words (7+ letters): "damages," "moisture," "significant," "problems," "indoor," "discussed," "design," "responsibilities," "fragmentized," "training," and "competence."
   - There are 11 long words in total.

3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: 
   - Total sentences = 5 (each sentence ends with a period or semicolon).

### Step 2: Plug into the LIX formula
\[ LIX = \frac{W}{S} + \left( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \right) \]

Substituting in the values:
- W = 51
- S = 5
- L = 11

Calculating:

1. **Calculate W/S**:
   \[
   \frac{51}{5} = 10.2
   \]

2. **Calculate (L × 100) / W**:
   \[
   \frac{11 \times 100}{51} \approx 21.57
   \]

3. **Calculate LIX**:
   \[
   LIX = 10.2 + 21.57 \approx 31.77
   \]

### Step 3: Write the result
The final LIX readability score is approximately 31.77.

Thus, we conclude with:

LIX=31.77
