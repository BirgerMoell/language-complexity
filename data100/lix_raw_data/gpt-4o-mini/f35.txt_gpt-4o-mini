To compute the LIX readability score for the given Swedish text, we need to follow the formula:

LIX = (number of words / number of sentences) + (number of long words × 100 / number of words)

**Step 1: Count the words, sentences, and long words.**

1. **Words**: The provided text consists of 88 words.
2. **Sentences**: There are 4 sentences present in the text.
3. **Long words**: We define long words as those containing 6 or more letters. Counting through the text, the following long words can be identified:
   - moderkortets (12)
   - moderkortet (11)
   - absolut (7)
   - viktigaste (10)
   - metallplatta (12)
   - anslutna (8)
   - installera (10)
   - räcker (6)
   - kort (4)
   - istället (8)
   - dotterkort (10)

   In total, there are 10 long words.

**Step 2: Apply the formula.**

Now we can input our counts into the LIX formula:
- Number of words = 88
- Number of sentences = 4
- Long words = 10

LIX = (88 / 4) + (10 × 100 / 88)  
LIX = 22 + (1000 / 88)  
LIX = 22 + 11.36  
LIX ≈ 33.36

**Final Result:**
After rounding, the LIX score is approximately 33.

LIX=33
