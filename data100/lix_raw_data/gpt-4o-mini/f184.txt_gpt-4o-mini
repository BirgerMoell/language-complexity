To compute the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex), we will use the formula:

LIX = (Number of words / Number of sentences) + (Number of long words * 100 / Number of words)

Where:
- A long word is defined as having more than 6 characters.

Let’s analyze the given text step by step. 

1. **Count the number of words**: 
   The text has 113 words.

2. **Count the number of sentences**: 
   The text consists of 5 sentences. 

3. **Count the number of long words**: 
   The long words in the text are:
   - lurar (6 characters)
   - buskarna (8 characters)
   - handlingskraftiga (18 characters)
   - katastrofer (11 characters)
   - växer (6 characters)
   - på (2 characters)
   - orolig (6 characters)
   - ungdom (6 characters)
   - internatskola (13 characters)

   The long words are: "buskarna", "handlingskraftiga", "katastrofer", "internatskola". This gives us 4 long words.

Now, substituting these values into the LIX formula:

- Number of words = 113
- Number of sentences = 5
- Number of long words = 4

LIX = (113 / 5) + (4 * 100 / 113)
LIX = 22.6 + 3.54 (approximately)
LIX ≈ 26.14

Thus, rounding this to two decimal points, we get the final score. 

The final LIX readability score is:

LIX=26.14
