To calculate the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: The text contains a total of 91 words.

2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as words that have more than 6 letters. In this text, the following words are longer than 6 letters:
   - "minidator"
   - "kylskåp"
   - "terminaler"
   - "ersatta"
   - "persondatorer"
   - "stordatorer"
   - "billigare"
   - "behändigare"
   - "alternativ"
   - "framgångsrikt"
   - "marknadsför"
   - "minidatorer"
   - "Digital"
   - "tidigt"

   This gives us a total of 14 long words.

3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: The text consists of 5 sentences.

Now, we put these numbers into the LIX formula:

\[ LIX = \left( \frac{W}{S} \right) + \left( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \right) \]

Substituting the counts we have:

- W = 91
- L = 14
- S = 5

Now calculate each part:

1. \( \frac{W}{S} = \frac{91}{5} = 18.2 \)
2. \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} = \frac{14 \times 100}{91} \approx 15.38 \)

Now, combine these to get the final LIX score:

\[ LIX = 18.2 + 15.38 = 33.58 \]

Finally, we round to the nearest whole number, resulting in:

LIX=34
