To compute the LIX (Lesbarhetsindex) readability score from the provided Swedish text, we follow the formula:

**LIX = (A / O) + (K * 100)**

Where:  
- **A** is the number of words in the text.
- **O** is the number of long words (words with more than 6 characters).
- **K** is the number of sentences in the text.

Letâ€™s analyze the given text step by step:

1. **Count the Number of Words (A):**  
   The text contains 75 words in total.

2. **Count the Number of Long Words (O):**  
   We need to count words longer than 6 characters:
   - Measurements (11)
   - Temperature (10)
   - Humidity (8)
   - Moisture (7)
   - Change (6)
   - Climate (7)
   - Dependent (8)
   - Differences (10)

   Long words are: (Measurements, Temperature, Humidity, Moisture, Dependent, Differences)  
   Total long words (O) = 6.

3. **Count the Number of Sentences (K):**  
   The text consists of 4 sentences.

Now we can plug these values into the LIX formula:

1. A = 75  
2. O = 6  
3. K = 4  

**Now substituting these values into the LIX formula:**

LIX = (75 / 6) + (4 * 100)  
LIX = 12.5 + 400  
LIX = 412.5

Therefore, the calculated LIX readability score is:

LIX=412.5
