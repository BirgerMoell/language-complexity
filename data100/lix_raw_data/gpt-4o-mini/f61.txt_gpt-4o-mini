To compute the LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)** in the text.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**, defined as words containing more than 6 characters.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)** in the text.

### Step 1: Count the components
- The total number of words (W) in the text is **119**.
- The number of long words (L) is **27**.
- The number of sentences (S) is **5**.

### Step 2: Calculate LIX
The LIX formula is given by:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \left( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \right) \]

### Plugging in the values:
1. Calculate \( \frac{W}{S} \):
\[ \frac{119}{5} = 23.8 \]

2. Calculate \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \):
\[ \frac{27 \times 100}{119} \approx 22.69 \]

3. Combine the two results to get the LIX score:
\[ \text{LIX} = 23.8 + 22.69 = 46.49 \]

### Final Result
Rounding to one decimal place gives us:

LIX = 46.5
