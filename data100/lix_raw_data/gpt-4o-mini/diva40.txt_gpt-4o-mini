To calculate the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: A word is defined as any sequence of characters separated by spaces.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: A long word is defined as any word containing more than 6 characters.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: A sentence is any sequence of words ending with a full stop, question mark, or exclamation mark.

Once we have these counts, we can apply the LIX formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \left(\frac{L \times 100}{W}\right) \]

### Step 1: Analysis of the Text

1. **Count the Words (W)**: 
   - The text contains 71 words.

2. **Count the Long Words (L)**: 
   - Long words (more than 6 characters): 
     - "proposed" (8), "technical" (9), "solution" (8), "insulation" (10), "standards" (9), "influenced" (10), "disadvantage" (13), "technique" (9), "carpenters" (10), "requires" (8), "concurrently" (12), "aspects" (8).
   - Total long words: 12.

3. **Count the Sentences (S)**: 
   - The text contains 5 sentences.

### Step 2: Apply the LIX Formula

- Using the counts:
  - W = 71
  - L = 12
  - S = 5

Now insert these values into the LIX formula:

\[
\text{LIX} = \frac{71}{5} + \left(\frac{12 \times 100}{71}\right)
\]

Calculating each part:

1. \(\frac{71}{5} = 14.2\)
2. \(\frac{12 \times 100}{71} \approx 16.9\)

Now combine these two results:
\[
\text{LIX} \approx 14.2 + 16.9 = 31.1
\]

### Result

Therefore, the readability score of the provided Swedish text is:

LIX=31.1
