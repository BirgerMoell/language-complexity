To compute the LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W):** We count each word in the text. In this case, there are 90 words in total.

2. **Count the number of long words (L):** Long words are defined as words that have 7 characters or more. In the text, we identify the long words. After analysis, there are 20 long words.

3. **Count the number of sentences (S):** We identify complete sentences by counting sentence-ending punctuation (periods, exclamation points, etc.). The text contains 4 sentences.

Using the LIX formula:
\[ \text{LIX} = \left( \frac{W}{S} \right) + \left( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \right) \]

Now we can substitute the counts we obtained into the formula:

- \( W = 90 \)
- \( L = 20 \)
- \( S = 4 \)

First, we calculate \( \frac{W}{S} \):
\[ \frac{90}{4} = 22.5 \]

Next, we calculate \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \):
\[ \frac{20 \times 100}{90} = \frac{2000}{90} \approx 22.22 \]

Now we add these two results together:
\[ \text{LIX} = 22.5 + 22.22 \approx 44.72 \]

Finally, we round the score appropriately, which gives us an LIX score of about 45.

Thus, we present the final result as:
**LIX=45**
