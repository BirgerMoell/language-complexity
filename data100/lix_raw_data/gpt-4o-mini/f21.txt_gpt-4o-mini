To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we first need to follow the formula for LIX:

LIX = (Number of words / Number of sentences) + (Number of long words * 100 / Number of words)

Where:
- A long word is typically defined as a word with more than 6 characters.

Now, let’s analyze the provided text:

1. **Count the number of words**: The text contains 79 words.
2. **Count the number of sentences**: There are 4 sentences in the text.
3. **Count the number of long words**: Identifying long words (more than 6 characters):
   - Socialdemokraterna (16)
   - rösta (5)
   - riksdagens (10)
   - kammaren (8)
   - lyckades (8)
   - kvinnorna (8)
   - socialdemokratiska (20)

   Total long words = 7

Now, let's calculate using the LIX formula:

LIX = (79 / 4) + (7 * 100 / 79)

Calculating each part:

1. Number of words / Number of sentences = 79 / 4 = 19.75
2. Number of long words * 100 / Number of words = 7 * 100 / 79 ≈ 8.86

Now, combine these:
LIX = 19.75 + 8.86 ≈ 28.61 

So, rounding off, we can state:

LIX = 29

Therefore, the final score is:

LIX=29
