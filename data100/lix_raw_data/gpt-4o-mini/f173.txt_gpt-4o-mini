To calculate the LIX (Readability Index) score for the provided Swedish text, we follow the LIX formula:

**LIX = (number of words / number of sentences) + (number of long words × 100 / number of words)**

1. **Count the components:**
   - **Total words**: We count every word in the text, including articles and conjunctions.
   - **Total sentences**: Sentences end with punctuation marks like . or ?.
   - **Long words**: Words with more than 6 letters are considered long.

**Text Analysis:**
- **Total words**: 75
- **Total sentences**: 5
- **Long words**: There are 14 long words in the text: "medelstora" (10), "cirklande" (9), "nyttjande" (9), "intresserade" (12), "svängande" (9), "lockande" (8), "närmade" (8), "stötte" (6), "maskenHär" (10), "användas" (8), "list" (4), "tänkte" (6), "blänket" (7), "röding" (6).

**Calculating Long Words:**
For our analysis, we should focus only on unique instances, although the total for long words in general counts toward the final computation.

After tabulating:
- Long Words: 14

2. **Plugging values into the formula:**
   - Number of words = 75
   - Number of sentences = 5
   - Number of long words = 14

Now, we insert these into the LIX formula:

LIX = (75 / 5) + (14 × 100 / 75)  
LIX = 15 + (1400 / 75)  
LIX = 15 + 18.67  
LIX = 33.67

3. **Final LIX Result:**
Since LIX scores are typically rounded to two decimal places, we present it as:

LIX = 33.67
