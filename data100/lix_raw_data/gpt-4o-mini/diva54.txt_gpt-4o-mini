To calculate the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we need to follow a specific formula:

LIX = (number of words / number of sentences) + (number of long words * 100 / number of words)

1. **Count the necessary components:**
   - **Total number of words**: Count all the words in the text.
   - **Total number of sentences**: Count the number of sentences in the text (ending with periods).
   - **Number of long words**: Count the words with more than 6 letters.

2. **Total counts from the text:**
   - The provided text consists of **107 words**.
   - There are **5 sentences** (each ending with a period).
   - The number of long words (more than 6 letters) is **16**.

3. **Now plug these numbers into the LIX formula:**
   - LIX = (107 / 5) + (16 * 100 / 107)

4. **Calculate LIX step by step:**
   - First part: \( 107 / 5 = 21.4 \)
   - Second part: \( 16 * 100 = 1600 \)
   - Now compute: \( 1600 / 107 ≈ 14.95 \)
   - Thus, part two contributes approximately \( 14.95 \).
   - Add both parts together: \( 21.4 + 14.95 ≈ 36.35 \)

5. **Final Score:**
   - LIX ≈ 36.35

So the result is:

LIX=36.35
