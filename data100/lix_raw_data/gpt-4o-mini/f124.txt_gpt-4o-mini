To compute the LIX (L채sbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we can follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: This includes all types of words.  
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as words with more than 6 characters.  
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: This is the total number of sentences in the text.

The formula for LIX is as follows:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \left(\frac{L \cdot 100}{W}\right) \]

### Step-by-Step Calculation

1. **Counting the Words (W):**
   - The text has a total of 77 words.

2. **Counting the Long Words (L):**
   - Long words (more than 6 characters) in the text: "Danmark" (8), "Ryssland" (8), "30-책riga" (8), "slutade" (7), "Westfaliska" (12), "freden" (6), "Problemet" (9), "svenska" (7), "vapen" (5), "teknik" (6), "v채lutvecklad" (12), "smida" (5), "j채rn" (4), "vallonerna" (10).
   - Total long words (L) = 10.

3. **Counting the Sentences (S):**
   - The text contains 5 sentences.

### Now plug the values into the LIX formula:

- \( W = 77 \)
- \( L = 10 \)
- \( S = 5 \)

Calculating:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{77}{5} + \left(\frac{10 \cdot 100}{77}\right) \]

Calculating each part:

- \( \frac{77}{5} = 15.4 \)
- \( \frac{10 \cdot 100}{77} \approx 12.99 \)

Now add them:

\[ \text{LIX} = 15.4 + 12.99 \approx 28.39 \]

### Final Result
LIX=28.39
