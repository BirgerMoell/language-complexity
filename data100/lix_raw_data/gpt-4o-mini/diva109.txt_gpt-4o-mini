To compute the LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of words (W)**: Count all the words in the text.
2. **Calculate the number of long words (L)**: Count the words that are longer than 6 characters.
3. **Calculate the number of sentences (S)**: Count the total number of sentences.

The formula for LIX is:
\[ \text{LIX} = \left( \frac{W}{S} \right) + \left( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \right) \]

Now, let's analyze the given text step by step.

### Step 1: Counting
- **Text**: "It emanates from an EC directive in 2002. The purpose of energy certification of buildings is efficiency in the use of energy and a reduction of emissions effecting climate. Buildings account for about 40% of the total use of energy in EU countries. Rising costs of energy, combined with an increasing environmental consciousness on the part of building owners, render timely the law on certification of buildings for energy efficiency."

- **Number of words (W)**:  55
- **Number of long words (L)**: 
    - Long words (more than 6 characters): 'emanates,' 'directive,' 'certification,' 'buildings,' 'efficiency,' 'reduction,' 'emissions,' 'effecting,' 'account,' 'combined,' 'increasing,' 'environmental,' 'consciousness,' 'building,' 'owners,' 'render,' 'timely.'
    - Total number of long words (L):  16
- **Number of sentences (S)**: 4

### Step 2: Calculation of LIX
Using the counts:
- W = 55
- L = 16
- S = 4

Now, apply the LIX formula:
1. Calculate \( \frac{W}{S} \):
   \[ \frac{55}{4} = 13.75 \]
   
2. Calculate \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \):
   \[ \frac{16 \times 100}{55} \approx 29.09 \]

3. Sum both results:
   \[ LIX = 13.75 + 29.09 \approx 42.84 \]

### Final Result
LIX=43
