To calculate the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) score for the provided Swedish text, we can follow the standard formula:

LIX = (A / O) + (G * 100 / A)

Where:
- A = the total number of words
- O = the total number of long words (words longer than 6 letters)
- G = the total number of sentences

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Count the Total Words (A)**:
   - The provided text has 97 words.

2. **Count the Number of Long Words (O)**:
   - Long words (more than 6 letters): 
     - fascinerad (10)
     - intressanta (10)
     - hela (4)
     - tidsepoken (10)
     - därför (6)
     - skriva (6)
     - historia (7)
     - bredare (7)
     - kunskap (8)
     - kommer (6)
     - fortsatta (8)
     - letat (5)
   - Total long words: 10.

3. **Count the Total Sentences (G)**:
   - The text consists of 4 sentences.

### Plugging the Values into the Formula:
- A = 97
- O = 10
- G = 4

Now we substitute these values into the LIX formula:

LIX = (A / O) + (G * 100 / A)  
LIX = (97 / 10) + (4 * 100 / 97)  
LIX = 9.7 + (400 / 97)  
LIX ≈ 9.7 + 4.12  
LIX ≈ 13.82

### Final Result
LIX = 13.82

However, as LIX scores are often reported without decimals, we can round it to:

LIX = 14.
