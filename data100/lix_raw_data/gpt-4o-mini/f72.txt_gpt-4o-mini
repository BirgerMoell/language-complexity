To compute the LIX ( Läsbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: This includes all the words in the text. In your case, the entire text provided has 81 words.

2. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: A sentence is typically defined as a phrase that ends with a period, exclamation mark, or question mark. There are 8 sentences in the text.

3. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as words with 7 or more letters. In this text, the words that qualify are: "skillnader", "färgen", "pigment", "förtryckta", "egentligen", "källförteckning", "inledning", "övervinner", and "fördomar". This gives a total of 9 long words.

Now, we can compute the LIX score using the formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \frac{L \times 100}{W} \]

Substituting the counts into the formula:

- W = 81
- S = 8
- L = 9

Calculating:

1. First part: \( \frac{W}{S} = \frac{81}{8} = 10.125 \)
2. Second part: \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} = \frac{9 \times 100}{81} = \frac{900}{81} \approx 11.11 \)

Now, adding these two parts together:

\[ \text{LIX} = 10.125 + 11.11 \approx 21.235 \]

For practical purposes, we can round this value to two decimal places.

Thus, the final score will be:

**LIX=21.24**
