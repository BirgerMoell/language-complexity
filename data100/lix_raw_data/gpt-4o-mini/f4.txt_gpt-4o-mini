To compute the LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: A total of 94 words in the text.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as words with more than 6 letters. By analyzing the text, we find there are 29 long words.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: The text contains 5 sentences.

Now we can apply the LIX formula:

\[
\text{LIX} = \left( \frac{W}{S} \right) + \left( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \right)
\]

Substituting the values we have:

- \( W = 94 \)
- \( S = 5 \)
- \( L = 29 \)

Calculating the components:

1. \( \frac{W}{S} = \frac{94}{5} = 18.8 \)
2. \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} = \frac{29 \times 100}{94} \approx 30.85 \)

Now, adding these components to find the LIX score:

\[
\text{LIX} = 18.8 + 30.85 \approx 49.65
\]

Finally, rounding the score to the nearest whole number:

\[
\text{LIX} = 50
\]

Thus, the LIX readability score for the text is:

**LIX=50**
