To compute the LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of characters (C)**: This includes all letters, punctuation marks, and spaces.
2. **Count the number of words (W)**: This is the total number of words in the text.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: This involves identifying the number of complete sentences.

The formula for calculating the LIX is:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{C}{W} + \left( \frac{W}{S} \times 100 \right) \]

Where:
- C = number of characters
- W = number of words
- S = number of sentences

Now, let's analyze the provided text.

### Step 1: Count Characters (C)
The text has **488 characters** (including spaces).

### Step 2: Count Words (W)
The text has **96 words**.

### Step 3: Count Sentences (S)
The text has **5 sentences**.

### Now, we can calculate LIX.
First, plug the counts into the formula:

1. Calculate \( \frac{C}{W} \):
   \[
   \frac{488}{96} \approx 5.0833
   \]

2. Calculate \( \frac{W}{S} \):
   \[
   \frac{96}{5} = 19.2
   \]

3. Now, multiply that by 100:
   \[
   19.2 \times 100 = 1920
   \]

4. Finally, add the two results together to compute LIX:
   \[
   \text{LIX} = 5.0833 + 1920 \approx 1925.0833
   \]

To report as a single value:
Round to the nearest whole number (if desired, but typically in readability scores, we keep the decimal places for more precision), and write as:

**LIX = 1925.08** (if rounding is not performed, you can retain more decimal places as applicable).

Hence the final readability score is:

**LIX=1925.08**
