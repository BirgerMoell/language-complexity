To calculate the LIX readability score, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the total number of words (W)**: Each word is counted, including conjunctions, prepositions, and other small words.

2. **Count the total number of sentences (S)**: These are distinct declarative segments ending in periods, exclamation marks, or question marks.

3. **Count the total number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as those containing 7 or more letters.

The LIX score is calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \left( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \right) \]

Now, let’s analyze the provided text:

**Text**:
```
Especially, I want to thank
- My academic supervisor Martin Törngren who, despite a heavy workload, have contributed with a lot of valuable feedback and help with this thesis.
- My supervisors at Regin: Anders Ågren who have been supporting and supplying me with the adequate software tools to be able to debug the implementation.
- Lars Matsson for helping me with code optimization and the temporary fixes to produce a lean Regio firmware.
```

### Step 1: Count the words (W)
The total number of words in the text is 67.

### Step 2: Count the sentences (S)
The text consists of three distinct sentences (as indicated by full stops at the end).

### Step 3: Count the long words (L)
The long words (7 or more letters) in the text are:
- Especially
- academic
- supervisor
- contributed
- valuable
- feedback
- adequate
- software
- supporting
- supplying
- debugging
- optimization
- temporary
- produce
- firmware

This results in a total of **15 long words**.

### Now, using the LIX formula:

- \( W = 67 \)
- \( S = 3 \)
- \( L = 15 \)

Plugging the values into the formula:
\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{67}{3} + \left(\frac{15 \times 100}{67}\right) \]

Calculating:
\[ \text{LIX} = 22.33 + \left(\frac{1500}{67}\right) \]
\[ \text{LIX} = 22.33 + 22.39 \]
\[ \text{LIX} \approx 44.72 \]

Rounding to a reasonable decimal point, we get:

**Result**: LIX=44.7
