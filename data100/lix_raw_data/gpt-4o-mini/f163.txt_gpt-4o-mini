To calculate the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex), we use the following formula:

\[ LIX = \frac{\text{number of words}}{\text{number of sentences}} + \left(\frac{\text{number of long words}}{\text{number of words}} \times 100\right) \]

Where:
- "long words" are defined as words with more than 6 letters.
- "number of words" is the total count of words in the text.
- "number of sentences" is the total count of sentences in the text.

### Step-by-step Analysis:

1. **Count the number of words**:
   - The total number of words in the provided text is 122.

2. **Count the number of sentences**:
   - The sentences in the text are separated by periods. There are 5 sentences in total.

3. **Count the number of long words**:
   - Long words (more than 6 letters) in the text are:
     - sporten (7)
     - populär (7)
     - kraftigaste (11)
     - utövare (8)
     - yngre (6, not counted)
     - 2000-talet (10)
     - större (6, not counted)
     - fiskegrenarna (12)
     - rykte (6, not counted)
     - materiell (9)
     - sport/hobby (11)
     - behövs (6, not counted)
   - The total number of long words identified is 9.

### Now plug these values into the LIX formula:

1. **Calculate the first part**:
   \[ \frac{122 \, \text{words}}{5 \, \text{sentences}} = 24.4 \]

2. **Calculate the second part**:
   \[ \frac{9 \, \text{long words}}{122 \, \text{words}} \times 100 \approx 7.38 \]

3. **Add both parts together**:
   \[ LIX = 24.4 + 7.38 \approx 31.78 \]

### Final Result:
Rounding the LIX score to a more standard format gives us:

LIX=32
