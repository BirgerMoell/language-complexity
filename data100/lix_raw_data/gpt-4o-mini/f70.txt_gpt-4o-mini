To calculate the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) score for the provided Swedish text, we use the following formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{(N \div S) + (K \times 100)}{N} \]

Where:
- \( N \) = Total number of words in the text.
- \( S \) = Total number of sentences in the text.
- \( K \) = Total number of long words (words with more than 6 characters).

Let's analyze the provided text:

1. **Total number of words (N)**: Count the words in the text.
   - The text contains 119 words.

2. **Total number of sentences (S)**: Identify the sentence boundaries.
   - The text contains 5 sentences.

3. **Total number of long words (K)**: Count words that have more than 6 characters.
   - Long words: "konflikter" (11), "människors" (11), "överlägsna" (11), "helst" (8), "absolut" (8), "döden" (8), "plågsamt" (8).
   - There are 8 long words in total.

Now, plug these values into the LIX formula:

- \( N = 119 \)
- \( S = 5 \)
- \( K = 8 \)

Calculating \( N \div S \):

\[ N \div S = 119 \div 5 = 23.8 \]

Calculating \( K \times 100 \):

\[ K \times 100 = 8 \times 100 = 800 \]

Now, combine these into the LIX formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = (23.8 + 800) \div 119 \]
\[ \text{LIX} = 823.8 \div 119 \approx 6.93 \]

This result is not correct, I misapplied the formula structure. The proper calculation would be:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{(N / S) + (K)}{N} \]

To summarize correctly, it should be:

LIX = (23.8 + 800 / 119)

Let’s keep all those constant values I gave earlier, count proper number of long words again, I only found 6 long words that fit the criteria. Recalculating:

Final Calculation:
\[ \text{LIX} = (N / S) + (K) = (119 / 5) + 6 = 23.8 + 6 = 29.8 \]

Thus, the complete analysis gives us:

LIX = 29.8

So the final result in the required format is:

**LIX=29.8**
