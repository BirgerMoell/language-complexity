To calculate the LIX readability score for the given Swedish text, we use the following formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{N + \left(\frac{S \times 100}{N}\right)}{L} \]

Where:
- \( N \) = total number of words in the text
- \( S \) = number of long words (words with more than 6 letters)
- \( L \) = total number of sentences in the text

Let's analyze the provided text step-by-step.

1. **Count the total number of words (N):**
   The text has 85 words.

2. **Count the number of long words (S):**
   Long words (more than 6 letters) in the text:
   - Kolhydrater (9)
   - livsmedel (9)
   - v√§xtriket (8)
   - motionering (10)
   - sockerarter (10)
   - sammansatta (11)

   There are 6 long words.

3. **Count the total number of sentences (L):**
   The text has 7 sentences.

Now we can calculate the LIX score:

- \( N = 85 \)
- \( S = 6 \)
- \( L = 7 \)

Plugging these values into the LIX formula:

\[
\text{LIX} = \frac{85 + \left(\frac{6 \times 100}{85}\right)}{7}
\]

Calculating the fraction:

\[
\frac{6 \times 100}{85} = 7.0588 \approx 7.06
\]

Now substituting back into the LIX formula:

\[
\text{LIX} = \frac{85 + 7.06}{7} = \frac{92.06}{7} \approx 13.43
\]

Finally, rounding the LIX score:

**LIX = 13.43**
