To compute the LIX (Läsbarhet Index) score for the provided text, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: This includes all words in the text. 

2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are typically defined as words with more than 6 characters.

3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: This counts the total number of sentences in the text.

**Now, let's analyze the provided text:**

Text: "The empirical investigation is primary based upon qualitative interviews with public officials in seven Swedish municipalities. The study concludes in that ‘a sense of place’ as defined within the study, is highly relevant and present in Swedish municipal planning practice."

### Step 1: Count Elements

- **Total Number of Words (W)**: 43
- **Total Number of Sentences (S)**: 2
- **Long Words (L)**: Count the words that have more than 6 characters.

   Long words in the text: 
   - empirical 
   - investigation 
   - qualitative 
   - interviews 
   - municipalities 
   - concludes 
   - relevant 
   - present 
   - municipal 
   - planning 
   - practice 

   Count of long words (L): 11

### Step 2: LIX Calculation

The LIX formula is as follows:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \left(\frac{L \times 100}{W}\right) \]

Substituting the values we've counted:

- \( W = 43 \)
- \( S = 2 \)
- \( L = 11 \)

Now plug these into the formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{43}{2} + \left(\frac{11 \times 100}{43}\right) \]

Calculate:

1. \( \frac{43}{2} = 21.5 \)
2. \( \frac{11 \times 100}{43} = \frac{1100}{43} \approx 25.58 \)

Now combine these results:

\[ \text{LIX} = 21.5 + 25.58 \approx 47.08 \]

### Result

Overall, the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text is:

**LIX=47.08**
