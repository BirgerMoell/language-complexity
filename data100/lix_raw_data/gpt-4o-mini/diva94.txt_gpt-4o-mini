To compute the LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex or Readability Index) score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: This includes all words in the text. The provided text contains 86 words.

2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as words with more than 6 characters. By analyzing the text, there are 16 long words.

3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: We identify sentences by looking for periods, which signify sentence boundaries. The text contains 5 sentences.

Now we can calculate the LIX score using the formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \frac{L \cdot 100}{W} \]

Substituting the values we counted:

- \( W = 86 \)
- \( L = 16 \)
- \( S = 5 \)

Calculating the components:

1. \( \frac{W}{S} = \frac{86}{5} = 17.2 \)
2. \( \frac{L \cdot 100}{W} = \frac{16 \cdot 100}{86} \approx 18.6 \)

Now, adding these two results together:

\[ \text{LIX} = 17.2 + 18.6 = 35.8 \]

Hence, the final LIX readability score is:

LIX=36
