To calculate the LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, follow these steps:

1. **Count the Number of Words (N)**: The total number of words in the text.
2. **Count the Number of Long Words (L)**: Words with more than 6 characters are considered long words.
3. **Count the Number of Sentences (S)**: The number of sentences in the text.

### Step-by-Step Calculation
1. **Word Count (N)**: The provided text has 85 words.
2. **Long Word Count (L)**: There are 21 long words in the text.
3. **Sentence Count (S)**: The text has 4 sentences.

### LIX Formula
The LIX score is computed using the formula:
\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{N}{S} + \frac{L \times 100}{N} \]

### Plugging in the Values
- \( N = 85 \)
- \( L = 21 \)
- \( S = 4 \)

Now, substituting these values into the formula:

1. Calculate \( \frac{N}{S} \):
   \[
   \frac{85}{4} = 21.25
   \]

2. Calculate \( \frac{L \times 100}{N} \):
   \[
   \frac{21 \times 100}{85} = \frac{2100}{85} \approx 24.71
   \]

3. Adding these two components together:
   \[
   \text{LIX} = 21.25 + 24.71 \approx 45.96
   \]

### Final Result
Thus, the LIX score for the provided text is:
LIX=46
