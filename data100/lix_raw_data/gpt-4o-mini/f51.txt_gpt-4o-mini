To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (N)**: The text contains a total of 115 words.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as words longer than 6 letters. In this text, there are 39 long words.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: There are 5 sentences in the text.

The formula for calculating the LIX score is as follows:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{N}{S} + \frac{L \cdot 100}{N} \]

Now we can plug the values into the formula:

- \( N = 115 \)
- \( S = 5 \)
- \( L = 39 \)

Calculating each part:

1. **Calculate \( \frac{N}{S} \)**: 
   \[ \frac{115}{5} = 23 \]

2. **Calculate \( \frac{L \cdot 100}{N} \)**:
   \[ \frac{39 \cdot 100}{115} \approx 33.91 \]

3. **Combine the results**:
   \[ \text{LIX} = 23 + 33.91 \approx 56.91 \]

Thus, rounding to two decimal points, the final score for the provided text would be:

LIX=56.91
