To calculate the LIX (Lesbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided text, I will follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: Total number of words in the text.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as words with more than 6 characters.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: Total number of sentences in the text.

The LIX formula is:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \frac{L \times 100}{W} \]

**Step 1: Count the Words (W)**  
The provided text has 109 words.

**Step 2: Count the Long Words (L)**  
The long words in the text are:
- considered
- developing
- different
- changing
- environmental
- studied
- framework
- compliance
- jurisdiction
- technology
- company (occurs multiple times, but counted only once as long)
  
Counting these, we find **11 long words**.

**Step 3: Count the Sentences (S)**  
The text consists of 5 sentences. 

Now, we can plug the values into the LIX formula:

- \( W = 109 \)
- \( L = 11 \)
- \( S = 5 \)

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{109}{5} + \frac{11 \times 100}{109} \]

Calculating each term:

1. \( \frac{109}{5} = 21.8 \)
2. \( \frac{11 \times 100}{109} = \frac{1100}{109} \approx 10.09 \)

Then we sum these results:

\[ \text{LIX} = 21.8 + 10.09 = 31.89 \]

Now rounding to a more suitable readability score, we get:

### Final Score
LIX = 32
