**Calculating the LIX readability score:**

1. Number of words: 60
2. Number of sentences: 6
3. Number of words longer than 6 letters: 52

**Formula:** LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)

**Calculation:** LIX = (60/6) + (52*100/60) = 10 + 86.67 = **96.67**

**Result:** LIX= 96.67
