**Analysis of the text:**

* Number of words: 33
* Number of sentences: 4
* Number of words longer than 6 letters: 20

**Calculation of LIX score:**

```
LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
LIX = 33/4 + 20*100/33
LIX = 9.75 + 60.61
LIX = 70.36
```

**Result:**

LIX = 70.36
