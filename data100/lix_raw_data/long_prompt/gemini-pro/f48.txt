**Analysis:**

**Number of words:** 52
**Number of sentences:** 6
**Number of words longer than 6 letters:** 26

**LIX Calculation:**

```
LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
```

```
LIX = (52/6) + (26*100/52)
LIX = 8.67 + 50
LIX = 58.67
```

**Result:**

LIX = 58.67
