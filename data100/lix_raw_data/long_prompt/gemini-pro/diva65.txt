**Analysis**

* Number of words: 60
* Number of sentences: 5
* Number of words longer than 6 letters: 44

**LIX Calculation**

LIX = (60 / 5) + (44 * 100 / 60)
LIX = 12 + 73.33
**LIX = 85.33**

**Explanation**

1. Divide the number of words (60) by the number of sentences (5) to get 12.
2. Multiply the number of words longer than 6 letters (44) by 100 and divide by the number of words (60) to get 73.33.
3. Add the results of steps 1 and 2 (12 + 73.33) to get 85.33.

**Result**

LIX = 85.33
