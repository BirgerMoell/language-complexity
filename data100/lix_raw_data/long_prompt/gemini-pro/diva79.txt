**Text analysis:**

- Number of words: 48
- Number of sentences: 3
- Number of words longer than 6 letters: 37

**LIX score calculation:**

LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
LIX = (48)/3 + (37)*100/(48)
LIX = 16 + 77.08
**LIX = 93.08**
