**Analysis:**

**Number of words:** 41
**Number of sentences:** 6

**Number of words longer than 6 letters:** 26

**LIX calculation:**

```
LIX = (number of words) / (number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (number of words)
LIX = (41) / (6) + (26) * 100 / (41)
LIX = 6.83 + 63.41
LIX = 70.24
```

**Result:**

LIX = 70.24
