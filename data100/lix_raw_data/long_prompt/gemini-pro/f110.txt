**Number of words:** 50
**Number of sentences:** 5
**Number of words longer than 6 letters:** 32

**Step 1: (number of words)/(number of sentences)**
50 / 5 = 10

**Step 2: (number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)**
32 * 100 / 50 = 64

**Step 3: Combine both steps**
10 + 64 = 74

**LIX = 74**
