**Word count:** 24
**Number of periods:** 1 (indicates the end of a sentence)
**Number of words longer than 6 letters:** 6 (different, responsible, minimum, should, however, number)
**LIX calculation:**
```
LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
LIX = 24/1 + 600/24
LIX = 24 + 25
LIX = 49
```

**Result:** LIX=49
