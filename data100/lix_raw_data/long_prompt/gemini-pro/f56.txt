**Analysis:**

* Total number of words: 95
* Total number of sentences: 7
* Number of words longer than 6 letters: 52

**LIX calculation:**

LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)

LIX = 95/7 + 52*100/95
LIX = 13.57 + 54.73
LIX = **68.3**

**Result:**

LIX = 68.3
