**Analyze the text:**

- Number of words: 67
- Number of sentences: 6
- Number of words longer than 6 letters: 35

**Compute the LIX readability score:**

LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
LIX = 67/6 + 35*100/67
LIX = 11.17 + 52.24
**LIX = 63.41**
