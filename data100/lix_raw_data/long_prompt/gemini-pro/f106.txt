**Word count:** 74
**Sentence count:** 5
**Words longer than 6 letters:** 45

**LIX calculation:**
```
LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
```
```
LIX = (74)/5 + (45)*100/(74)
```
```
LIX = 14.8 + 60.8
```
```
LIX = 75.6
```

**Result: LIX=75.6**
