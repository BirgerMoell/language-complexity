**Word count:** 46
**Sentence count:** 7

**Calculator:**

```
LIX = (words / sentences) + ((words over 6 letters) * 100 / words)
```

**Input:**

```
words = 46
sentences = 7
words over 6 letters = 42 (manually counted)
```

**LIX Calculation:**

```
LIX = (46 / 7) + ((42) * 100 / 46)
LIX = 6.57 + 91.30
LIX = 97.87
```

**Result:**

LIX = 97.87
