**Analysis:**

* Number of words: 94
* Number of sentences: 11
* Number of words longer than 6 letters: 71

**LIX calculation:**

LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
LIX = (94/11) + (71*100)/94
LIX = 8.545 + 75.532
LIX = **37.04**

**Result:**

LIX = 37.04
