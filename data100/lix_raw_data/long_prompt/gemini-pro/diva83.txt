1. **Count the number of words:** 45
2. **Count the number of sentences:** 4
3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters:** 32

**LIX calculation:**

```
LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)

LIX = (45)/4 + (32)*100/45
LIX = 11.25 + 71.11
LIX = 82.36
```

**Result:**

LIX = 82.36
