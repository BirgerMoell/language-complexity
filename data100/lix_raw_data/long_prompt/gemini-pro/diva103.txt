**Number of words:** 42
**Number of sentences:** 5
**Number of words longer than 6 letters:** 23

**LIX = ((number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words))**

```
LIX = ((42)/5) + ((23)*100)/42
LIX = 8.4 + 54.76
LIX = 63.16
```

Therefore, **LIX= 63.16**.
