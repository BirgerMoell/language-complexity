The text contains the following number of words and sentences:

* Words: 68
* Sentences: 7

The text contains the following number of words longer than 6 letters:

* Words longer than 6 letters: 24

Using the LIX formula, we can calculate the LIX score as follows:

```
LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
```

```
LIX = 68/7+(24*100)/68
```

```
LIX = 9.71+35.29
```

```
LIX = 45
```

Therefore, the LIX readability score for the given Swedish text is **LIX=45**.
