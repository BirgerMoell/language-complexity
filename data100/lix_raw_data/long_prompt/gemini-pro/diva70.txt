**Step 1: Count the number of words and sentences**

* Number of words: 51
* Number of sentences: 5

**Step 2: Count the number of words longer than 6 letters**

* Words longer than 6 letters: 20

**Step 3: Calculate the LIX score**

```
LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
```

```
LIX = 51/5 + 20*100/51
```

```
LIX = 10.2 + 39.2157
```

```
LIX = 49.4157
```

**Result:**

LIX = 49.42
