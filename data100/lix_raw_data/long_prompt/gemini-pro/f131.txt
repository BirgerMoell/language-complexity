**Analysis:**

* Number of words: 63
* Number of sentences: 6
* Number of words longer than 6 letters: 46

**LIX Calculation:**

```
LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
```

```
LIX = 63/6 + 46*100/63
```

```
LIX = 10.5 + 73.02
```

**Result:**

```
LIX = 83.52
```
