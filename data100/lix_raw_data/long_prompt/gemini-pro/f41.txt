**Number of words:** 65
**Number of sentences:** 6
**Number of words longer than 6 letters:** 44

**(number of words)/(number of sentences) = 65/6 = 10.83**
**((number of words longer than 6 letters)*100)/(number of words) = (44*100)/65 = 67.69**
**LIX = 10.83 + 67.69 = 78.52**

Therefore, the LIX readability score of the text is **LIX=78.52**.
