**Number of words:** 29

**Number of sentences:** 5

**Number of words longer than 6 letters:** 23

**LIX calculation:**
```
LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
LIX = (29/5) + (23*100/29)
LIX = 5.8 + 79.31
LIX = 85.11
```

**Result:**
LIX=85.11
