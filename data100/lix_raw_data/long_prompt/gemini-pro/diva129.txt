**Number of words:** 50
**Number of sentences:** 5
**Number of words longer than 6 letters:** 32

**LIX = ((number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words))**

```
LIX = ((50/5)+(32*100/50))
LIX = (10)+(64)
LIX = 74
```

**Therefore, the LIX readibility score is LIX=74.**
