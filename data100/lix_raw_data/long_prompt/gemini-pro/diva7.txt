**Analysis of the text:**

* Number of words: 75
* Number of sentences: 5
* Number of words longer than 6 letters: 38

**LIX calculation:**

```
LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
LIX = (75/5)+(38*100)/75
LIX = 15 + 50.67
LIX = 65.67
```

**Result:**

LIX = 65.67
