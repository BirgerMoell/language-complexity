**Text analysis:**

* Number of words: 58
* Number of sentences: 6
* Number of words longer than 6 letters: 44

**LIX calculation:**

LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
LIX = 58/6 + (44*100)/58
LIX = 9.67 + 75.86
LIX = 18.54

**Result:**

LIX = 18.54
