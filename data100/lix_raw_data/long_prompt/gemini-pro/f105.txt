**Number of words:** 64
**Number of sentences:** 5
**Number of words longer than 6 letters:** 40

**LIX calculation:**

```
(number of words)/(number of sentences) = 64/5 = 12.8
(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words) = 40*100/64 = 62.5
```

**LIX score:**

```
12.8 + 62.5 = 75.3
```

Therefore, the LIX readability score of the text is LIX=75.3.
