**Analysis:**

* Number of words: 65
* Number of sentences: 5
* Number of words longer than 6 letters: 35

**Calculation:**

```
LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
LIX = 65/5 + 35*100/65
LIX = 13 + 53.85 = 66.85
```

**Result:**

LIX = 66.85
