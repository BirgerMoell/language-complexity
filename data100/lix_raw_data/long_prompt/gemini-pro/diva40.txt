**Step 1: Count the number of words.**

* "The proposed technical solution is building with studs of steel and only using three layers of insulation in the walls." = 17 words
* "New standards from The National board of housing, building and planning has influenced the proposal of steel studs." = 13 words
* "The disadvantage is that the technique of building with steel studs is often new to carpenters and thus requires more time." = 19 words
* "The passive house concept is also new." = 5 words
* "As follows, two new aspects concurrently come into play." = 8 words

**Total number of words:** 62

**Step 2: Count the number of sentences.**

* There are 5 sentences in the text.

**Step 3: Count the number of words longer than 6 letters.**

* "proposed" (7 letters)
* "technical" (8 letters)
* "solution" (7 letters)
* "building" (7 letters)
* "studs" (5 letters)
* "steel" (5 letters)
* "insulation" (10 letters)
* "walls" (5 letters)
* "standards" (8 letters)
* "National" (8 letters)
* "housing" (7 letters)
* "planning" (8 letters)
* "influenced" (9 letters)
* "proposal" (8 letters)
* "disadvantage" (10 letters)
* "technique" (8 letters)
* "carpenters" (9 letters)
* "requires" (8 letters)
* "passive" (7 letters)
* "concept" (7 letters)
* "follows" (7 letters)
* "aspects" (7 letters)
* "concurrently" (11 letters)

**Total number of words longer than 6 letters:** 24

**Step 4: Calculate the LIX readibility score.**

```
LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
LIX = 62/5+(24*100)/62
LIX = 12.4+38.71
LIX = 51.11
```

**Result:**

LIX = 51.11
