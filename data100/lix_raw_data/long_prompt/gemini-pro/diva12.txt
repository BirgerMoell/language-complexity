**Analysis:**

* Number of words: 40
* Number of sentences: 3
* Number of words longer than 6 letters: 25

**LIX Calculation:**

LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
LIX = (40/3) + (25*100/40)
LIX = 13.33 + 62.5
**LIX = 75.83**

Therefore, the LIX readibility score of the given Swedish text is 75.83.
