**Analysis:**

* Number of words: 63
* Number of sentences: 5
* Number of words longer than 6 letters: 35

**LIX calculation:**

```
LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
```

```
LIX = 63/5 + 35*100/63
```

```
LIX = 12.6 + 55.56
```

```
LIX = 68.16
```

**Result:**

LIX = 68.16
