**Analysis:**

* Number of words: 58
* Number of sentences: 7
* Number of words longer than 6 letters: 44

**LIX calculation:**

```
LIX = ((number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words))
LIX = ((58/7)+(44*100)/58)
LIX = (8.2857)+(75.8621)
LIX = 84.1478
```

**Result:**

LIX=84.15
