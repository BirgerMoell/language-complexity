**Analysis:**

* Number of words: 15
* Number of sentences: 1
* Number of words longer than 6 letters: 7

**Calculation:**

LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
LIX = 15/1 + 7*100/15
LIX = 15 + 46.67
LIX = **61.67**

**Result:**

LIX = 61.67
