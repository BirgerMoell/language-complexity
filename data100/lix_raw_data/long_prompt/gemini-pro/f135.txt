**Analysis:**

* Number of words: 84
* Number of sentences: 5
* Number of words longer than 6 letters: 60

**LIX calculation:**

LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)

LIX = (84)/(5)+(60)*100/(84)

**Calculator steps:**

```
84 รท 5 = 16.8
60 ร 100 = 6000
6000 รท 84 = 71.43
16.8 + 71.43 = 88.23
```

**Result:**

LIX = 88.23
