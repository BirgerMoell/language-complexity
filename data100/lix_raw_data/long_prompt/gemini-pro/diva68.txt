**Analysis:**

**Number of words:** 54
**Number of sentences:** 2
**Number of words longer than 6 letters:** 28

**LIX calculation:**

LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
LIX = (54) / (2) + (28) * 100 / (54)
LIX = 27 + 51.85
**LIX = 51.85**

**Explanation:**

1. We counted the number of words in the text: 54.
2. We counted the number of sentences in the text: 2.
3. We counted the number of words longer than 6 letters in the text: 28.
4. We used the LIX formula to calculate the LIX score: 51.85.

**Result:**

LIX = 51.85
