**Analysis of the text:**

* Number of words: 64
* Number of sentences: 7
* Number of words longer than 6 letters: 29

**Calculation of LIX readability score:**

LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
LIX = (64)/7+(29)*100/(64)
LIX = 9.14+45.31
**LIX = 54.45**
