1. **Count the number of words.** There are 74 words in the text.
2. **Count the number of sentences.** There are 5 sentences in the text.
3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters.** There are 41 words longer than 6 letters in the text.
4. **Compute the LIX score using the formula:** (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
5. **Calculate the LIX score:** (74/5) + (41*100/74) = 14.8 + 55.41 = 70.21
6. **Write the result:** LIX=70.21
