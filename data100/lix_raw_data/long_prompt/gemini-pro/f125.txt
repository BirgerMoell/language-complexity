**Word count:** 75
**Sentence count:** 8
**Words longer than 6 letters:** 47

**LIX calculation:**

```
LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)

LIX = 75/8 + (47*100)/75

LIX = 9.375 + 62.67

LIX = 72.05
```

**Result:**

LIX = 72.05
