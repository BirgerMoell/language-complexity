**Analysis**

* **Word count:** 28
* **Sentence count:** 3
* **Words longer than 6 letters:** 11

**LIX Calculation**

```
LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
```

```
LIX = (28/3) + (11 * 100/28)
```

```
LIX = 9.33 + 39.29
```

```
LIX = 48.62
```

**Result**

LIX = 48.62
