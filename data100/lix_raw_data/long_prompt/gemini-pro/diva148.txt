**Analysis:**

* Number of words: 56
* Number of sentences: 6
* Number of words longer than 6 letters: 46

**Calculation:**

LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)

LIX = (56)/6 + (46)*100/(56)
LIX = 9.33 + 82.14
LIX = **91.47**

**Result:**
LIX = 91.47
