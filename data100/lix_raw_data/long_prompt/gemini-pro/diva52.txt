**Number of words:** 73
**Number of sentences:** 5
**Number of words longer than 6 letters:** 46

**LIX calculation:**
```
LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
```

```
LIX = (73)/5 + (46)*100/73
```

```
LIX = 14.6 + 63.0137
```

```
LIX = 77.6137
```

**Result:** LIX=77.6137
