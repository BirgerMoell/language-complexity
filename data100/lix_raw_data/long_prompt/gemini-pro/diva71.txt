**Calculating LIX**

**Number of words:** 96

**Number of sentences:** 4

**Number of words longer than 6 letters:** 61

**LIX = ((number of words)/(number of sentences)) + ((number of words longer than 6 letters)*100)/(number of words)**

**LIX = ((96/4)) + ((61*100)/96) = 24 + 63.54**

**LIX = 87.54**

**Result:**

LIX = 87.54
