**Analysis:**

* Number of words: 82
* Number of sentences: 5
* Number of words longer than 6 letters: 48

**LIX Calculation:**

```
LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
LIX = 82/5 + 48*100/82
LIX = 16.4 + 58.54
LIX = 74.94
```

**Result:**

LIX = 74.94
