**Steps for calculating the LIX score:**

1. **Count the number of words:** There are 119 words in the Swedish text.
2. **Count the number of sentences:** There are 6 sentences in the text.
3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters:** 78 out of the 119 words are longer than 6 letters.

**Calculation:**

LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
LIX = 119/6 + 78*100/119
LIX = 19.83 + 65.55
**LIX = 85.38**
