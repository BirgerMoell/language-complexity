**Number of words:** 93
**Number of sentences:** 6
**Number of words longer than 6 letters:** 58

**LIX calculation:**
```
LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
LIX = 93/6 + (58*100)/93
LIX = 15.5 + (5800)/93
LIX = 15.5 + 62.37
LIX = 77.87
```

**Result:**
LIX = 77.87
