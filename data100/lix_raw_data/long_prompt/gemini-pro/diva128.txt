**Number of words:** 30
**Number of sentences:** 5
**Number of words longer than 6 letters:** 21

**LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)**

**LIX = (30/5) + (21*100/30)**

**LIX = 6 + 70**

**LIX = 76**

Therefore, the LIX readability score for the given Swedish text is 76.
