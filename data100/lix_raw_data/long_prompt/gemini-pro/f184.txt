**Number of words:** 50
**Number of sentences:** 6
**Number of words longer than 6 letters:** 30

**LIX calculation:**

```
LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
LIX = 50/6 + 30*100/50
LIX = 8.33 + 60
LIX = 68.33
```

**Result:**

LIX = 68.33
