**Number of words:** 75

**Number of sentences:** 6

**Number of words longer than 6 letters:** 48

**LIX calculation:**

LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
LIX = (75)/(6) + (48)*100/(75)
LIX = **48.46**

**Result:**

LIX = 48.46
