**Analysis:**

* Number of words: 76
* Number of sentences: 7
* Number of words longer than 6 letters: 46

**Calculation:**

LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
LIX = 76/7 + 46*100/76
LIX = 10.857 + 60.526
LIX = 71.383

**Result:**

LIX = 71.383
