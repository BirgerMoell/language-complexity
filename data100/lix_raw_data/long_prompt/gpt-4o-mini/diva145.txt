To calculate the LIX (Readability Index) score for the provided Swedish text, we will follow the formula you provided: 

LIX = (number of words) / (number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (number of words)

**Step 1: Count the number of words.**
- The provided text has the following words:
  "The measurements to be performed in the attics were air temperature, relative humidity, moisture ratio and air change rate. Since the climate in the attics is dependent on the outdoor climate, it was decided that outdoor climate data would be collected as well. Moisture ratios of similar points in the different objects were measured in order to estimate the cause of these differences."

Total number of words = 56

**Step 2: Count the number of sentences.**
- The text consists of 3 sentences.
1. "The measurements to be performed in the attics were air temperature, relative humidity, moisture ratio and air change rate."
2. "Since the climate in the attics is dependent on the outdoor climate, it was decided that outdoor climate data would be collected as well."
3. "Moisture ratios of similar points in the different objects were measured in order to estimate the cause of these differences."

Total number of sentences = 3

**Step 3: Count the number of words longer than 6 letters.**
- Long words:
  1. measurements (11)
  2. performed (9)
  3. temperature (10)
  4. humidity (8)
  5. moisture (7)
  6. dependent (9)
  7. decided (7)
  8. collected (8)
  9. moisture (7)
  10. different (9)
  11. measured (7)
  12. estimate (8)
  13. differences (11)

Total number of words longer than 6 letters = 13

**Step 4: Substitute the values into the LIX formula.**
LIX = (number of words) / (number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (number of words)  
LIX = (56) / (3) + (13) * 100 / (56)

**Calculating the two components:**
1. First component: 56 / 3 = 18.67
2. Second component: (13 * 100) / 56 = 23.21

Now, adding those two results together:
LIX = 18.67 + 23.21 = 41.88

**Final Result:**
LIX = 41.88

To format the result as requested:
LIX=41.88
