To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we first need to identify the number of words, the number of sentences, and the number of words longer than 6 letters.

### Step 1: Count the Components

1. **Number of Words**: 
   - The text provided is: "Keywords: initial study, object description, measures, climate shell, caution, energy, moisture, 'pay-back times'"
   - Counting the words: "Keywords", "initial", "study", "object", "description", "measures", "climate", "shell", "caution", "energy", "moisture", "pay-back", "times"
   - Total words: 13

2. **Number of Sentences**: 
   - The text does not have any traditional sentence structures (e.g., ending with a period). However, we can consider the text as a single sentence because it showcases keywords.
   - Total sentences: 1

3. **Number of Words Longer Than 6 Letters**:
   - Looking through the list: "initial" (7), "description" (11), "measures" (8), "climate" (7), "caution" (7), "moisture" (8), "pay-back" (8) (considering 'pay-back' as a single word)
   - Total words longer than 6 letters: 7

### Step 2: Calculate the LIX Score

Using the LIX formula:
\[
LIX = \frac{(\text{number of words})}{(\text{number of sentences})} + \frac{(\text{number of words longer than 6 letters}) \times 100}{(\text{number of words})}
\]

Plugging in the values we counted:
- Number of words = 13
- Number of sentences = 1
- Number of words longer than 6 letters = 7

Substituting into the formula:

1. Calculate the first part:
   \[
   \frac{13}{1} = 13
   \]

2. Calculate the second part:
   \[
   \frac{7 \times 100}{13} \approx \frac{700}{13} \approx 53.85
   \]

3. Add the two parts together:
   \[
   LIX \approx 13 + 53.85 = 66.85
   \]

### Final Result
Thus, the LIX readability score for the provided text is:
LIX=66.85
