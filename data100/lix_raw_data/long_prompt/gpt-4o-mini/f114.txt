To calculate the LIX readability score from the provided Swedish text, we must follow the formula outlined. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Count the number of words**: 
   - The provided text has 83 words.

2. **Count the number of sentences**: 
   - The text has 5 sentences. (Each sentence ends with a period.)

3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters**:
   - The words longer than 6 letters in the text are: "början" (7), "destruktiva" (12), "skämtsamma" (11), "effekt" (6), "spridning" (9), "datasystem" (11), and "döda" (4).
   - This gives us a total of 5 words that are longer than 6 letters.

Now, we can apply the LIX formula:

LIX = (number of words / number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters * 100 / number of words)

Plugging in the numbers:

LIX = (83 words / 5 sentences) + (5 words longer than 6 letters * 100 / 83 words)

Calculating each part:

- First part: \( \frac{83}{5} = 16.6 \)
- Second part: \( \frac{5*100}{83} = \frac{500}{83} \approx 6.02 \)

Now, adding the two results together to calculate the LIX:

LIX = 16.6 + 6.02 ≈ 22.62

Finally, rounding off to two decimal places, we present the LIX score:

**LIX=22.62**
