To calculate the LIX readability score of the provided Swedish text, we need to follow the formula provided:

LIX = (number of words) / (number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (number of words)

1. **Count the number of words:**
   - The text consists of 83 words.

2. **Count the number of sentences:**
   - The text contains 5 sentences.

3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters:**
   - The longer words in the text are:
     - Förmögna (8)
     - undervisas (10)
     - föräldrar (9)
     - lärare (7)
     - andra (6)
     - flotta (6)
     - plebejer (8)
     - hantverkare (12)
     - arbetare (8)
   - Total words longer than 6 letters: 6

Now we can plug these values into the LIX formula:

- LIX = (number of words) / (number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (number of words)

Substituting the values we counted:

- LIX = (83) / (5) + (6 * 100) / (83)
- LIX = 16.6 + (600 / 83)
- LIX = 16.6 + 7.23
- LIX = 23.83

After rounding the score to two decimal points, we get:

**LIX = 23.83**
