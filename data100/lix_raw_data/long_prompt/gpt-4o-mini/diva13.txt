To calculate the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we first need to break down the components required for the formula:

1. **Number of words (W)**: Count all the words in the text.
2. **Number of sentences (S)**: Count all the individual sentences.
3. **Number of words longer than 6 letters (L)**: Count only the words that have more than 6 letters.

Let's analyze the text step by step:

### Text Analysis
Here is the provided text broken down:

“The purpose of this study was to investigate and propose a new working method to increase the turnover rate of the ready stock in Zwolle. This led to questions about how the outbound logistics is planned in Zwolle today, and how it can be planned in the future with increased production volumes. The study was limited to cover chassis for direct delivery markets in Europe. First to get a holistic overview of the conditions, a mapping of the current situation was conducted.”

1. **Count the words (W)**: 
   - Total number of words: 88

2. **Count the sentences (S)**:
   - The text consists of 4 sentences. 

3. **Count the words longer than 6 letters (L)**: 
   - There are several words longer than 6 letters: 
     - investigate 
     - propose 
     - working 
     - increase 
     - turnover 
     - outbound 
     - logistics 
     - planned  
     - production 
     - deliveries 
     - holistic
     - overview 
     - conditions 
     - mapping 
     - current 
     - situation 
   - Total: 15 words longer than 6 letters.

### Final Calculation
Now we can substitute these values into the LIX formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \frac{L \times 100}{W} \]

Using the values we have:
- W = 88
- S = 4
- L = 15

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{88}{4} + \frac{15 \times 100}{88} \]
\[ \text{LIX} = 22 + \frac{1500}{88} \]
\[ \text{LIX} \approx 22 + 17.04 \]
\[ \text{LIX} \approx 39.04 \]

### Final Result
After rounding, the LIX readability score can be presented as follows:

LIX=39.04
