First, let's break down the provided Swedish text step by step to compute the LIX readability score.

**Step 1: Count the total number of words.**
The given text consists of the following words:
"The", "idea", "for", "my", "thesis", "began", "to", "emerge", "last", "year", "when", "I", "was", "studying", "as", "an", "exchange", "student", "in", "the", "US", "in", "west", "coast", "city", "Seattle", "The", "city", "is", "currently", "growing", "and", "densifying", "in", "a", "rapid", "pace", "and", "most", "of", "the", "new", "buildings", "are", "being", "built", "in", "existing", "environments", "The", "vast", "majority", "is", "creating", "big", "contrasts", "in", "the", "city", "environment".

This gives us a total of 63 words.

**Step 2: Count the number of sentences.**
The text contains the following sentences:
1. "The idea for my thesis began to emerge last year when I was studying as an exchange student in the US, in west coast city Seattle."
2. "The city is currently growing and densifying in a rapid pace and most of the new buildings are being built in existing environments."
3. "The vast majority is creating big contrasts in the city environment."

This gives us a total of 3 sentences.

**Step 3: Count the number of words longer than 6 letters.**
The long words in the text are:
1. "exchange" (8 letters)
2. "student" (7 letters)
3. "currently" (9 letters)
4. "growing" (7 letters)
5. "densifying" (11 letters)
6. "existing" (8 letters)
7. "environments" (11 letters)
8. "majority" (8 letters)
9. "creating" (8 letters)
10. "contrasts" (9 letters)
11. "environment" (11 letters)

This gives us a total of 11 words that are longer than 6 letters.

**Step 4: Plug the numbers into the LIX formula:**
LIX = (number of words / number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters * 100 / number of words)

We can substitute the numbers we calculated:
- Number of words = 63
- Number of sentences = 3
- Number of words longer than 6 letters = 11

Now, calculating LIX:
1. Number of words / number of sentences = 63 / 3 = 21
2. Number of words longer than 6 letters * 100 / number of words = (11 * 100) / 63 ≈ 17.46

Now summing both parts:
LIX = 21 + 17.46 ≈ 38.46

**Final Result:**
LIX=38.46
