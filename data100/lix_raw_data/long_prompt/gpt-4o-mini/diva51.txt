To calculate the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score for the given Swedish text, we need to follow the formula you provided. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Count the number of words**: We need to find out how many words are in the text. 
   - The provided text contains **116 words**.

2. **Count the number of sentences**: We need to determine how many sentences are in the text. Sentences are generally separated by periods.
   - The provided text contains **4 sentences**.

3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters**: Next, we need to identify how many of the words in the text have more than 6 letters.
   - Here are the words longer than 6 letters:
     - "undersökas" (10)
     - "bypassventil" (12)
     - "dimensionera" (12)
     - "tillverkning" (12)
     - "bypassventilens" (14)
     - "inverkan" (8)
     - "simuleringar" (12)
     - "validerades" (12)
     - "konceptet" (9)
     - "bromsning" (9)
     - "motorprov" (8)
     - "avgasbromsprestanda" (20)

   - Total number of words longer than 6 letters = **12**

4. **Applying the LIX formula**: 
   - \( \text{LIX} = \left( \frac{\text{number of words}}{\text{number of sentences}} \right) + \left( \frac{\text{number of words longer than 6 letters} \times 100}{\text{number of words}} \right) \)

   Substituting the values we found:
   - \( \text{LIX} = \left( \frac{116}{4} \right) + \left( \frac{12 \times 100}{116} \right) \)

   Now calculating each part:
   - \( \frac{116}{4} = 29 \)
   - \( \frac{12 \times 100}{116} = \frac{1200}{116} \approx 10.34 \)

   Therefore,
   - \( \text{LIX} \approx 29 + 10.34 \approx 39.34 \)

5. **Final score**: Rounding this result, we would represent it with some precision.

Thus, the final readability score is:

**LIX=39.34**
