To calculate the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we need to follow the formula:

LIX = (number of words / number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters * 100 / number of words)

Let's break down the text and compute the required quantities step by step.

1. **Count the number of words**: 
   - The provided text has 106 words.

2. **Count the number of sentences**:
   - The text consists of 4 sentences. (Each sentence can be identified by the presence of periods or other terminating punctuation marks).

3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters**:
   - The words longer than 6 letters in the text are:
     - Regeringen (10)
     - krigsutbrottet (14)
     - anslå (7)
     - pengar (6)
     - försvaret (8)
     - tillskott (8)
     - hög (3)
     - brister (7)
     - stridsvagnsbataljon (18)
     - endast (6)
     - anslagen (8)
     - hunnit (6)
     - saknades (8)
     - material (8)

   - In total, the words longer than 6 letters are:
     - Regeringen, krigsutbrottet, anslå, försvaret, tillskott, brister, stridsvagnsbataljon, anslagen, saknades, material.
   - This gives us a total of 10 words longer than 6 letters.

Now we have:
- Total number of words = 106
- Total number of sentences = 4
- Total number of words longer than 6 letters = 10

Now, we can plug these values into the LIX formula:

LIX = (106 / 4) + (10 * 100 / 106)

Calculating each part:

1. \(106 / 4 = 26.5\)
2. \(10 * 100 / 106 = 1000 / 106 \approx 9.43\)

Now, we add these two results together:

LIX = 26.5 + 9.43 = 35.93

Finally, rounding the result, we obtain:

LIX = 36.

Thus, the final result is:

LIX=36.
