To calculate the LIX (Readability Index) for the provided text, let's break it down step-by-step according to the formula:

1. **Count the number of words**: 
   We read through the text and count each individual word. The text has a total of **64 words**.

2. **Count the number of sentences**: 
   We identify the sentences based on punctuation marks. The text has a total of **5 sentences**.

3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters**: 
   Next, we count how many words in the text have more than 6 letters. These words are: "motsättningar," "förebygga," "väldigt," "människor," "viktigt," "ändrar," "invandrare," "diskriminera," and "främlingsfientliga." Thus, there are **9 words** longer than 6 letters.

Now, we can plug these values into the LIX formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{\text{number of words}}{\text{number of sentences}} + \left(\frac{\text{number of words longer than 6 letters} \times 100}{\text{number of words}}\right) \]

Substituting the numbers we found:

1. Number of words = 64
2. Number of sentences = 5
3. Number of words longer than 6 letters = 9

Now plug these into the equation:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{64}{5} + \left( \frac{9 \times 100}{64} \right) \]

First, calculate \( \frac{64}{5} \):

\[ \frac{64}{5} = 12.8 \]

Next, calculate \( \frac{9 \times 100}{64} \):

\[ \frac{900}{64} \approx 14.0625 \]

Now, sum those two results:

\[ \text{LIX} \approx 12.8 + 14.0625 = 26.8625 \]

Rounding this value appropriately gives us:

**LIX = 26.9**

Thus, the final LIX readability score for the provided text is:

**LIX=26.9**
