To calculate the LIX readability score for the given Swedish text, we first need to gather some data:

1. **Number of Words**: We can count the individual components of the text.
2. **Number of Sentences**: We can identify sentences based on punctuation marks (like periods).
3. **Number of Words Longer than 6 Letters**: We will identify words in the text that have more than 6 letters.

Let's analyze the provided text step by step.

### Step 1: Count the Number of Words
Let's break down the provided text:
- The text includes mostly headings and numbers, with words interspersed throughout.
- I will count the number of words manually.

The words in the text include:
- "Sedan"
- "försökte"
- "jag"
- "sammanställa"
- "det"
- "till"
- "en"
- "relativt"
- "kort"
- "text"
- "Innehållsförteckning"
- And so on...

Total words counted: 49

### Step 2: Count the Number of Sentences
A sentence based on the provided text typically ends with a period or similar punctuation. In this case, there are likely two main sentences:
- "Sedan försökte jag sammanställa det till en relativt kort text."
- The following items are part of a list and can be considered as headings rather than complete sentences.

Total sentences counted: 1

### Step 3: Count the Number of Words Longer than 6 Letters
Next, let's identify words that have more than 6 letters:
- "sammanställa" (14)
- "Innehållsförteckning" (20)
- "Frågeställningar" (15)
- "Flygresor" (9)
- "Persondatorn" (12)
- "kommunicerar" (12)
- "historik" (8)
- "resultat" (8)

Total words longer than 6 letters counted: 8

### Step 4: Plug the Numbers into the LIX Formula
We have the following counts:
- Number of words = 49
- Number of sentences = 1
- Number of words longer than 6 letters = 8

Using the LIX formula:
\[
\text{LIX} = \frac{\text{number of words}}{\text{number of sentences}} + \left( \frac{\text{number of words longer than 6 letters}}{\text{number of words}} \times 100 \right)
\]

Now, substituting the values:
\[
\text{LIX} = \frac{49}{1} + \left( \frac{8}{49} \times 100 \right)
\]
\[
\text{LIX} = 49 + \left( 0.1633 \times 100 \right)
\]
\[
\text{LIX} = 49 + 16.33
\]
\[
\text{LIX} \approx 65.33
\]

### Final Result
Thus, rounding to two decimal places, the LIX score is:
LIX=65.33
