To calculate the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we will follow the formula step by step. 

First, let's analyze the text:

**Text:**
"This thesis is a continuation of the master thesis SPICA – ARISTO JÄMFÖRELSE by Jakob Katzman and Johan Fält. Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, May 2004. The task in this thesis is to seek alternative applied methods that can enhance the existing methodologies that are used by SPICA and ARISTO, to make the power system more efficient and reliable."

**Step 1: Count the number of words**
The total number of words in the text is 46.

**Step 2: Count the number of sentences**
The total number of sentences is 3.

**Step 3: Count the number of words longer than 6 letters**
The words longer than 6 letters in the text are:
- continuation (11 letters)
- methodologies (11 letters)
- efficiency (9 letters)
- reliable (8 letters)

The total count of words longer than 6 letters is 4.

**Step 4: Plug into the LIX formula**
Now, we can use the LIX formula:
\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{\text{Number of words}}{\text{Number of sentences}} + \frac{\text{Number of words longer than 6 letters} \times 100}{\text{Number of words}} \]

Now substituting in our counts:
- Number of words = 46
- Number of sentences = 3
- Number of words longer than 6 letters = 4

Substituting these into the formula:
\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{46}{3} + \frac{4 \times 100}{46} \]
\[ \text{LIX} = 15.33 + \frac{400}{46} \]
\[ \text{LIX} \approx 15.33 + 8.70 \]
\[ \text{LIX} \approx 24.03 \]

**Final Result:**
LIX = 24.03
