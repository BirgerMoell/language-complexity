To compute the LIX readability score of the provided text, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words** (total words in the text).
2. **Count the number of sentences**.
3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters**.

Now, let's analyze the text step by step.

### Given Text
"Since China is still considered a developing country, it is also still a lot different from Sweden, but it is changing rapidly. Most of the environmental laws that were studied are parts of the legal framework, which means that no exact limits or detailed guidelines are given. The company brings its cutting-edge technology, which still is new and unknown to the industrial park in China. Therefore it is too early to decide whether company F complies with the local jurisdiction in China."

### Step 1: Count the Number of Words
- The total number of words in the text = **108 words**.

### Step 2: Count the Number of Sentences
- The text contains 4 sentences:
  1. Since China is still considered a developing country, it is also still a lot different from Sweden, but it is changing rapidly.
  2. Most of the environmental laws that were studied are parts of the legal framework, which means that no exact limits or detailed guidelines are given.
  3. The company brings its cutting-edge technology, which still is new and unknown to the industrial park in China.
  4. Therefore, it is too early to decide whether company F complies with the local jurisdiction in China.

**Number of sentences = 4**

### Step 3: Count the Number of Words Longer Than 6 Letters
- Words longer than 6 letters in the text: 
  - considered (9)
  - different (9)
  - changing (8)
  - environmental (13)
  - studied (7)
  - framework (9)
  - detailed (8)
  - guidelines (9)
  - cutting-edge (11)
  - technology (10)
  - unknown (7)
  - jurisdiction (11)

Total number of words longer than 6 letters = **12**.

### LIX Calculation
Now we can use the LIX formula:

\[
LIX = \frac{(number\ of\ words)}{(number\ of\ sentences)} + \frac{(number\ of\ words\ longer\ than\ 6\ letters) \times 100}{(number\ of\ words)}
\]

Substituting the values we have:
- Number of words = 108
- Number of sentences = 4
- Number of words longer than 6 letters = 12

\[
LIX = \frac{108}{4} + \frac{12 \times 100}{108}
\]
\[
LIX = 27 + \frac{1200}{108}
\]
Calculating the second part:
\[
\frac{1200}{108} \approx 11.11
\]

Now combine the results:
\[
LIX = 27 + 11.11 \approx 38.11
\]

Finally, we round to two decimal points.

### Result
Thus, the LIX readability score of the provided text is:
LIX=38.11
