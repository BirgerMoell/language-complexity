To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we first need to analyze the text.

### Step 1: Breakdown the text
The text provided is:

"Most of today's building damages can be linked to moisture. Moisture also plays a significant role in health problems related to indoor climate. Building physics is despite this rarely discussed seriously during the building design phase. Possible reasons include unclear responsibilities; short-term economic focus; a fragmentized building process; and lack of proper training and competence."

### Step 2: Count the components
1. **Number of words**: We will count the total number of words in the text.
2. **Number of sentences**: We will count how many sentences are in the text.
3. **Number of words longer than 6 letters**: We will identify and count how many words have more than 6 letters.

Let's count them:

- **Number of words**: 
  - The text has a total of **63 words**.

- **Number of sentences**:
  - The text consists of **4 sentences**.

- **Number of words longer than 6 letters**:
  - In the text, the following words have more than 6 letters: 
    - "building" (8 letters)
    - "damages" (7 letters)
    - "difficult" (8 letters)
    - "significant" (11 letters)
    - "problems" (8 letters)
    - "indoor" (7 letters)
    - "discussed" (9 letters)
    - "responsibilities" (15 letters)
    - "short-term" (10 letters)
    - "economic" (8 letters)
    - "fragmentized" (12 letters)
    - "training" (8 letters)
    - "competence" (10 letters)
- Total number of words longer than 6 letters: **13 words**

### Step 3: LIX Calculation
Now we can plug these numbers into the formula for the LIX score:

\[
LIX = \left(\frac{\text{Number of words}}{\text{Number of sentences}} + \frac{\text{Number of words longer than 6 letters} \times 100}{\text{Number of words}}\right)
\]

Substituting in our values:

- Number of words = 63
- Number of sentences = 4
- Number of words longer than 6 letters = 13

Calculating the components:

1. Number of words per sentence:
   \[
   \frac{63}{4} = 15.75
   \]

2. Number of words longer than 6 letters per 100 words:
   \[
   \frac{13 \times 100}{63} \approx 20.63
   \]

Now combine these results:

\[
LIX = 15.75 + 20.63 = 36.38
\]

### Result
The LIX readability score for the provided text is:
LIX=36.38
