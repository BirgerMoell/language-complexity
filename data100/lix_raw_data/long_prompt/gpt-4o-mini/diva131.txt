To compute the LIX readability score for the given Swedish text, we need to perform the following calculations based on the LIX formula:

1. **Count the number of words.**
2. **Count the number of sentences.**
3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters.**

**Step 1: Count the Number of Words**
The text is as follows:

"The industry had three different production divisions and only one of these was studied, the so-called “Blå linan”. During the study, the production on the “Blå linan” consisted of solid concrete beams and solid concrete walls. To identify the “bottlenecks” in the production, a time study was made where the cycle time was analysed. Furthermore, a work sampling was carried out and the content of work in the workstations which were earlier identified as bottlenecks were observed."

There are 89 words in this text.

**Step 2: Count the Number of Sentences**
The sentences in the text are as follows (identified by periods):
1. "The industry had three different production divisions and only one of these was studied, the so-called “Blå linan”. 
2. "During the study, the production on the “Blå linan” consisted of solid concrete beams and solid concrete walls."
3. "To identify the “bottlenecks” in the production, a time study was made where the cycle time was analysed."
4. "Furthermore, a work sampling was carried out and the content of work in the workstations which were earlier identified as bottlenecks were observed."

There are 4 sentences in this text.

**Step 3: Count the Number of Words Longer than 6 Letters**
Now we count words longer than 6 letters:
- "industry" (8)
- "different" (9)
- "production" (10)
- "divisions" (8)
- "studied" (7)
- "so-called" (8)
- "consisted" (9)
- "bottlenecks" (11)
- "analysed" (8)
- "sampling" (8)
- "workstations" (12)
- "identified" (9)
- "bottlenecks" (11)

There are 13 words longer than 6 letters.

**Step 4: Substitute the Values in the LIX Formula**
Now we plug the counts into the LIX formula:

LIX = (number of words) / (number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (number of words)

LIX = (89 words) / (4 sentences) + (13 words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (89 words)
LIX = 22.25 + 14.61
LIX = 36.86

**Final Result**
LIX = 36.86

Now, writing the result as requested:

LIX=36.86
