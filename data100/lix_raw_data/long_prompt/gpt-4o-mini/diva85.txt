To calculate the LIX readability score for the given Swedish text, we need to follow the steps outlined in the LIX formula:

LIX = (number of words) / (number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (number of words)

### Step 1: Count the number of words
Let’s identify the number of words in the provided text. 

The text is:
"Especially, I want to thank My academic supervisor Martin Törngren who, despite a heavy workload, have contributed with a lot of valuable feedback and help with this thesis. My supervisors at Regin: Anders Ågren who have been supporting and supplying me with the adequate software tools to be able to debug the implementation. Lars Matsson for helping me with code optimization and the temporary fixes to produce a lean Regio firmware."

Total Words: 82

### Step 2: Count the number of sentences
Identifying the number of sentences in the text. Each sentence typically ends with a period.

Sentences:
1. Especially, I want to thank My academic supervisor Martin Törngren who, despite a heavy workload, have contributed with a lot of valuable feedback and help with this thesis.
2. My supervisors at Regin: Anders Ågren who have been supporting and supplying me with the adequate software tools to be able to debug the implementation.
3. Lars Matsson for helping me with code optimization and the temporary fixes to produce a lean Regio firmware.

Total Sentences: 3

### Step 3: Count the number of words longer than 6 letters
Now, we need to count how many words are longer than 6 letters:

- supervisor (10)
- Törngren (8)
- despite (8)
- workload (8)
- contributed (12)
- valuable (8)
- feedback (8)
- supervisors (10)
- supporting (10)
- supplying (9)
- adequate (8)
- software (8)
- optimize (8)
- optimization (11)
- temporary (9)
- produce (7)
- firmware (7)

Total Words Longer than 6 letters: 16

### Step 4: Calculate LIX score
Now we can use the values we've gathered to calculate the LIX score.

- Number of words = 82
- Number of sentences = 3
- Number of words longer than 6 letters = 16

Using the formula:

LIX = (82 / 3) + (16 * 100 / 82)

LIX = (27.33) + (19.51)

LIX = 46.84 (rounded to two decimal places)

Final result:

LIX = 46.84
