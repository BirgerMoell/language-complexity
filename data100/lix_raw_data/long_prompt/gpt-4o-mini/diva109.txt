To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we first need to gather the required components: the number of words, the number of sentences, and the number of words longer than 6 letters.

Let's analyze the text step by step:

1. **Count the number of words**: 
   The text contains the following words (counting each individually):
   - It
   - emanates
   - from
   - an
   - EC
   - directive
   - in
   - 2002.
   - The
   - purpose
   - of
   - energy
   - certification
   - of
   - buildings
   - is
   - efficiency
   - in
   - the
   - use
   - of
   - energy
   - and
   - a
   - reduction
   - of
   - emissions
   - effecting
   - climate.
   - Buildings
   - account
   - for
   - about
   - 40%
   - of
   - the
   - total
   - use
   - of
   - energy
   - in
   - EU
   - countries.
   - Rising
   - costs
   - of
   - energy,
   - combined
   - with
   - an
   - increasing
   - environmental
   - consciousness
   - on
   - the
   - part
   - of
   - building
   - owners,
   - render
   - timely
   - the
   - law
   - on
   - certification
   - of
   - buildings
   - for
   - energy
   - efficiency.

   Total words = 82.

2. **Count the number of sentences**: 
   The text appears to have 3 sentences:
   - "It emanates from an EC directive in 2002."
   - "The purpose of energy certification of buildings is efficiency in the use of energy and a reduction of emissions effecting climate."
   - "Buildings account for about 40% of the total use of energy in EU countries."
   - "Rising costs of energy, combined with an increasing environmental consciousness on the part of building owners, render timely the law on certification of buildings for energy efficiency."

   Total sentences = 4.

3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters**:
   The following words in the text are longer than 6 letters:
   - emanates (8)
   - directive (8)
   - certification (11)
   - buildings (8)
   - efficiency (9)
   - reduction (8)
   - emissions (8)
   - effecting (8)
   - consciousness (13)
   - increasing (9)

   Total words longer than 6 letters = 10.

Now we can plug these numbers into the LIX formula:

\[
LIX = \frac{( \text{number of words} )}{( \text{number of sentences} )} + \frac{( \text{number of words longer than 6 letters} ) \times 100}{( \text{number of words} )}
\]

Substituting in the values we obtained:

\[
LIX = \frac{82}{4} + \frac{10 \times 100}{82}
\]

Calculating each part:

1. \(\frac{82}{4} = 20.5\)
2. \(\frac{10 \times 100}{82} = \frac{1000}{82} \approx 12.2\)

Adding these together:

\[
LIX \approx 20.5 + 12.2 = 32.7
\]

Thus, rounding to the nearest whole number (if necessary), the final LIX readability score is:

**LIX=33**
