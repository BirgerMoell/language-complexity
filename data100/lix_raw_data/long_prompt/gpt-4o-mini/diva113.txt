To compute the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, let's first clarify the necessary components:

1. **Count the number of words**.
2. **Count the number of sentences**.
3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters**.

Now let's analyze the text:

```
If the actual energy consumption is significantly below the reference value, we believe that a major, costly investigation is not necessary. 
· Identification of systems and processes, this makes it necessary to examine the type of heating system, for comfort cooling, etc. 
· Visual inspection / investigation of the building with examination of the status of different parts of the buildings service systems. 
Check of operating times and set values.
```

**Step 1: Count the number of words.**
- Total words: 53

**Step 2: Count the number of sentences.**
- Sentence 1: "If the actual energy consumption is significantly below the reference value, we believe that a major, costly investigation is not necessary." (1 sentence)
- Sentence 2: "Identification of systems and processes, this makes it necessary to examine the type of heating system, for comfort cooling, etc." (1 sentence)
- Sentence 3: "Visual inspection / investigation of the building with examination of the status of different parts of the buildings service systems." (1 sentence)
- Sentence 4: "Check of operating times and set values." (1 sentence)

- Total sentences: 4

**Step 3: Count the number of words longer than 6 letters.**
- "significantly" (14 letters)
- "investigation" (11 letters)
- "necessary" (9 letters)
- "Identification" (13 letters)
- "processes" (8 letters)
- "examine" (7 letters)
- "inspection" (10 letters)
- "examination" (11 letters)
- "different" (9 letters)
- "buildings" (8 letters)
- "operating" (8 letters)
- Total words longer than 6 letters: 11

**LIX Calculation:**
Now we can compute the LIX score using the formula provided:

LIX = (number of words / number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters * 100 / number of words)

Substituting the numbers we've gathered into the formula:

- Number of words = 53
- Number of sentences = 4 
- Number of words longer than 6 letters = 11

LIX = (53 / 4) + (11 * 100 / 53)

Calculating:

1. Number of words / number of sentences = 53 / 4 = 13.25
2. Number of words longer than 6 letters * 100 / number of words = (11 * 100) / 53 ≈ 20.75

Now add those together:

LIX = 13.25 + 20.75 = 34.00

Thus, the final LIX score for the provided text is:

LIX=34.00
