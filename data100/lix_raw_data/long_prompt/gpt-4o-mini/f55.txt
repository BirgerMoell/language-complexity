To calculate the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, let's first analyze the text and extract the necessary components as per the LIX formula:

1. **Count the number of words**: The text contains 98 words in total.
2. **Count the number of sentences**: The text consists of 5 sentences.
3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters**:
   - "antivirus" (8)
   - "program" (7)
   - "fönster" (7)
   - "tipsar" (6)
   - "snällt" (6)
   - "spyware" (7)
   - "virusar" (6)
   - "utanför" (8)
   - "otroligt" (8)
   - "jobbig" (6)
   - "pop-upfönstren" (13)

   From the analysis, the words longer than 6 letters are: "antivirus", "program", "fönster", "snällt", "spyware", "otroligt", and "pop-upfönstren". This totals to 7 words.

Now we can plug the numbers into the LIX formula:
\[ 
\text{LIX} = \left( \frac{\text{number of words}}{\text{number of sentences}} \right) + \left( \frac{\text{number of words longer than 6 letters} \times 100}{\text{number of words}} \right) 
\]

Substituting in our counts:
- Number of words: 98
- Number of sentences: 5
- Number of words longer than 6 letters: 7

Now we do the calculations:
1. Calculate the first term: 
\[
\frac{98}{5} = 19.6
\]
2. Calculate the second term:
\[
\frac{7 \times 100}{98} \approx 7.14
\]
3. Add both terms together:
\[
LIX = 19.6 + 7.14 \approx 26.74
\]

Now rounding off, we can express the final result as:
LIX=27
