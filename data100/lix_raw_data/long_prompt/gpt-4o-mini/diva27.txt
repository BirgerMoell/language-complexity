To calculate the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, I will follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words**: 
   Let's count the total number of words in the text. The provided text is:
   "An IPM from International Rectifier has been modified and tested by letting the IPM drive a permanent magnet motor under typical load conditions for a long time. The test showed that an IPM is a good alternative for the future, when it comes to the matter of efficiency, cost and space."

   Total number of words = 46

2. **Count the number of sentences**:
   A sentence is typically defined as a group of words ending with a period, exclamation mark, or question mark. In the given text, there are 2 sentences.

3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters**:
   Now, we'll identify words longer than 6 letters in the text:
   - "modified" (8)
   - "International" (13)
   - "permanent" (9)
   - "conditions" (10)
   - "alternative" (9)
   - "efficiency" (11)

   Total number of words longer than 6 letters = 6

Now we have the counts:
- Total words = 46
- Total sentences = 2
- Words longer than 6 letters = 6

4. **Calculate the LIX score**:
   We can now plug the values into the LIX formula:

   LIX = (number of words / number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters * 100 / number of words)

   Substituting in our counts:
   LIX = (46 / 2) + (6 * 100 / 46)

   First calculating each part:
   - (46 / 2) = 23
   - (6 * 100 / 46) = 600 / 46 ≈ 13.04347826

   Now, adding these results together:
   LIX ≈ 23 + 13.04 ≈ 36.04

Finally, we round the LIX score as necessary. 

Thus, the final readability score is:
LIX=36.04
