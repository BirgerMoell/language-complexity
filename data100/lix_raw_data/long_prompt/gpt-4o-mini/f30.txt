To calculate the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, let's follow the steps outlined in the formula: 

1. **Count the number of words**: The text has a total of 53 words.

2. **Count the number of sentences**: There are 4 sentences in this text.

3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters**: The following words are longer than 6 letters:
   - florentinare (12)
   - ankomst (8)
   - dominera (8)
   - musiklivet (9)
   - utvecklade (9)
   - modellera (9)
   - språkmelodin (12)
   - noggrann (8)
   - intonation (10)
   - orkestrering (13)
   - bravurform (9)
   - femstämmig (9)
   - omväxlande (10)
   - fugativo (8)
   - uvertyr (7)

   This gives a total of 15 words longer than 6 letters.

Now we can plug these values into the LIX formula:

LIX = (number of words) / (number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (number of words)

Calculating it step-by-step:

- Number of words (W) = 53
- Number of sentences (S) = 4
- Number of words longer than 6 letters (L) = 15

1. Calculate W / S: 
   \( \frac{53}{4} = 13.25 \)

2. Calculate (L * 100) / W:
   \( \frac{15 \times 100}{53} \approx 28.30 \)

3. Now add the two results:
   LIX = 13.25 + 28.30 = 41.55

Finally, we round the result for readability scores, and we present it as:

LIX = 42
