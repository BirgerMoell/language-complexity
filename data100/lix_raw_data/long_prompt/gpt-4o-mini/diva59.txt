To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we need to follow the formula you provided:

**LIX = (number of words) / (number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (number of words)**

Let's analyze the text step-by-step:

**Text:** "We enjoyed exposure to numerous articulate people within the company. Special acknowledgements are directed towards Cecilia, Jan, Joakim, Niklas and Susanne for their great support when comprehending the particular problem we solved together."

1. **Count the number of words:**
   The text consists of 31 words.

2. **Count the number of sentences:**
   There are 2 sentences in the text. (Each sentence ends with a period.)

3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters:**
   - articulate (9 letters)
   - acknowledgements (15 letters)
   - directed (8 letters)
   - towards (8 letters)
   - comprehending (13 letters)
   - particular (9 letters)
   - together (8 letters)

   Total words longer than 6 letters = 7.

Now we can substitute these values into the LIX formula:

- Number of words = 31
- Number of sentences = 2
- Number of words longer than 6 letters = 7

Now, calculating:
1. Calculate words / sentences: 
   \( \frac{31}{2} = 15.5 \)

2. Calculate (words longer than 6 letters * 100) / number of words: 
   \( \frac{7 \times 100}{31} \approx 22.58 \) (approximately)

3. Add the two results together:
   \( LIX = 15.5 + 22.58 \approx 38.08 \)

Finally, rounding to two decimal places, the result is:

**LIX = 38.08**
