To calculate the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we will follow the formula: 

\[ \text{LIX} = \left( \frac{\text{number of words}}{\text{number of sentences}} \right) + \left( \frac{\text{number of words longer than 6 letters} \times 100}{\text{number of words}} \right) \]

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Count the number of words**: 
   The text contains a total of **90 words**.

2. **Count the number of sentences**: 
   There are **5 sentences** in the text. The sentences can be identified by the period (.) that ends each one.

3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters**: 
   We need to analyze each word for its length:
   - Words longer than 6 letters in the text:
     - Angripa (7 letters)
     - Enligt (7 letters)
     - Hemliga (7 letters)
     - Tilläggsavtalet (14 letters)
     - Offentligt (10 letters)
     - Baltiska (8 letters)
     - Skapats (7 letters)
     - Gått (7 letters)
     - Molontovribbentovpakten (22 letters)
     - Exporterade (12 letters)
     - Järnmalm (8 letters)
     - Krigsindustri (12 letters)

   Upon counting, there are **12 words** longer than 6 letters.

Now we can plug these numbers into the LIX formula:

- Number of words = 90
- Number of sentences = 5
- Number of words longer than 6 letters = 12

Now substituting the values into the LIX formula:

1. Calculate \( \frac{\text{number of words}}{\text{number of sentences}} \):
   \[
   \frac{90}{5} = 18
   \]

2. Calculate \( \frac{\text{number of words longer than 6 letters} \times 100}{\text{number of words}} \):
   \[
   \frac{12 \times 100}{90} = \frac{1200}{90} = 13.33
   \]

3. Combine these two results to get the final LIX score:
   \[
   LIX = 18 + 13.33 = 31.33
   \]

Rounding the final score, we can write:

LIX=31.33
