To calculate the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we need to follow the formula: 

**LIX = (number of words) / (number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (number of words)**

Let's break down the text step by step:

### Step 1: Count the total number of words
The text is:
"Men jag tog bara jätte lite information från Wikipedia eftersom jag redan hade tillräckligt med information från mina andra källor."

Counting the words yields a total of **23 words**.

### Step 2: Count the number of sentences
There is only **1 sentence** in the text since it is a single continuous statement.

### Step 3: Identify words longer than 6 letters
Now, we need to find words that are longer than 6 letters:
- information (11 letters)
- Wikipedia (9 letters)
- eftersom (8 letters)
- tillräckligt (12 letters)

Counting these, we find **4 words** that are longer than 6 letters.

### Step 4: Insert numbers into the LIX formula
Now we can plug these values into the LIX formula:

1. **Number of words** = 23
2. **Number of sentences** = 1
3. **Number of words longer than 6 letters** = 4

Inserting these values into the formula gives us:

\[
LIX = \frac{23}{1} + \frac{4 \times 100}{23}
\]

Calculating step by step:
- First part: \( \frac{23}{1} = 23 \)
- Second part: \( \frac{4 \times 100}{23} = \frac{400}{23} \approx 17.39 \)

### Step 5: Add both parts together
Now, we add the two parts of the equation:

\[
LIX \approx 23 + 17.39 \approx 40.39
\]

### Final Result
Since LIX is usually presented as a whole number, we round this value to the nearest whole number.

Thus, the final LIX score is:

**LIX = 40**.
