To calculate the LIX (Literary Index) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we will follow the formula you mentioned.

1. **Count the number of words (W)**:
   The text contains 118 words.

2. **Count the number of sentences (S)**:
   There is a single sentence in the text.

3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters (L)**:
   We will identify the words longer than 6 letters. The following words fit this criterion: 
   - "tillgång" (8 letters)
   - "programmet" (9 letters)
   - "hjälp" (5 letters) - not counted
   - "support" (7 letters)
   - "Byggnadsteknik" (15 letters)

   So, we have:
   - tillgång
   - programmet
   - support
   - Byggnadsteknik

   This gives us a total of 4 words longer than 6 letters.

4. **Now we apply the formula**:
   The LIX scoring formula is:
   \[
   LIX = \frac{W}{S} + \frac{L \times 100}{W}
   \]
   Plugging in our values:
   - W = 118
   - S = 1
   - L = 4

   Now let's compute:
   \[
   LIX = \frac{118}{1} + \frac{4 \times 100}{118}
   \]
   \[
   LIX = 118 + \frac{400}{118}
   \]
   \[
   LIX \approx 118 + 3.3898 \approx 121.3898
   \]

5. **Final rounding**:
   We can round LIX to the nearest integer, which gives us approximately 121.

Thus, the final LIX score for the text is:

**LIX = 121**
