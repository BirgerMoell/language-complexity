To compute the LIX readability score for the given Swedish text, we can follow the formula provided:

**LIX = (number of words / number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters * 100 / number of words)**

Let's first determine the components needed for the calculation:

1. **Count the number of words:**
   The words can be counted manually or using a word counter tool. In this case, I will count them manually:
   
   The text contains 85 words total.

2. **Count the number of sentences:**
   Sentences are generally defined by their endings such as periods and question marks. 
   The given text contains 6 sentences.

3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters:**
   Here, I'll count words longer than 6 letters:
   - HÃ¥rdvara (8)
   - Utrustningen (12)
   - CD-ROM (7)
   - Compact (7)
   - Information (11)
   - Hemsidor (8)
   - Datorer (7)

   Total = 7 words longer than 6 letters.

Now that we have all the necessary counts, we can substitute these values into the LIX formula:

- Number of words = 85
- Number of sentences = 6
- Number of words longer than 6 letters = 7

Using the LIX formula:

1. Calculate the first part: 
   - (number of words / number of sentences) = 85 / 6 = approximately 14.17

2. Calculate the second part: 
   - (number of words longer than 6 letters * 100 / number of words) = (7 * 100) / 85 = 8.24

3. Finally, combine the two parts:
   - LIX = 14.17 + 8.24 = 22.41

Therefore, the computed LIX readability score for the text is:

**LIX=22.41**
