To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we will follow the given formula:

LIX = (number of words) / (number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (number of words)

Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Count the number of words**: 
   The text contains a total of **89 words**.

2. **Count the number of sentences**: 
   The text is composed of **5 sentences**.

3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters**: 
   The words longer than 6 letters in the text are:
   - advantages (9)
   - efficient (9)
   - manufacturing (11)
   - material (7)
   - efficiency (9)
   - challenges (9)
   - traditional (10)
   - methods (7)
   - larger (6)

   There are 8 words longer than 6 letters.

Now we can plug these counts into the LIX formula:

- Total number of words = 89
- Total number of sentences = 5
- Number of words longer than 6 letters = 8

Now we calculate both parts of the LIX formula:

1. **(number of words) / (number of sentences)** = 89 / 5 = 17.8
2. **(number of words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (number of words)** = (8 * 100) / 89 = 8.99

Now we combine both parts to get the LIX score:

LIX = 17.8 + 8.99 = 26.79

So, rounding to two decimal places, we get:

LIX = 26.79

The final result is: 

LIX=26.79
