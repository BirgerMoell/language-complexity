To calculate the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) score for the given Swedish text, we will follow the formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{\text{(number of words)}}{\text{(number of sentences)}} + \frac{(\text{number of words longer than 6 letters}) \times 100}{\text{(number of words)}} \]

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. **Count the total number of words**: 
   - The provided text contains 91 words.

2. **Count the total number of sentences**: 
   - The text consists of 3 sentences.

3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters**: 
   - The words longer than 6 letters are: "Uppgraderingsmöjligheter" (19 letters), "moderkortet" (12 letters), "processor" (8 letters), "exempelvis" (11 letters), "tilläggskort" (12 letters), "scanners" (8 letters) and "kräver" (7 letters).
   - This gives us a total of **7 words longer than 6 letters**.

Now, we can plug these values into the LIX formula:

1. Calculate the first part: 
   \[
   \frac{\text{(number of words)}}{\text{(number of sentences)}} = \frac{91}{3} \approx 30.33
   \]

2. Calculate the second part: 
   \[
   \frac{(\text{number of words longer than 6 letters}) \times 100}{\text{(number of words)}} = \frac{7 \times 100}{91} \approx 7.69
   \]

3. Add the results from step 1 and step 2: 
   \[
   \text{LIX} = 30.33 + 7.69 \approx 38.02
   \]

Now we can round this to obtain the final LIX score.

Finally, we express the result as follows:

LIX = 38.02
