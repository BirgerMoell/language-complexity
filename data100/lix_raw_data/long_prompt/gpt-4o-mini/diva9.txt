To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we'll first need to gather the necessary components: the total number of words, the total number of sentences, and the number of words longer than 6 letters.

### Step 1: Analyze the Text

**Text:**
"The empirical investigation is primarily based upon qualitative interviews with public officials in seven Swedish municipalities. The study concludes in that ‘a sense of place’ as defined within the study, is highly relevant and present in Swedish municipal planning practice."

- **Sentences:** 
  - The text consists of 2 sentences. 
    1. "The empirical investigation is primarily based upon qualitative interviews with public officials in seven Swedish municipalities."
    2. "The study concludes in that ‘a sense of place’ as defined within the study, is highly relevant and present in Swedish municipal planning practice."

- **Words Count:** 
  - Let's count the total number of words. The total count is 39 words.

- **Words Longer Than 6 Letters:**
  - We'll identify words that are longer than 6 letters:
    - empirical (8)
    - investigation (11)
    - primarily (9)
    - qualitative (10)
    - municipalities (13)
    - concludes (9)
    - relevance (9)
    - present (7)
    - municipal (8)
    - planning (8)
    
  The longer words list: empirical, investigation, primarily, qualitative, municipalities, concludes, relevant, present, municipal, planning.
  
  **Count = 10 words longer than 6 letters.**

### Step 2: Compute LIX Score

Now, we will apply the LIX formula:

LIX = (number of words / number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters * 100 / number of words)

Now let's plug in the numbers we counted:
- Number of words = 39
- Number of sentences = 2
- Number of words longer than 6 letters = 10

Calculations:
1. Number of words / Number of sentences:
   \[
   \frac{39}{2} = 19.5
   \]

2. Number of words longer than 6 letters * 100 / Number of words:
   \[
   \frac{10 \times 100}{39} \approx 25.64
   \]

3. Combine both results to get the LIX score:
   \[
   LIX = 19.5 + 25.64 = 45.14
   \]

### Final Result

Thus, the final LIX readability score for the given text is:

LIX = 45.14
