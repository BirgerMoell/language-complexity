To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we will follow the formula:

LIX = (number of words) / (number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (number of words)

Now, let's break down the text and perform the necessary counts:

1. **Count the number of words in the text.**
   - The text has 116 words.
  
2. **Count the number of sentences in the text.**
   - The text consists of 5 sentences.

3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters.**
   - The words longer than 6 letters in the text are: 
     - "ekvatorn" (8 letters)
     - "bildades" (8 letters)
     - "glaciärer" (9 letters)
     - "rullstensåsar" (13 letters)
     - "fördelat" (8 letters)
     - "tropiska" (8 letters)
     - "subtropiska" (11 letters)
     - "varierat" (8 letters)
     - "månad" (6 letters, does not count)
     - "subtropiska" (11 letters)
   
   Thus, the total number of words longer than 6 letters is 9.

Now, we can plug the numbers into the LIX formula:

- Number of words = 116
- Number of sentences = 5
- Number of words longer than 6 letters = 9

Now we can compute the LIX score:

1. Calculate \( \frac{116}{5} = 23.2 \)
2. Calculate \( \frac{9 \times 100}{116} \approx 7.76 \)
3. Add the two results together: \( 23.2 + 7.76 = 30.96 \)

Rounding the score to two decimal places:

LIX = 30.96

Finally, write the result as requested:

LIX=30.96
