To calculate the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, I will follow the formula you provided. Let's break down the components needed for the calculation step-by-step:

1. **Count the number of words**: 
   - The text provided contains **84 words**.

2. **Count the number of sentences**:
   - There are **2 sentences** in the text.

3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters**:
   - The words longer than 6 letters are: 
     - lyftanordning (14 letters)
     - frihetsgrader (13 letters)
     - anpassad (8 letters)
     - utvecklades (12 letters)
     - testades (8 letters)
     - utvecklade (10 letters)
     - respektive (10 letters)
     - batterienhet (12 letters)
     - batterivagnen (12 letters)
     - manuellt (8 letters)
     - telekomstationens (18 letters) 
   - In total, there are **11 words** longer than 6 letters.

Now we have:
- Number of words = 84
- Number of sentences = 2
- Number of words longer than 6 letters = 11

Now, we substitute these values into the LIX formula:

LIX = (number of words) / (number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (number of words)

Plugging in the numbers:
LIX = (84) / (2) + (11) * 100 / (84)

Let's calculate it:

1. Number of words per sentence:
   - 84 / 2 = 42

2. Percentage of words longer than 6 letters:
   - (11 * 100) / 84 = 13.0952381 (approximately 13.1 when rounded)

Now combine both parts:
LIX = 42 + 13.1 = 55.1

Finally, we can format the result as requested:

LIX=55.1
