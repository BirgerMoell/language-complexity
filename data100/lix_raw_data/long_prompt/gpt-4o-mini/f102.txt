To compute the LIX readability score, we need to follow the formula provided:

\[ \text{LIX} = \left( \frac{\text{number of words}}{\text{number of sentences}} \right) + \left( \frac{\text{number of words longer than 6 letters} \times 100}{\text{number of words}} \right) \]

**Step 1: Counting the elements in the text**

1. **Count the number of words:**
   We will split the text into words.
   - Total words: 61

2. **Count the number of sentences:**
   Identify the number of complete sentences in the text. Each period (.), question mark (?), or exclamation mark (!) typically indicates a sentence.
   - Total sentences: 3

3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters:**
   We look for words that are longer than 6 letters.
   - The words longer than 6 letters are: 
     - "nyckel" (6) - not counted
     - "sänder" (6) - not counted
     - "mottagaren" (10)
     - "hemliga" (7)
     - "krypteringsprogrammet" (20) - not counted (spelling error fixed to "programmet," which is 9)
     - "populäraste" (11)
     - "algoritmer" (10)
     - "information" (11), "säkerhet" (8)
   - Total words longer than 6 letters: 7

**Step 2: Applying the LIX formula**

Now we can plug our counts into the LIX formula:

Number of words = 61  
Number of sentences = 3  
Number of words longer than 6 letters = 7  

\[
LIX = \left( \frac{61}{3} \right) + \left( \frac{7 \times 100}{61} \right)
\]

Calculating each part:

1. \(\frac{61}{3} \approx 20.33\)
2. \(\frac{7 \times 100}{61} \approx \frac{700}{61} \approx 11.48\)

Adding these together:

\[
LIX \approx 20.33 + 11.48 \approx 31.81
\]

**Final Result:**

LIX = 31.81
