To calculate the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we'll follow the formula given:

LIX = (number of words) / (number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (number of words)

Let's break down each component of the calculation based on the provided text.

1. **Counting the words**:
   - Total words in the text: 84

2. **Counting the sentences**:
   - Total sentences in the text: 4 (There are breaks suggesting multiple thoughts, which can be seen at the '.', but I will count based on the typical structure.)

3. **Counting the words longer than 6 letters**:
   - Words longer than 6 letters include: "motsvarade" (10), "ägnar" (7), "internet" (8), "användare" (9), "communitys" (9), "registrerar" (11), "lagrar" (7), "uppgifterna" (11), "aktuell" (8), "hämtas" (7), "databasen" (8) 
   - Total words longer than 6 letters: 11

Now, we can substitute these values into the LIX formula:

Let's calculate step by step:

- Number of words (W) = 84
- Number of sentences (S) = 4
- Number of words longer than 6 letters (L) = 11

First, compute the first part (W/S):
\[ \frac{W}{S} = \frac{84}{4} = 21 \]

Next, compute the second part (L*100/W):
\[ \frac{L \times 100}{W} = \frac{11 \times 100}{84} \approx 13.10 \]

Now, we add the two parts to calculate the LIX score:
\[ LIX = 21 + 13.10 \approx 34.10 \]

Therefore, rounding to a whole number, we get:

LIX = 34.
