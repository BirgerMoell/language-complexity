To calculate the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we'll first need to follow the LIX formula:

\[ 
\text{LIX} = \frac{\text{number of words}}{\text{number of sentences}} + \left(\frac{\text{number of words longer than 6 letters} \times 100}{\text{number of words}}\right)
\]

### Step 1: Count the number of words
Let's go through the text and count the number of words:

> "An academic benchmark case (Unsteady Aerodynamics Experiment Phase III) was selected as a starting point of the optimization because wind tunnel data was available for that campain. With the geometry developed by the genetic algoritm a theoretical increase of 15 % more power could be extracted. However, it has been shown that the model has shortcomings at high wind speeds where the predicted power does not match wind tunnel data."

1. The first sentence has 26 words.
2. The second sentence has 33 words.
3. The third sentence has 24 words.

Total number of words = 26 + 33 + 24 = **83 words**.

### Step 2: Count the number of sentences
We can see that there are three sentences in the text. 

Total number of sentences = **3**.

### Step 3: Count the number of words longer than 6 letters
Now, we will identify the words that are longer than 6 letters:

- academic (7)
- benchmark (9)
- Unsteady (8)
- Experiment (10)
- optimization (11)
- available (8)
- campaign (8)
- geometry (7)
- developed (8)
- genetic (7)
- theoretical (11)
- increase (8)
- extracted (9)
- shown (6)
- shortcomings (11)
- predicted (9)

Total number of words longer than 6 letters = **15**.

### Step 4: Substitute the values into the LIX formula
Now we can substitute these values into the LIX formula.

1. Number of words = 83
2. Number of sentences = 3
3. Number of words longer than 6 letters = 15

Calculating the first part: 
\[
\frac{83}{3} = 27.67
\]

Calculating the second part: 
\[
\frac{15 \times 100}{83} \approx 18.07
\]

### Step 5: Add the two results
\[
\text{LIX} \approx 27.67 + 18.07 = 45.74
\]

### Final Result
We can round the result to two decimal places for simplicity:

LIX = 45.74
