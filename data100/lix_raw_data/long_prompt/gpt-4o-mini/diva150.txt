To calculate the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we will need to follow the formula as stated: 

LIX = (number of words / number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters * 100 / number of words)

Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Count the number of words**: 
   The provided text contains 98 words.

2. **Count the number of sentences**: 
   The text consists of 5 sentences.

3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters**: 
   - Extensive (8)
   - Literature (9)
   - Evaluate (7)
   - Characterize (12)
   - Performance (10)
   - Material (7)
   - Advantages (9)
   - Disadvantages (11)
   - Techniques (9)
   - Separated (9)
   - Techniques (9)
   - Production (8)
   - Articles (8)

   Thus, the total number of words longer than 6 letters is 13.

Now, we can plug these numbers into the LIX formula:

\[
\text{LIX} = \left( \frac{98}{5} \right) + \left( \frac{13 \times 100}{98} \right)
\]

Calculating each part:

1. \( \frac{98}{5} = 19.6 \)
2. \( \frac{13 \times 100}{98} = \frac{1300}{98} \approx 13.27 \)

Now, adding these two results together:

\[
\text{LIX} = 19.6 + 13.27 \approx 32.87
\]

Rounding it to two decimal places, we get:

LIX = 32.87
