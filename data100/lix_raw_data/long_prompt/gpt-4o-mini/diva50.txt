To calculate the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we will follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words** in the text.
2. **Count the number of sentences** in the text.
3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters** in the text.
4. **Apply the LIX formula** to compute the score.

Let's analyze the text step by step:

### Step 1: Count the Number of Words

The provided text is:
"The process for purchase is considered by many to be a key factor in businesses work towards sustainable development. Key people in this process and target audience for this education is environmental, purchasing and procurement managers. The purpose of this study is to design an education called Miljösäkrade inköp from the target audiences’ knowledge, interests and attitudes, together with literature."

- Total words = 52

### Step 2: Count the Number of Sentences

Sentences are typically defined by punctuation (usually periods, exclamation marks, or question marks). In the provided text, we see:
1. The first sentence ends with a period after "development."
2. The second sentence ends with a period after "managers."
3. The third sentence ends with a period after "literature."

- Total sentences = 3

### Step 3: Count the Number of Words Longer Than 6 Letters

Now, we will identify the words in the text that are longer than 6 letters:
- "considered" (10)
- "businesses" (10)
- "sustainable" (10)
- "environmental" (12)
- "purchasing" (9)
- "procurement" (11)
- "purpose" (7)
- "education" (8)
- "Miljösäkrade" (12)
- "audiences’" (9)
- "knowledge" (9)
- "interests" (9)
- "attitudes" (8)
- "together" (8)

There are 13 words longer than 6 letters.

### Step 4: Apply the LIX Formula

Now we can use the LIX formula to compute the score:

\[
\text{LIX} = \frac{( \text{number of words} )}{( \text{number of sentences} )} + \frac{( \text{number of words longer than 6 letters} ) \times 100}{( \text{number of words} )}
\]

Substituting the counts we calculated:

- Number of words = 52
- Number of sentences = 3
- Number of words longer than 6 letters = 13

\[
\text{LIX} = \frac{52}{3} + \frac{13 \times 100}{52}
\]

Calculating each part:
- \(\frac{52}{3} \approx 17.33\)
- \(\frac{13 \times 100}{52} = \frac{1300}{52} \approx 25\)

Now add the two results together:
\[
\text{LIX} \approx 17.33 + 25 = 42.33
\]

Thus, rounding to the nearest whole number:
\[
\text{LIX} \approx 42
\]

Finally, we can present the result in the specified format:

LIX=42
