To calculate the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words:** 
   - The text has 74 words.

2. **Count the number of sentences:** 
   - The text has 5 sentences. (We consider sentences ending with periods as the main indicators).

3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters:**
   - The long words in the text are: "Övrigt", "Tillslut", "allting", "Bra", "för", "intressant", "Huvudpersonen", "agerar", "ansträngning" (total of 13 such words).

4. **Now, plug these values into the LIX formula:**
   \[
   LIX = \left( \frac{\text{number of words}}{\text{number of sentences}} \right) + \left( \frac{\text{number of words longer than 6 letters} \times 100}{\text{number of words}} \right)
   \]

5. **Calculating each part:**
   - **Number of words per sentence:**
     \[
     \frac{74}{5} = 14.8
     \]

   - **Percentage of long words:**
     \[
     \frac{13 \times 100}{74} \approx 17.57
     \]

6. **Final LIX score:**
   \[
   LIX = 14.8 + 17.57 \approx 32.37
   \]

Putting it all together, the calculated LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text is:

LIX=32.37
