To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we will follow the formula:

LIX = (Number of words) / (Number of sentences) + (Number of words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (Number of words)

### Step 1: Count the elements

1. **Number of words**: We need to count all the words in the text. Let's consider the given text in English for now:

   "In a passive house the walls are thicker than normal due to increased insulation, which puts higher demands on accuracy and detail planning in junctions, such as those for windows. It also creates other conditions for the expression of the facade and will imply further difficulties when placing the windows outermost in the wall."

   In total, this text consists of **41 words**.

2. **Number of sentences**: We can identify the sentences by counting the periods (.) in the text. There are **2 sentences**.

3. **Number of words longer than 6 letters**: Now we count the words that are longer than 6 letters.
   - "passive" (7)
   - "thicker" (7)
   - "increased" (9)
   - "insulation" (10)
   - "demands" (7)
   - "accuracy" (8)
   - "planning" (8)
   - "junctions" (9)
   - "conditions" (10)
   - "expression" (11)
   - "further" (7)
   - "difficulties" (12)
   - "placing" (7)
   - "outermost" (8)

   Counting these, we find **14 words longer than 6 letters**.

### Step 2: Calculate the LIX score

Now we will substitute these values into the LIX formula:

- Number of words = 41
- Number of sentences = 2
- Number of words longer than 6 letters = 14

LIX = (41 / 2) + (14 * 100 / 41)

Calculating each part:

1. **(Number of words) / (Number of sentences)** = 41 / 2 = 20.5
2. **(Number of words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (Number of words)** = (14 * 100) / 41 = 34.15 (approximately)

### Step 3: Final calculation

Now adding both parts together:

LIX = 20.5 + 34.15 = 54.65

### Conclusion

Thus, rounding to the nearest whole number, the readability score is:

LIX = 55.
