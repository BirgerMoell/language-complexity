To calculate the LIX readability score for the provided text, we need to follow the steps accurately:

1. **Count the number of words** in the text:
   The given text is: "The number of experts responsible for different parts of the design should, however, be kept to a minimum."
   - Number of words = 20

2. **Count the number of sentences** in the text:
   - There is 1 sentence in the text.

3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters**:
   - The words longer than 6 letters in the text: "responsible" (12), "different" (9), and "minimum" (7).
   - Number of words longer than 6 letters = 3

Now that we have all the necessary counts, we can substitute these values into the LIX formula:

LIX = (number of words / number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters * 100 / number of words)

Substituting in our values:
- Number of words = 20
- Number of sentences = 1
- Number of words longer than 6 letters = 3

Calculating each component:

1. \( \text{number of words / number of sentences} = 20 / 1 = 20 \)
2. \( \text{number of words longer than 6 letters * 100 / number of words} = (3 * 100) / 20 = 300 / 20 = 15 \)

Now, adding these two results together to find LIX:

\[ \text{LIX} = 20 + 15 = 35 \]

Thus, the final LIX score for the provided text is:

LIX=35
