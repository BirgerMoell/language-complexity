To calculate the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we first need to identify the following components:

1. **Total Number of Words**: Count all the words in the text.
2. **Total Number of Sentences**: Identify how many sentences are present.
3. **Number of Words Longer than 6 Letters**: Count words that exceed six letters in length.

Let's analyze the provided text step by step.

### Step 1: Count the total number of words
The text provided has a total of 84 words. 

### Step 2: Count the number of sentences
For the purpose of LIX, we consider any sequence of text that ends with a punctuation mark (such as period, question mark, or exclamation mark) to be a sentence. Counting the punctuation marks, we find there are **10 sentences** in the text.

### Step 3: Count the number of words longer than 6 letters
Next, we identify and count the words that are longer than 6 letters. In the text, the words "skillnader," "färgen," "pigment," "förtryckta," "egentligen," and "Källförteckning" stand out as longer-than-6-letter words. In total, there are **6 words** longer than 6 letters.

### Step 4: Plugging the values into LIX formula
Now we can plug these values into the LIX formula:
\[
\text{LIX} = \left(\frac{\text{number of words}}{\text{number of sentences}}\right) + \left(\frac{\text{number of long words} \times 100}{\text{number of words}}\right)
\]
Using our counts:
- Number of words = 84
- Number of sentences = 10
- Number of words longer than 6 letters = 6

Substituting these values into the formula gives:
\[
\text{LIX} = \left(\frac{84}{10}\right) + \left(\frac{6 \times 100}{84}\right)
\]
Calculating each part:
1. \(\frac{84}{10} = 8.4\)
2. \(\frac{6 \times 100}{84} = \frac{600}{84} = 7.142857\)

Now summing these two results:
\[
\text{LIX} = 8.4 + 7.142857 \approx 15.542857
\]

### Final Score 
LIX typically is rounded to the nearest whole number, so we round \(15.542857\) to \(16\).

Thus, the LIX readability score for the text is:

LIX=16
