To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we will follow the formula: 

**LIX = (Number of words / Number of sentences) + (Number of words longer than 6 letters * 100 / Number of words)**

Let's analyze the text step by step.

1. **Count the number of words**:  
   The provided text contains the following words:
   - The area of a building is a feature that can be regulated by a strict local plan (Detaljplan). However, VIP make it possible to reduce the thickness of the building envelope and you can thereby increase the area for selling with increased income as a result. Because of that, it is of interest to examine whether it can be profitable to use VIP in new buildings. To determine whether it is profitable to use VIP in outer walls, this study investigated two main scenarios.

   Total words = 74 (counting individual words).

2. **Count the number of sentences**:  
   The provided text consists of the following sentences:
   - The area of a building is a feature that can be regulated by a strict local plan (Detaljplan).
   - However, VIP make it possible to reduce the thickness of the building envelope and you can thereby increase the area for selling with increased income as a result.
   - Because of that, it is of interest to examine whether it can be profitable to use VIP in new buildings.
   - To determine whether it is profitable to use VIP in outer walls, this study investigated two main scenarios.

   Total sentences = 4.

3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters**:  
   We will identify and count words that have more than 6 letters:
   - regulated (8)
   - possible (8)
   - thickness (8)
   - envelope (8)
   - increase (8)
   - increased (9)
   - profitable (9)
   - determine (9)
   - investigated (10)

   Total words longer than 6 letters = 9.

Now we can plug these values into the LIX formula:

- Number of words = 74
- Number of sentences = 4
- Number of words longer than 6 letters = 9

Now, calculate each part of the LIX formula:

1. Words per sentence: \( \frac{74}{4} = 18.5 \)
2. Proportion of long words: \( \frac{9 \times 100}{74} \approx 12.16 \)

Adding these together gives:

**LIX = 18.5 + 12.16 = 30.66** (rounded to two decimal places).

Finally, the LIX score for the text is:

LIX=30.66
