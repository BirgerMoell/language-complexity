To compute the LIX readability score for the provided text, we first need to gather the necessary components: the number of words, the number of sentences, and the number of words longer than six letters.

### Step 1: Count the Components
**Text:** 
"The more I learn about this city, the more fascinated I get. Even though it’s young, it has already transformed itself multiple times and survived both super expansive growth and fire and depression. But it is also a city where the different eras have put its mark, and you can clearly read the layers of development. But I’m afraid that some things will get lost, some of the things that make Seattle special."

1. **Count the number of words:**
   - Total words: 72

2. **Count the number of sentences:**
   - Total sentences: 4

3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters:**
   - Words longer than 6 letters: fascinated (9), transformed (10), multiple (8), expansive (8), depression (8), different (9), clearly (7), development (11), afraid (7), Seattle (7).
   - Total words longer than 6 letters: 10 

### Step 2: Apply the LIX Formula

Using the LIX formula:
\[
LIX = \frac{(\text{number of words})}{(\text{number of sentences})} + \frac{(\text{number of words longer than 6 letters}) \times 100}{(\text{number of words})}
\]

Substituting in the counts:
- Number of words = 72
- Number of sentences = 4
- Number of words longer than 6 letters = 10

#### Calculation:

1. Calculate the first part:
   \[
   \frac{72}{4} = 18
   \]

2. Calculate the second part:
   \[
   \frac{10 \times 100}{72} \approx 13.89
   \]

3. Combine both parts:
   \[
   LIX = 18 + 13.89 \approx 31.89
   \]

### Result
Thus, the LIX readability score computed from the provided text is approximately 31.89. 

Final output: 
LIX=31.89
