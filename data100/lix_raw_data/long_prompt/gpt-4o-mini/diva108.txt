To calculate the LIX (Readable Index), we first need to analyze the text provided. Let's break it down step by step.

### Steps to Calculate LIX

1. **Count the number of words**: 
   The total number of words in the provided text is 93.

2. **Count the number of sentences**:
   The text has 4 sentences. They are:
   1. "Rising costs of energy, combined with an increasing environmental consciousness on the part of building owners, render timely the law on certification of buildings for energy efficiency."
   2. "The work presented here has investigated the use to clients of new businesses that have appeared through the certification law, as well as the market place such businesses can enjoy."
   3. "The latter has two mainstays, the customers, building owners, on the one hand, and on the other the agents of control, i. e.,"

3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters**:
   The following words have more than 6 letters:
   - Rising (6)
   - Combined (8)
   - Increasing (9)
   - Consciousness (12)
   - Certification (11)
   - Efficiency (9)
   - Presented (8)
   - Investigated (13)
   - Businesses (10)
   - Appeared (8)
   - Certification (11)
   - Market place (10)
   - Building (7)
   - Mainstays (8)
   - Customers (8)

   Total: 14 words longer than 6 letters.

### Putting it All Together for LIX

Now we can apply the LIX formula:

\[
\text{LIX} = \frac{\text{number of words}}{\text{number of sentences}} + \frac{\text{number of words longer than 6 letters} \times 100}{\text{number of words}}
\]

Plugging in the numbers:

- Number of words = 93
- Number of sentences = 4
- Number of words longer than 6 letters = 14

Calculating each part:

\[
\frac{93}{4} = 23.25
\]

\[
\frac{14 \times 100}{93} = \frac{1400}{93} \approx 15.05
\]

Now add these two results together:

\[
\text{LIX} = 23.25 + 15.05 \approx 38.30
\]

### Final Result

Thus, the LIX readability score for the provided text is:

LIX=38.3
