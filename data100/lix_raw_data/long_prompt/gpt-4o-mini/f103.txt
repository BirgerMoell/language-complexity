To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we will follow the steps outlined in the LIX formula:

LIX = (number of words) / (number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (number of words)

1. **Count the number of words**: 
   - Let's count the words in the text.
   - The provided text has a total of 101 words.

2. **Count the number of sentences**: 
   - We need to identify the sentences in the text. Each sentence ends with a period (.), so we will count the periods. 
   - The text contains 5 sentences.

3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters**: 
   - We need to identify the words that are longer than 6 letters.
   - The words longer than 6 letters in the text are: "arbetet" (8), "skicka" (7), "exempel" (7), "filöverföringen" (15), "protokollet" (12), "överföring" (10), "programmet" (10), "domännamnet" (12).
   - This gives us a total of 8 words longer than 6 letters.

Now we can plug these values into the LIX formula:

- Number of words = 101
- Number of sentences = 5
- Number of words longer than 6 letters = 8

LIX calculation:

LIX = (101 / 5) + (8 * 100 / 101)

Breaking it down:

1. 101 / 5 = 20.2
2. 8 * 100 = 800
3. 800 / 101 = 7.92 (approximately)

Now, adding these two results together:

LIX = 20.2 + 7.92 = 28.12 (approximately)

Finally, rounding to two decimal places, we have:

LIX = 28.12

So the final result is:

LIX=28.12
