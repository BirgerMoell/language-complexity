To calculate the LIX readability score for the provided text, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words**.
2. **Count the number of sentences**.
3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters**.
4. **Apply the LIX formula**.

### Step-by-Step Calculation

**Text**:
"One path of exposure is vapour transport of pollutants into buildings. Today, new buildings are already being constructed on contaminated land, and in the future contaminated land will probably constitute an important part of the exploitable land with population growing. It is therefore of great importance to be able to ensure that buildings built on contaminated land gets an acceptable indoor environment."

**1. Count the number of words**:  
Let's break it down:
- Sentence 1: 12 words
- Sentence 2: 41 words
- Sentence 3: 26 words

Total number of words = 12 + 41 + 26 = **79 words**.

**2. Count the number of sentences**:  
The text contains 3 sentences.

**3. Count the number of words longer than 6 letters**:
- "exposure" (8)
- "vapour" (6)
- "transport" (9)
- "pollutants" (10)
- "buildings" (8)
- "constructed" (12)
- "contaminated" (12)
- "probably" (8)
- "constitute" (10)
- "important" (9)
- "exploitable" (12)
- "population" (8)
- "importance" (9)
- "acceptable" (9)
- "environment" (11)

Total number of words longer than 6 letters = **15**.

### Applying the LIX formula

Using the LIX formula:
\[
LIX = \left(\frac{\text{number of words}}{\text{number of sentences}}\right) + \left(\frac{\text{number of words longer than 6 letters} \times 100}{\text{number of words}}\right)
\]

Substituting the values:
- Number of words = 79
- Number of sentences = 3
- Number of words longer than 6 letters = 15

\[
LIX = \left(\frac{79}{3}\right) + \left(\frac{15 \times 100}{79}\right)
\]
Calculating each part:
- \( \frac{79}{3} \approx 26.33 \)
- \( \frac{15 \times 100}{79} \approx 18.99 \)

Now summing these values:
\[
LIX \approx 26.33 + 18.99 \approx 45.32
\]

### Final Result
We round the LIX score to the nearest hundredth for presentation:

LIX = 45.32
