To calculate the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words**: We will count each word in the text.
2. **Count the number of sentences**: We will identify how many sentences are present in the text.
3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters**: We will identify and count the words that have more than 6 letters.

Now, let's analyze the provided text step by step:

### Step 1: Count the Words
The text provided contains the following words:

"The proposed technical solution is building with studs of steel and only using three layers of insulation in the walls. New standards from The National board of housing, building and planning has influenced the proposal of steel studs. The disadvantage is that the technique of building with steel studs is often new to carpenters and thus requires more time. The passive house concept is also new. As follows, two new aspects concurrently come into play."

**Total number of words = 60**

### Step 2: Count the Sentences
Next, we count the number of sentences in the text. A sentence typically ends with a period, exclamation mark, or question mark. 

The sentences are as follows:
1. The proposed technical solution is building with studs of steel and only using three layers of insulation in the walls.
2. New standards from The National board of housing, building and planning has influenced the proposal of steel studs.
3. The disadvantage is that the technique of building with steel studs is often new to carpenters and thus requires more time.
4. The passive house concept is also new.
5. As follows, two new aspects concurrently come into play.

**Total number of sentences = 5**

### Step 3: Count the Words Longer than 6 Letters
Now we will count the words longer than 6 letters:
- proposed (8)
- technical (9)
- solution (8)
- building (8)
- insulation (10)
- standards (9)
- influenced (10)
- disadvantage (11)
- technique (9)
- carpenters (9)
- requires (8)
- concept (7)
- concurrently (12)

**Total number of words longer than 6 letters = 13**

### LIX Calculation
Now we can calculate the LIX score using the formula:

\[
LIX = \left( \frac{\text{number of words}}{\text{number of sentences}} \right) + \left( \frac{\text{number of words longer than 6 letters} \times 100}{\text{number of words}} \right)
\]

Plugging in the values we calculated:
- Number of words = 60
- Number of sentences = 5
- Number of words longer than 6 letters = 13

Calculating each part:
1. \( \frac{60}{5} = 12 \)
2. \( \frac{13 \times 100}{60} = \frac{1300}{60} \approx 21.67 \)

Now, we sum these two results:
\[
LIX = 12 + 21.67 \approx 33.67
\]

### Final Result
We write the result in the specified format:

LIX=33.67
