To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we need to follow the formula you provided, which is:

LIX = (number of words / number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters * 100 / number of words)

### Steps to Calculate LIX

1. **Count the number of words**:
   We need to count each word in the provided text.

2. **Count the number of sentences**:
   Identify how many complete sentences are in the text.

3. **Count the number of words longer than 6 letters**:
   Go through the text and identify any words that have more than 6 letters.

### Analyzing the Provided Text

Let’s break down the given text:

**Text**: 
```

```

#### Step 1: Count the Number of Words
Total words: 53

#### Step 2: Count the Number of Sentences
Sentences (as separated by full stops or other sentence-ending punctuation):
- "The essay describes the need for solutions in offices in form of accessories that support an activity-based approach."
- "Suggested accessories that solve problems studied are presented."

Total sentences: 2

#### Step 3: Count the Number of Words Longer than 6 Letters
Identifying words with more than 6 letters:
- Bachelor (7)
- Science (7)
- Accessories (10)
- Workplace (9)
- Activity-based (hyphenated compound, counted as 1 word with 14 letters)
- Solutions (8)
- Presented (8)
- Problems (8)
- Commissioner (10)
- Contact (7)
- Mattiassson (9)

Total words longer than 6 letters: 11

Now that we have our counts, we can plug these into the LIX formula.

### LIX Calculation
1. Number of words = 53
2. Number of sentences = 2
3. Number of words longer than 6 letters = 11

Plugging into the formula:

LIX = (53 / 2) + (11 * 100 / 53)  
LIX = 26.5 + (1100 / 53)  
LIX = 26.5 + 20.75  
LIX ≈ 47.25

### Final Result
Rounding isn’t strictly required unless otherwise specified, but for the purpose of readability, we’ll report the final score as follows:

LIX = 47.25
