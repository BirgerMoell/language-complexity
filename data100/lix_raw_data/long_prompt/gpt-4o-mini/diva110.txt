To compute the LIX readability score from the provided text, we need to follow the formula: 

LIX = (number of words / number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters * 100 / number of words).

Let's break down the provided text:

### Step 1: Count the Number of Words
The provided text is:
"The suggested solution uses a translation layer called Metadata FTL (MFTL), where file system metadata and userdata are separated from each other in order to improve performance. The partition holding userdata uses a block-level mapped translation layer system called Fully Associative Sector Translation FTL. The other partition, holding metadata, will instead use a page-level mapped translation layer system which also separates often modified data from data modified seldom."

- **Word Count:** 78 words.

### Step 2: Count the Number of Sentences
To count the sentences, we can look for the full stops (.) in the text:

1. "The suggested solution uses a translation layer called Metadata FTL (MFTL), where file system metadata and userdata are separated from each other in order to improve performance."
2. "The partition holding userdata uses a block-level mapped translation layer system called Fully Associative Sector Translation FTL."
3. "The other partition, holding metadata, will instead use a page-level mapped translation layer system which also separates often modified data from data modified seldom."

- **Sentence Count:** 3 sentences.

### Step 3: Count the Number of Words Longer Than 6 Letters
Now we count the words longer than 6 letters in the text:
- "suggested" (9)
- "solution" (8)
- "translation" (12)
- "metadata" (8)
- "separated" (9)
- "improve" (7)
- "performance" (11)
- "partition" (8)
- "userdata" (8)
- "block-level" (11)
- "mapped" (6, not counted)
- "translation" (12)
- "associative" (12)
- "separation" (8)
- "modified" (8)
- "seldom" (6, not counted)

Total count of words longer than 6 letters: 12.

### Step 4: Calculate the LIX Score
Now plug in the values into the LIX formula:

LIX = (number of words / number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters * 100 / number of words)

LIX = (78 / 3) + (12 * 100 / 78)

Calculating each part:
- (78 / 3) = 26
- (12 * 100 / 78) ≈ 15.38

Adding these results together:
LIX ≈ 26 + 15.38 ≈ 41.38

### Final result:
Rounding to a more standard format, we get:
LIX = 41.38.

Thus, the final output is:
LIX=41.38.
