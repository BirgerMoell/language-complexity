To calculate the LIX score, I will need to analyze the given Swedish text, but first I will translate the text into English if the translation isn't already provided (it seems to be partially translated into English or the original was written in English). 

Here is the given text: 
"One path of exposure is vapour transport of pollutants into buildings. Today, new buildings are already being constructed on contaminated land, and in the future contaminated land will probably constitute and important part of the exploitable land with population growing. It is therefore of great importance to be able to ensure that buildings built on contaminated land gets an acceptable indoor environment."

This text seems to be written in English, so we can use the given English text for analysis.

Breaking down the text into its components:
- Number of words: 
  1. One 
  2. path 
  3. of 
  4. exposure 
  5. is 
  6. vapour 
  7. transport 
  8. of 
  9. pollutants 
  10. into 
  11. buildings 
  12. Today 
  13. new 
  14. buildings 
  15. are 
  16. already 
  17. being 
  18. constructed 
  19. on 
  20. contaminated 
  21. land 
  22. and 
  23. in 
  24. the 
  25. future 
  26. contaminated 
  27. land 
  28. will 
  29. probably 
  30. constitute 
  31. and 
  32. important 
  33. part 
  34. of 
  35. the 
  36. exploitable 
  37. land 
  38. with 
  39. population 
  40. growing 
  41. It 
  42. is 
  43. therefore 
  44. of 
  45. great 
  46. importance 
  47. to 
  48. be 
  49. able 
  50. to 
  51. ensure 
  52. that 
  53. buildings 
  54. built 
  55. on 
  56. contaminated 
  57. land 
  58. gets 
  59. an 
  60. acceptable 
  61. indoor 
  62. environment
  Total number of words = 62
- Number of sentences: 
  Sentence 1: One path of exposure is vapour transport of pollutants into buildings.
  Sentence 2: Today, new buildings are already being constructed on contaminated land, and in the future contaminated land will probably constitute and important part of the exploitable land with population growing.
  Sentence 3: It is therefore of great importance to be able to ensure that buildings built on contaminated land gets an acceptable indoor environment.
  Total number of sentences = 3
- Number of words longer than 6 letters:
  Transport, pollutants, constructed, contaminated (three occurrences), probably, constitute, important, exploitable, population, growing, acceptable, environment.
  However, we counted "contaminated" only 3 times as per occurrence, and 'growing' has 7 letters. More words to add to the list: exposure, vapour. Moreover, according to the rules: exposure vapour transport and some other may contain more than six letters.
   After the manually inspected check we have 22 occurrences 
Now, I will use these values to calculate the LIX score. 

LIX = ((Number of words)/(Number of sentences)) + ((Number of words longer than 6 letters)*100)/(Number of words)

LIX = ((62)/(3)) + ((22*100)/(62))
LIX ≈ 20.67 + 35.48
LIX ≈ 56.15
