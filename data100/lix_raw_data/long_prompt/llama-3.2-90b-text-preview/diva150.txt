To calculate the LIX score, we first need to determine the number of words, sentences, and words longer than 6 letters in the text.

1. Number of words:
   1. An
   2. extensive
   3. literature
   4. study
   5. has
   6. been
   7. made
   8. to
   9. evaluate
   10. all
   11. techniques
   12. on
   13. the
   14. market
   15. and
   16. characterize
   17. what
   18. separates
   19. the
   20. different
   21. processes
   22. Also
   23. machine
   24. performance
   25. and
   26. material
   27. quality
   28. is
   29. evaluated
   30. and
   31. advantages
   32. and
   33. disadvantages
   34. are
   35. listed
   36. for
   37. each
   38. technique
   39. The
   40. techniques
   41. are
   42. widely
   43. separated
   44. in
   45. powder
   46. bed
   47. processes
   48. and
   49. material
   50. deposition
   51. processes
   52. The
   53. powder
   54. bed
   55. techniques
   56. allow
   57. more
   58. design
   59. freedom
   60. while
   61. the
   62. material
   63. deposition
   64. techniques
   65. allow
   66. production
   67. of
   68. large
   69. articles

   There are 69 words in the text.

2. Number of sentences:
   There are 4 sentences in the text:
   1. An extensive literature study has been made to evaluate all techniques on the market and  characterize what separates the different processes.
   2. Also machine performance and material  quality is evaluated, and advantages and disadvantages are listed for each technique.
   3. The  techniques are widely separated in powder bed processes and material deposition processes.
   4. The  powder bed techniques allow more design freedom while the material deposition techniques  allow production of large articles.

3. Number of words longer than 6 letters:
   1. extensive
   2. literature
   3. characterize
   4. evaluates
   5. machines 
   6. performance
   7. material
   8. quality
   9. evaluated
   10. advantages
   11. disadvantages
   12. deposition
   13. material
   14. production
   15. separate
   16. articles

   There are 16 words longer than 6 letters in the text.

Now, we calculate the LIX score as follows:
   (number of words)/(number of sentences) = 69/4 = 17.25
   (number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words) = 16*100/69 = 23.19
   LIX score = 17.25 + 23.19 = 40.44

Therefore:
LIX= 40.44
