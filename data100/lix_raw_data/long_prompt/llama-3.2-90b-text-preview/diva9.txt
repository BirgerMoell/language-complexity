To calculate the LIX score, we first need to find the number of words and sentences in the text.

Here's the text broken down into sentences and words:

 Sentence 1: The empirical investigation is primary based upon qualitative interviews with public officials in seven Swedish municipalities.
 1. The
 2. empirical
 3. investigation
 4. is
 5. primary
 6. based
 7. upon
 8. qualitative
 9. interviews
 10. with
 11. public
 12. officials
 13. in
 14. seven
 15. Swedish
 16. municipalities

 Sentence 2: The study concludes in that ‘a sense of place’ as defined within the study, is highly relevant and present in Swedish municipal planning practice.
 1. The
 2. study
 3. concludes
 4. in
 5. that
 6. ‘a
 7. sense
 8. of
 9. place’
 10. as
 11. defined
 12. within
 13. the
 14. study
 15. is
 16. highly
 17. relevant
 18. and
 19. present
 20. in
 21. Swedish
 22. municipal
 23. planning
 24. practice

There are 2 sentences and 40 words in the text.

Next, we need to find the number of words longer than 6 letters:
 1. empirical
 2. investigation
 3. qualitative
 4. interviews
 5. municipal
 6. municipalities
 7. relevant
 8. municipal
 9. planning
 10. concludes
 11. defined
 12. highly
 13. relevant
 14. municipal

There are 14 words longer than 6 letters.

Now we can calculate LIX:

(Number of words)/(Number of sentences) = 40/2 = 20
(Number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(Number of words) = 14*100/40 = 35

LIX = 20 + 35 = 55

LIX= 55
