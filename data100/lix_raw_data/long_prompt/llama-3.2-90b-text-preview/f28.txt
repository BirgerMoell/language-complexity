To calculate the LIX score, I will first break down the text into its components:

1. Number of words: 
   Så (1) 
   därför (2) 
   skulle (3) 
   ju (4) 
   det (5) 
   vara (6) 
   bättre (7) 
   att (8) 
   bo (9) 
   vid (10) 
   andra (11) 
   floder (12) 
   som (13) 
   nilen (14)
   Total number of words: 14

2. Number of sentences: 1 (There's only one sentence in this text, but officially it should end with a full stop. In the calculation, however, we treat the text as a single sentence.)

3. Number of words longer than 6 letters: 
   därför (6 letters - 1), 
   skulle (7 letters), 
   bättre (7 letters), 
   andra (5 letters - 0), 
   floder (6 letters - 1)
   Total number of words longer than 6 letters: 3

Now I will calculate the LIX score using a calculator: 
LIX score = (14 / 1) + (3 * 100 / 14) 
LIX score ≈ 14 + 21.43 
LIX score ≈ 35.43 

Rounded to a common LIX notation with two decimal places or whole integers, we would use the integer, so the final answer is:

LIX = 35
