To calculate the LIX readability score for the given text, we need to count the following elements:

- Number of words
- Number of sentences
- Number of words longer than 6 letters

First, let's break down the text into individual words and count them:

1. The
2. measurements
3. to
4. be
5. performed
6. in
7. the
8. attics
9. were
10. air
11. temperature
12. relative
13. humidity
14. moisture
15. ratio
16. and
17. air
18. change
19. rate
20. Since
21. the
22. climate
23. in
24. the
25. attics
26. is
27. dependent
28. on
29. the
30. outdoor
31. climate
32. it
33. was
34. decided
35. that
36. outdoor
37. climate
38. data
39. would
40. be
41. collected
42. as
43. well
44. Moisture
45. ratios
46. of
47. similar
48. points
49. in
50. the
51. different
52. objects
53. were
54. measured
55. in
56. order
57. to
58. estimate
59. the
60. cause
61. of
62. these
63. differences

Number of words: 63

Next, we need to count the number of sentences. In this case, there are 3 sentences.

Number of sentences: 3

Lastly, we need to count the number of words longer than 6 letters:
1. measurements
2. performed
3. temperature
4. relative
5. moisture
6. dependent
7. decided
8. collected
9. similar
10. different
11. measured
12. estimate

Number of words longer than 6 letters: 12

Now, we can use these values to calculate the LIX readability score:

(score=(number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words))
score=(63/3)+(12*100/63)

Using a calculator:
First, divide the number of words by the number of sentences: 63/3 = 21
Then, multiply the number of words longer than 6 letters by 100: 12*100 = 1200
Divide the result by the number of words: 1200/63 ≈ 19.048
Finally, add the two results: 21 + 19.048 ≈ 40.05

So the LIX score for the text is approximately 40.05.

LIX=40.05
