For calculating the LIX readability score, I first broke down the given Swedish text into individual words and sentences. 

Number of sentences: 7

Number of words: 76

To find words longer than 6 letters, I manually counted them:
 
 Longer words (more than 6 letters): 25 
 words: (rasisterna, innerst, drastiskt, invandrade, amerikanarna, bättre, skillnad)

Now I will calculate the LIX using the formula:
LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
LIX = (76/7)+(25*100)/76
LIX = 10.857142+(2500/76)
LIX ≈ 10.857142+32.895
LIX ≈ 43.75214 

So the final LIX readability score for the given text is:
LIX = 43.8
