To calculate the LIX score, we need to break down the text into its components:

1. Number of words: The text has 46 words.
   1. The
   2. proposed
   3. technical
   4. solution
   5. is
   6. building
   7. with
   8. studs
   9. of
   10. steel
   11. and
   12. only
   13. using
   14. three
   15. layers
   16. of
   17. insulation
   18. in
   19. the
   20. walls
   21. New
   22. standards
   23. from
   24. The
   25. National
   26. board
   27. of
   28. housing
   29. building
   30. and
   31. planning
   32. has
   33. influenced
   34. the
   35. proposal
   36. of
   37. steel
   38. studs
   39. The
   40. disadvantage
   41. is
   42. that
   43. the
   44. technique
   45. of
   46. building
   47. with
   48. steel
   49. studs
   50. is
   51. often
   52. new
   53. to
   54. carpenters
   55. and
   56. thus
   57. requires
   58. more
   59. time
   60. The
   61. passive
   62. house
   63. concept
   64. is
   65. also
   66. new
   67. As
   68. follows
   69. two
   70. new
   71. aspects
   72. concurrently
   73. come
   74. into
   75. play

2. Number of sentences: The text has 4 sentences:
   Sentence 1: The proposed technical solution is building with studs of steel and only using three layers of insulation in the walls.
   Sentence 2: New standards from The National board of housing, building and planning has influenced the proposal of steel studs.
   Sentence 3: The disadvantage is that the technique of building with steel studs is often new to carpenters and thus requires more time.
   Sentence 4: The passive house concept is also new. As follows, two new aspects concurrently come into play.

To further simplify the last sentence into two distinct sentences we would get:
  Sentence 3:  The disadvantage is that the technique of building with steel studs is often new to carpenters and thus requires more time.
  Sentence 4:  The passive house concept is also new.
  Sentence 5:  As follows, two new aspects concurrently come into play.

   Hence we need to correct the number of sentences to 5 (or treat sentence four-five as one), If we keep it as is we get a different result.
   To also stay as faithful as possible to LIX as originally described, the number of sentences will be 4.

3. Number of words longer than 6 letters: 
   There are 21 words longer than 6 letters in the given text:
   1. technical
   2. insulation
   3. standards
   4. National
   5. housing
   6. planning
   7. proposal
   8. disadvantage
   9. requires
   10. technique
   11. pasive
   12. concurrently
   13. concurrently is longer than 6 letters but was the only one not corrected before listed and only the word 'passive' is one of the actual of 21 
   14. concurrently was listed again. Here are the other 7 words longer than six letters
   15. building 
   16. carpenters
   17. concept
   18. building 

 Now that we have all the necessary information, we can calculate the LIX score:

 (Number of words)/(Number of sentences) = 46/4 = 11.5
 (Number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(Number of words) = 21*100/46 = 45.65

 Combine the results, dropping the second half decimal
 LIX = 11 + 45.65
  LIX = 56.65
