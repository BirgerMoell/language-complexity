To calculate the LIX score, we first need to translate the text to Swedish. However, since it's not Swedish, we need to proceed with this in mind (I'm assuming this text might have been in English, considering it's not actually in Swedish).

The steps to calculate LIX score are:
1. Count the total number of words.
2. Count the total number of sentences.
3. Count the total number of words with more than 6 letters.
4. Use the LIX formula: LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words).

After analyzing the text, we have:
Number of words: 56 (manually counted - this number could possibly be incorrect if errors in interpretation of punctuation occurred)
- However I counted them:
  1. The 
  2. industry 
  3. had 
  4. three 
  5. different 
  6. production 
  7. divisions 
  8. and 
  9. only 
  10. one 
  11. of 
  12. these 
  13. was 
  14. studied, 
  15. the 
  16. so 
  17. called 
  18. “Blå 
  19. linan”. 
  20. During 
  21. the 
  22. study, 
  23. the 
  24. production 
  25. on 
  26. the 
  27. “Blå 
  28. linan” 
  29. consisted 
  30. of 
  31. solid 
  32. concrete 
  33. beams 
  34. and 
  35. solid 
  36. concrete 
  37. walls. 
  38. To 
  39. identify 
  40. the 
  41. “bottlenecks” 
  42. in 
  43. the 
  44. production, 
  45. a 
  46. time 
  47. study 
  48. was 
  49. made 
  50. where 
  51. the 
  52. cycle 
  53. time 
  54. was 
  55. analysed. 
  56. Furthermore, 
  57. a 
  58. work 
  59. sampling 
  60. was 
  61. carried 
  62. out 
  63. and 
  64. the 
  65. content 
  66. of 
  67. work 
  68. in 
  69. the 
  70. workstations 
  71. which 
  72. were 
  73. earlier 
  74. identified 
  75. as 
  76. bottlenecks 
  77. were 
  78. observed.

Sentence 1:  The industry had three different production divisions and only one of these was studied, the so called “Blå linan”. 
Sentence 2: During the study, the production on the “Blå linan” consisted of solid concrete beams and solid concrete walls. 
Sentence 3: To identify the “bottlenecks” in the production, a time study was made where the cycle time was analysed. 
Sentence 4: Furthermore, a work sampling was carried out and the content of work in the workstations which were earlier identified as bottlenecks were observed.

Number of sentences: 4
Number of words: 78 
(I've now recounted - a more accurate answer with punctuation marked)

Number of words longer than 6 letters:
These words were identified as the ones with more than 6 letters:
  6. production 
  17. called 
  24. production 
  40. identify 
  44. production 
  59. sampling 
  69. workstations 
  73. earlier 
  74. identified 
  70. workstations 

The total number of words with more than 6 letters is 10.

Then LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words) becomes 
LIX = 78 / 4 + 10 * 100 / 78 ≈ 19.5 + 12.8 ≈ 32.3.

The result is:
LIX = 32.3.
