To calculate the LIX score, we need to break down the given text.

First, we count the number of words:

1. Since
2. China
3. is
4. still
5. considered
6. a
7. developing
8. country,
9. it
10. is
11. also
12. still
13. a
14. lot
15. different
16. from
17. Sweden,
18. but
19. it
20. is
21. changing
22. rapidly.
23. Most
24. of
25. the
26. environmental
27. laws
28. that
29. were
30. studied
31. are
32. parts
33. of
34. the
35. legal
36. framework,
37. which
38. means
39. that
40. no
41. exact
42. limits
43. or
44. detailed
45. guidelines
46. are
47. given.
48. The
49. company
50. brings
51. its
52. cutting-edge
53. technology,
54. which
55. still
56. is
57. new
58. and
59. unknown
60. to
61. the
62. industrial
63. park
64. in
65. China.
66. Therefore
67. it
68. is
69. too
70. early
71. to
72. decide
73. whether
74. company
75. F
76. complies
77. with
78. the
79. local
80. jurisdiction
81. in
82. China.

There are 82 words in the text.

Next, we count the number of sentences:
1. Since China is still considered a developing country, it is also  still a lot different from Sweden, but it is changing rapidly. 
2. Most of the environmental laws  that were studied are parts of the legal framework, which means that no exact limits or  detailed guidelines are given. 
3. The company brings its cutting-edge technology, which still is  new and unknown to the industrial park in China. 
4. Therefore it is too early to decide whether  company F complies with the local jurisdiction in China.

There are 4 sentences in the text.

Lastly, we count the number of words with more than 6 letters:
1. considered
2. developing
3. environmental
4. detailed
5. cutting-edge
6. technology
7. unknown
8. industrial
9. jurisdiction
10. complies

There are 10 words with more than 6 letters.

Now, let's compute the LIX score using a calculator:
 
   82 (number of words)/4 (number of sentences)        = 20.5
  + 10 (number of words with more than 6 letters) * 100/82 (number of words) =  12.20
LIX score = 32.7
