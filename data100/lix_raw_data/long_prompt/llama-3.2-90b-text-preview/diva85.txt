To calculate the LIX score, we need to break down the text into its components. 

First, let's count the number of words: 
1. Especially 
2. I 
3. want 
4. to 
5. thank 
6.  
7. My 
8. academic 
9. supervisor 
10. Martin 
11. Törngren 
12. who 
13. despite 
14. a 
15. heavy 
16. workload 
17. have 
18. contributed 
19. with 
20. a 
21. lot 
22. of 
23. valuable 
24. feedback 
25. and 
26. help 
27. with 
28. this 
29. thesis 
30.  
31. My 
32. supervisors 
33. at 
34. Regin 
35. Anders 
36. Ågren 
37. who 
38. have 
39. been 
40. supporting 
41. and 
42. supplying 
43. me 
44. with 
45. the 
46. adequate 
47. software 
48. tools 
49. to 
50. be 
51. able 
52. to 
53. debug 
54. the 
55. implementation 
56. Lars 
57. Matsson 
58. for 
59. helping 
60. me 
61. with 
62. code 
63. optimization 
64. and 
65. the 
66. temporary 
67. fixes 
68. to 
69. produce 
70. a 
71. lean 
72. Regio 
73. firmware

There are 73 words in the text.

Next, let's count the number of sentences: 
1. Especially, I want to thank    My academic supervisor Martin Törngren who, despite a heavy workload, have contributed with a lot of  valuable feedback and help with this thesis.
2.    My supervisors at Regin: Anders Ågren who have been supporting and supplying me with the adequate  software tools to be able to debug the implementation. 
3. Lars Matsson for helping me with code  optimization and the temporary fixes to produce a lean Regio firmware.

There are 3 sentences in the text.

Now, let's count the number of words longer than 6 letters: 
1. Especially
2. valuable
3. academic
4. contributed
5. optimization
6. supplying
7. adequate
8. supporting
9. supervisors
10. implementation
11. software
12. temporary
13. feedback
14. optimization
15. contributed
16. superviso

There are 16 words longer than 6 letters (Note that each word should be counted only once).

Now we can plug these numbers into the LIX formula: 
LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (number of words)
LIX = (73) / (3) + (16) * 100 / (73) 
LIX = 24.333 + 219.178
 LIX =  243.51 

LIX=  243.51
