To calculate the LIX score, we will break down the given text:

1. Number of words:
   1. An
   2. academic
   3. benchmark
   4. case
   5. Unsteady
   6. Aerodynamics
   7. Experiment
   8. Phase
   9. III
   10. was
   11. selected
   12. as
   13. a
   14. starting
   15. point
   16. of
   17. the
   18. optimization
   19. because
   20. wind
   21. tunnel
   22. data
   23. was
   24. available
   25. for
   26. that
   27. campain
   28. With
   29. the
   30. geometry
   31. developed
   32. by
   33. the
   34. genetic
   35. algoritm
   36. a
   37. theoretical
   38. increase
   39. of
   40. 15
   41. %
   42. more
   43. power
   44. could
   45. be
   46. extracted
   47. However
   48. it
   49. has
   50. been
   51. shown
   52. that
   53. the
   54. model
   55. has
   56. shortcomings
   57. at
   58. high
   59. wind
   60. speeds
   61. where
   62. the
   63. predicted
   64. power
   65. does
   66. not
   67. match
   68. wind
   69. tunnel
   70. data

There are 70 words in the text.

2. Number of sentences:
   1. An academic benchmark case (Unsteady Aerodynamics Experiment Phase III) was selected as a starting point of the optimization because wind tunnel data was available for that campain.
   2. With the geometry developed by the genetic algoritm a theoretical increase of 15 % more power could be extracted.
   3. However, it has been shown that the model has shortcomings at high wind speeds where the predicted power does not match wind tunnel data.

There are 3 sentences.

3. Number of words longer than 6 letters:
   1. academic
   2. benchmark
   3. Aerodynamics
   4. optimization
   5. geometry
   6. developed
   7. genetic
   8. algoritm
   9. theoretical
   10. increase
   11. extracted
   12. shortcomings
   13. predicted
   14. Unsteady
   15. Experiment
   16. Phase
 is not included since Phase is a 5 letter word and  since we only include words longer than 6 letters.

There are 16 words longer than 6 letters.

Now, let's calculate LIX score using the given formula:
LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
LIX = (70)/(3)+(16*100)/70
LIX = 23.33 + 22.86
LIX â‰ˆ 46.19

LIX=46.19
