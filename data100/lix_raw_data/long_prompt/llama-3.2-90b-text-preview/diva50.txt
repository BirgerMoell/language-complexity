To calculate the LIX score, we need to break down the given text into words, sentences, and words longer than 6 letters.

Here's the breakdown:

1. Total number of words: 
- Let's count the individual words in the given text:
   1. The
   2. process
   3. for
   4. purchase
   5. is
   6. considered
   7. by
   8. many
   9. to
   10. be
   11. a
   12. key
   13. factor
   14. in
   15. businesses
   16. work
   17. towards
   18. sustainable
   19. development
   20. Key
   21. people
   22. in
   23. this
   24. process
   25. and
   26. target
   27. audience
   28. for
   29. this
   30. education
   31. is
   32. environmental
   33. purchasing
   34. and
   35. procurement
   36. managers
   37. The
   38. purpose
   39. of
   40. this
   41. study
   42. is
   43. to
   44. design
   45. an
   46. education
   47. called
   48. Miljösäkrade
   49. inköp
   50. from
   51. the
   52. target
   53. audiences’
   54. knowledge
   55. interests
   56. and
   57. attitudes
   58. together
   59. with
   60. literature
There are 60 words in total.

2. Total number of sentences:
- Let's count the individual sentences in the given text:
   1. The process for purchase is considered by many to be a key factor in businesses work towards sustainable development.
   2. Key people in this process and target audience for this education is environmental, purchasing and procurement managers.
   3. The purpose of this study is to design an education called Miljösäkrade inköp from the target audiences’ knowledge, interests and attitudes, together with literature.
There are 3 sentences in total.

3. Total number of words longer than 6 letters:
- Let's count the words with more than 6 letters in the given text:
   1. considered
   2. businesses
   3. sustainable
   4. development
   5. purchasing
   6. procurement
   7. environmental
   8. education
   9. audiences’
   10. knowledge
   11. interests
   12. attitudes
   13. literature
   14. Miljösäkrade
There are 14 words with more than 6 letters.

Now we have all the necessary values to calculate the LIX score:
- Number of words = 60
- Number of sentences = 3
- Number of words longer than 6 letters = 14

The LIX formula is: (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)

Using a calculator:
(60/3) + (14*100/60) = 20 + 23.33 = 43.33

LIX = 43.33
