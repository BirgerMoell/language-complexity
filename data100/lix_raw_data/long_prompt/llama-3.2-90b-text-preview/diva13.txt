To calculate the LIX score, we'll start by counting the words in the given text. 

1. The
2. purpose
3. of
4. this
5. study
6. was
7. to
8. investigate
9. and
10. propose
11. a
12. new
13. working
14. method
15. to
16. increase
17. the
18. turnover
19. rate
20. of
21. the
22. ready
23. stock
24. in
25. Zwolle
26. This
27. led
28. to
29. questions
30. about
31. how
32. the
33. outbound
34. logistics
35. is
36. planned
37. in
38. Zwolle
39. today
40. and
41. how
42. it
43. can
44. be
45. planned
46. in
47. the
48. future
49. with
50. increased
51. production
52. volumes
53. The
54. study
55. was
56. limited
57. to
58. cover
59. chassis
60. for
61. direct
62. delivery
63. markets
64. in
65. Europe
66. First
67. to
68. get
69. a
70. holistic
71. overview
72. of
73. the
74. conditions
75. a
76. mapping
77. of
78. the
79. current
80. situation
81. was
82. conducted

Total words: 82

Next, we'll count the number of sentences:
1. The purpose of this study was to investigate and propose a new working method to increase the turnover rate of the ready stock in Zwolle.
2. This led to questions about how the outbound logistics is planned in Zwolle today, and how it can be planned in the future with increased production volumes.
3. The study was limited to cover chassis for direct delivery markets in Europe.
4. First to get a holistic overview of the conditions, a mapping of the current situation was conducted.

Total sentences: 4

Now, let's count the words longer than 6 letters:
1. investigate
2. propose
3. working
4. method
5. increase
6. turnover
7. Zwolle
8. logistics
9. planned
10. volumes
11. product
   (no match in text)
12. conditions
13. mapping 
14. situation
15. holistic 
16. delivery
17. markets 
18. Europe 
   (no Europe has 6 letters, skip)
19. (others present themselves, and should not be counted as there has been an initial filtering in this case already)

However, lets recount the longer words in the text accurately by line:
 investigate, propose, working, increase, turnover, logistics, planned, volumes, production (not in the list above, do add), conditions, mapping, situation, holistic and delivery. Remove Zwolle. The total words longer than 6 letters is 13.  

Now let's calculate the LIX score: 
(number of words)/(number of sentences) = 82 / 4 = 20.5
(number of words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (number of words) = 13 * 100 / 82 ≈ 15.85
LIX = 20.5 + 15.85 ≈ 36.35 

LIX= 36.35
