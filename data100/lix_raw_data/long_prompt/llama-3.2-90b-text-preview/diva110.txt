To calculate the LIX score, we need to break down the text into words and sentences, and count the number of words longer than 6 letters.

1. Break down the text into words: 
The, suggested, solution, uses, a, translation, layer, called, Metadata, FTL, (MFTL), where, file, system, metadata, and, userdata, are, separated, from, each, other, in, order, to, improve, performance. 
The, partition, holding, userdata, uses, a, block-level, mapped, translation, layer, system, called, Fully, Associative, Sector, Translation, FTL. 
The, other, partition, holding, metadata, will, instead, use, a, page-level, mapped, translation, layer, system, which, also, separates, often, modified, data, from, data, modified, seldom.

2. Count the words:
There are 57 words in the text.

3. Break down the text into sentences:
1. The suggested solution uses a translation layer called Metadata FTL (MFTL), where file system metadata and userdata are separated from each other in order to improve performance.
2. The partition holding userdata uses a block-level mapped translation layer system called Fully Associative Sector Translation FTL.
3. The other partition, holding metadata, will instead use a page-level mapped translation layer system which also separates often modified data from data modified seldom.

There are 3 sentences in the text.

4. Count the number of words longer than 6 letters:
 associated (1), metadata (2), userdata (2), separated (1), improve (1), performance (1), mapped (1), Associative (1), partition (1), modified (2), metadata (1), holding (1), instead (1), translated -none-, fully (1), seldom- (note: seldom has 6 letters, modified has 7 hence I did not count seldom)  

There are 14 words longer than 6 letters. 

5. Calculate the LIX score:
(words / sentences) = 57 / 3 = 19 
(words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (number of words) = (14 * 100) / 57 = 24.56 

LIX = 19 + 24.56 = 43.56
