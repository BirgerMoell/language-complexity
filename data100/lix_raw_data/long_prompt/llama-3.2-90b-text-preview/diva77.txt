To calculate the LIX score, let's break down the text into its components.

1. Number of words: 
In, a, passive, house, the, walls, are, thicker, than, normal, due, to, increased, insulation, which, puts, higher, demands, on, accuracy, and, detail, planning, in, junctions, such, as, those, for, windows, It, also, creates, other, conditions, for, the, expression, of, the, facade, and, will, imply, further, difficulties, when, placing, the, windows, outermost, in, the, wall. 

There are 35 words in the text.

2. Number of sentences: 
1. In a passive house the walls are thicker than normal due to increased insulation, which puts higher demands on accuracy and detail planning in junctions, such as those for windows.
2. It also creates other conditions for the expression of the facade and will imply further difficulties when placing the windows outermost in the wall.

There are 2 sentences in the text.

3. Number of words longer than 6 letters:
 passive, increased, insulation, accuracy, junctions, facade, window, outermost, expression, planning, thicker, normal, placing, difficulties. 

There are 14 words longer than 6 letters in the text.

Now let's use the formula to calculate the LIX score:
First, (number of words)/(number of sentences): 35/2 = 17.5
Second, (number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words): 14*100/35 = 40
Finally, add the two results: 
LIX = 17.5 + 40
LIX = 57.5
