To calculate the LIX score, we will first break down the text into its components.

1. Number of words: 
   Most, of, today's, building, damages, can, be, linked, to, moisture, Moisture, also, plays, a, significant, role, in, health, problems, related, to, indoor, climate, Building, physics, is, despite, this, rarely, discussed, seriously, during, the, building, design, phase, Possible, reasons, include, unclear, responsibilities, short-term, economic, focus, a, fragmentized, building, process, and, lack, of, proper, training, and, competence.

   Total number of words: 47

2. Number of sentences: 
   Sentence 1: Most of today's building damages can be linked to moisture.
   Sentence 2: Moisture also plays a significant role in health problems related to indoor climate.
   Sentence 3: Building physics is despite this rarely discussed seriously during the building design phase.
   Sentence 4: Possible reasons include unclear responsibilities; short-term economic focus; a fragmentized building process; and lack of proper training and competence.

   Total number of sentences: 4

3. Number of words longer than 6 letters:
   damages (7), moisture (7), building (7) - appears three times, significant (10), problems (7), related (7), physics (7), despite (7), discussed (8), fragmentized (11), responsibilities (14), economic (8), training (8), competence (9)

   Total number of words longer than 6 letters: 17

Now, we will calculate the LIX score using these values.

   (Number of words) / (Number of sentences) = (47) / (4) = 11.75

   (Number of words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (Number of words) = (17) * 100 / (47) = 361.7 / 47 ≈ 7.70

   (47) / (4) + 7.70 * 100 * 17 / (47) = 11.75 + 36.17 ≈ 47.92

Since (Number of words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (Number of words) corresponds to the 0.07 part of LIX according to the formula;  to compute this (36.17 +11.75 = 47.92) results in (47.92)/100 *100 which equates to:  LIX = 47.92
