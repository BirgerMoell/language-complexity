To calculate the LIX score, we'll break down the text into its components.

1. Number of words: 
Let's count the words:
1. It 
2. emanates 
3. from 
4. an 
5. EC 
6. directive 
7. in 
8. 2002 
9. The 
10. purpose 
11. of 
12. energy 
13. certification 
14. of 
15. buildings 
16. is 
17. efficiency 
18. in 
19. the 
20. use 
21. of 
22. energy 
23. and 
24. a 
25. reduction 
26. of 
27. emissions 
28. effecting 
29. climate 
30. Buildings 
31. account 
32. for 
33. about 
34. 40% 
35. of 
36. the 
37. total 
38. use 
39. of 
40. energy 
41. in 
42. EU 
43. countries 
44. Rising 
45. costs 
46. of 
47. energy 
48. combined 
49. with 
50. an 
51. increasing 
52. environmental 
53. consciousness 
54. on 
55. the 
56. part 
57. of 
58. building 
59. owners 
60. render 
61. timely 
62. the 
63. law 
64. on 
65. certification 
66. of 
67. buildings 
68. for 
69. energy 
70. efficiency

The text contains 70 words.

2. Number of sentences:
Let's identify the sentences:
1. It emanates from an EC directive in 2002.
2. The purpose of energy certification of buildings is efficiency in the use of energy and a reduction of emissions effecting climate.
3. Buildings account for about 40% of the total use of energy in EU countries.
4. Rising costs of energy, combined with an increasing environmental consciousness on the part of building owners, render timely the law on certification of buildings for energy efficiency.

The text contains 4 sentences.

3. Number of words longer than 6 letters:
Let's identify the words longer than 6 letters:
1. emanates 
2. directive 
3. certification 
4. efficiency 
5. reduction 
6. emissions 
7. effecting 
8. climate 
9. combined 
10. environmental 
11. consciousness 
12. increasing 
13. buildings 
14. efficiency (second occurrence)

However, we should be cautious and not count 'buildings', since it only has 8 letters and we counted 'buildings' as it did appear twice on this list. The final number is 13 because I removed 'buildings'.

The number of words longer than 6 letters is 13.

Now we have all the components. We'll use the formula: 
(number of words) / (number of sentences) + ((number of words longer than 6 letters) * 100) / (number of words)

First, let's calculate the first term:
70 words / 4 sentences = 17.5

Now let's multiply the number of words longer than 6 letters by 100 and divide it by the total number of words:
(13 words * 100) / 70 words = 185.7 / 70
13 * 100 / 70 = 18.57 (rounded to two decimal places)

Then add both terms together:
17.5 + 18.57 â‰ˆ 36.07

The LIX score is approximately 36. However since we are not allowed to write a result like LIX = 36.07 we must round down the result as there are no rules for decimals or if one is allowed to. Then finally:
LIX = 36
