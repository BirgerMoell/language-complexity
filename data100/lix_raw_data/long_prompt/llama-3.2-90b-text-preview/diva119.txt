To calculate the LIX readability score, we need to analyze the given text.

First, let's break the text into individual words:

1. When
2. AM
3. is
4. used
5. as
6. a
7. manufacturing
8. method,
9. there
10. are
11. a
12. number
13. of
14. advantages
15. that
16. follows
17. One
18. of
19. the
20. greatest
21. advantages
22. is
23. the
24. resource
25. efficient
26. manufacturing,
27. with
28. aspect
29. to
30. material
31. efficiency,
32. shortened
33. developing
34. time
35. and
36. a
37. less
38. complex
39. design
40. But,
41. regardless
42. of
43. these,
44. AM
45. is
46. still
47. standing
48. in
49. front
50. of
51. some
52. challenges
53. to
54. further
55. replace
56. the
57. traditional
58. manufacturing
59. methods
60. and
61. gain
62. a
63. larger
64. market
65. share

Now, let's count the words: 
There are 65 words in the given text.

Next, let's break the text into individual sentences:
1. When AM is used as a manufacturing method, there are a number of advantages that follows.
2. One of the greatest advantages is the resource efficient manufacturing, with aspect to material efficiency, shortened developing time and a less complex design.
3. But, regardless of these, AM is still standing in front of some challenges to further replace the traditional manufacturing methods and gain a longer market share.

Now, let's count the sentences: 
There are 3 sentences in the given text.

Finally, let's count the number of words with 6 letters or more. 
We have a total of 23 words with 6 letters or more from the list:
- manufacturing
- advantages
- follows
- greatest
- resource
- efficient
- material
- efficiency
- developing
- complex
- regardless
- standing
- challenges
- traditional
- manufacturing
- designing
- advantages
- efficient
- regardless
- largest 
- efficiency 
We have duplicates in this list and to determine duplicates we look at 'advantages' at numbers 14 & 21 and manufacturing at 7 & 58  also 'efficient' numbers 25 & 26 - by replacing the duplicates and look at remaining text - by duplicating 3 words as in the original list: "efficient" (in order it appears), and leaving  'regardless' and in the given calculation: ( manufacturing is to be counted) one 'efficient',  however when breaking original listing; both 'designing' & 'largest' is not to be used on calculation despite it being listed; as it not appears on text provided though 'efficient' is here duplicating number used to fit final item calculation one time each item from this point is counted.

We have a total of 18 different words with 6 letters or more. ( removing duplicates 'advantages', 'efficient', regardless, designing isn't listed).

Now we'll calculate the LIX readability score:

LIX = ((65)/(3)) + ((18)*100)/(65) 
     = 21.67 + 27.69
     â‰ˆ 49.36

Rounding it to two decimal places we'll get:
LIX=49.36
