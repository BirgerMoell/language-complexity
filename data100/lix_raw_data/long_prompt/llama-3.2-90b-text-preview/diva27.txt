First, I'll break down the text into words and sentences for the calculation:

1. An
2. IPM
3. from
4. International
5. Rectifier
6. has
7. been
8. modified
9. and
10. tested
11. by
12. letting
13. the
14. IPM
15. drive
16. a
17. permanent
18. magnet
19. motor
20. under
21. typical
22. load
23. conditions
24. for
25. a
26. long
27. time
28. The
29. test
30. showed
31. that
32. an
33. IPM
34. is
35. a
36. good
37. alternative
38. for
39. the
40. future
41. when
42. it
43. comes
44. to
45. the
46. matter
47. of
48. efficiency
49. cost
50. and
51. space

Sentence 1: An IPM from International Rectifier has been modified and tested by letting the IPM drive a permanent magnet motor under typical load conditions for a long time.
 Sentence 2: The test showed that an IPM is a good alternative for the future, when it comes to the matter of efficiency, cost and space.

Number of words: 51
Number of sentences: 2

Next, I'll count the number of words longer than 6 letters:
- modified (modified)
- International (International)
- Rectifier (Rectifier)
- permanent (permanent)
- typical (typical)
- conditions (conditions)
- alternative (alternative)
- efficiency (efficiency)

Number of words longer than 6 letters: 8

Now, I'll calculate the LIX score:

LIX = (Number of words) / (Number of sentences) + (Number of words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (Number of words)
= (51) / (2) + (8) * 100 / (51)
= 25.5 + 800 / 51
= 25.5 + 15.686
â‰ˆ 41.186

Rounded to two decimal places.

LIX = 41.19
