To calculate the LIX score, we first need to break down the text into its components:

1. Number of words: The text contains 70 words (some are section titles, but we will count them as words for the LIX calculation).
2. Number of sentences: Since this is not a typical text with paragraphs, we will only consider the "Sedan försökte jag sammanställa det till en relativt kort text." sentence as the actual sentence, as the rest appears to be section headings and numbers, totaling 1 sentence.
3. Number of words longer than 6 letters: We will count the words longer than 6 letters:
    - Innehållsförteckning (14 letters)
    - relativt (8 letters)
    - sammanställa (13 letters)
    - Frågeställningar (15 letters)
    - Datorn (should be 'dator' but datorn, so 7 letters count)
    - Persondatorn (13 letters)
    - Hårddisk (should be 8 letters, since a valid count is excluding diacritical)
    - Moderkort (10 letters)
    - Utbyggnadskort (15 letters)
    - Grafikkort (12 letters)
    - Processor (not on the traditional list of words longer than 6 characters except when word origin isn't English)
    - Totaling 12 words longer than 6 letters.

Now we can calculate the LIX score:
LIX = (70 words) / (1 sentences) + (12 words longer than 6 letters)*100 / (70 words) 
= 70/1 + (12*100)/70
= 70 + 17.14
= 87.14
LIX = 87.14
