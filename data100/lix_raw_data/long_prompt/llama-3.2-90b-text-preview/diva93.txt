To calculate the LIX score, we need to break down the text into its components: words and sentences. 

1. Number of sentences: 
 Sentence 1: 'The area of a building is a feature that can be regulated by a strict local plan (Detaljplan).'
 Sentence 2: 'However, VIP make it possible to reduce the thickness of the building envelope and you can thereby increase the area for selling with increased income as a result.'
 Sentence 3: 'Because of that, it is of interest to examine whether it can be profitable to use VIP in new buildings.'
 Sentence 4: 'To determine whether it is profitable to use VIP in outer walls, this study investigated two main scenarios.'

There are 4 sentences.

2. Number of words: 
To count the words in the text, we will go through each sentence and count the words.
 Sentence 1: 1. The 2. area 3. of 4. a 5. building 6. is 7. a 8. feature 9. that 10. can 11. be 12. regulated 13. by 14. a 15. strict 16. local 17. plan 18. (Detaljplan) 
 (There are 18 words in the first sentence.)
 Sentence 2: 19. However 20. VIP 21. make 22. it 23. possible 24. to 25. reduce 26. the 27. thickness 28. of 29. the 30. building 31. envelope 32. and 33. you 34. can 35. thereby 36. increase 37. the 38. area 39. for 40. selling 41. with 42. increased 43. income 44. as 45. a 46. result 
 (There are 28 words in the second sentence, 18 + 28 = 46 words in total.)
 Sentence 3: 47. Because 48. of 49. that 50. it 51. is 52. of 53. interest 54. to 55. examine 56. whether 57. it 58. can 59. be 60. profitable 61. to 62. use 63. VIP 64. in 65. new 66. buildings 
 (There are 20 words in the third sentence, 46 + 20 = 66 words in total.)
 Sentence 4: 67. To 68. determine 69. whether 70. it 71. is 72. profitable 73. to 74. use 75. VIP 76. in 77. outer 78. walls 79. this 80. study 81. investigated 82. two 83. main 84. scenarios 
 (There are 18 words in the fourth sentence, 66 + 18 = 84 words in total.)

There are 84 words in the text.

3. Number of words longer than 6 letters:
 Sentence 1: regulated (9), feature (7), building (8), Detaljplan (11)
 Sentence 2: possible (8), thickness (9), envelope (8), increased (8), selling (7), thereby (8)
 Sentence 3: because (7), examine (7), interest (8), profitable (10)
 Sentence 4: determine (9), profitable (10), investigated (11), scenarios (9)
 The number of words longer than 6 letters is 17.

Now let's calculate the LIX score using the steps specified in your request:
LIX=(number of words)/(number of sentences)+((number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)) 
LIX=(84/4)+(17*100/84)
LIX=21+(1700/84)
LIX=21+20.2381 
(result was obtained using a calculator for accuracy purposes)


LIX= 41.2381
