However, I need to analyze the text first to identify the individual components required for the LIX score calculation. In this case, the provided text seems to be a list of "Keywords". 

Assuming we treat this as a single sentence, I'm going to break down each keyword and analyze them as individual words, along with treating the entire list as a single sentence.

- Number of words: 1. initial, 2. study, 3. object, 4. description, 5. measures, 6. climate, 7. shell, 8. caution, 9. energy, 10. moisture, 11. “pay-back, 12. times”.

There are 12 words in the text.

- Number of sentences: There is only 1 sentence in the text.

- Number of words longer than 6 letters: 1. initial (not longer than 6), 2. study (not longer than 6), 3. object (not longer than 6), 4. description (longer than 6), 5. measures (longer than 6), 6. climate (longer than 6), 7. shell (not longer than 6), 8. caution (not longer than 6), 9. energy (longer than 6), 10. moisture (longer than 6), 11. “pay-back” (longer than 6), 12. times (not longer than 6).

There are 6 words longer than 6 letters.

Now, calculate the LIX score:
(12 words / 1 sentence) + (6 words * 100 / 12 words) = 
12 + (600 / 12) = 12 + 50 = 62.

LIX= 62
