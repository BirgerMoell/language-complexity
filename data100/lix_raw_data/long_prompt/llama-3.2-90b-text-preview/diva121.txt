To calculate the LIX score, I will analyze the given text. 

First, we need to count the number of words. However, the given text is in English, not Swedish. Let's proceed with the calculation.

Here's the word count:
1. The
2. more
3. I
4. learn
5. about
6. this
7. city
8. the
9. more
10. fascinated
11. I
12. get
13. Even
14. though
15. it's
16. young
17. it
18. has
19. already
20. transformed
21. itself
22. multiple
23. times
24. and
25. survived
26. both
27. super
28. expansive
29. growth
30. and
31. fire
32. and
33. depression
34. But
35. it
36. is
37. also
38. a
39. city
40. where
41. the
42. different
43. eras
44. have
45. put
46. its
47. mark
48. and
49. you
50. can
51. clearly
52. read
53. the
54. layers
55. of
56. development
57. But
58. I'm
59. afraid
60. that
61. some
62. things
63. will
64. get
65. lost
66. some
67. of
68. the
69. things
70. that
71. make
72. Seattle
73. special

There are 73 words in the text.

Next, we need to count the number of sentences. There are 4 sentences in the text.

Now, we need to count the number of words longer than 6 letters:
1. fascinated
2. transformed
3. multiple
4. expansive
5. depression
6. different
7. development
8. clearly
9. multiple
10. special

There are 10 words longer than 6 letters.

Now, we can calculate the LIX score:
LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
LIX = (73/4) + (10*100)/73
LIX = 18.25 + 13.70
LIX = 31.95

So, the LIX score for the given text is 31.95.

LIX = 31.95
