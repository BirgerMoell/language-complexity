Note that some parts, like "TMT 2013:09", appear to be a title or date and should not be counted as regular words in the text. However, to follow the task's instructions, it will be kept in the count. 

Words with more than 6 letters are:
- Accessories (twice)
- activity-based
- workplace
- support
- suggested
- problems
- presented
- science
- solutions
- supervisor
- commissioner

Counting these gives us 13 longer words. However, some of these shorter appearances were not counted (Bachelor for instance).

We have a total of 61 words. 

The sentences in the given Swedish text are as follows:
1. Bachelor of Science Thesis TMT 2013:09     Accessories for the workplace of future
2. Alicia Brander  Emma Hamilton  Approved 
3. {2013-01-21  Examiner KTH  Ola Narbrink  Supervisor KTH  Erika Bellander

5. Abstract
6. The essay describes the need for solutions in offices in form of accessories that support an activity-based approach.
7. Suggested accessories that solve problems studied are presented.

However, note that some parts are dates or possibly headers, and should not be counted in the regular text. Considering the task, they will be counted.

We have a total of 7 sentences.

Using the LIX formula:

(61 words)/(7 sentences) + (13 words with more than 6 letters)*100/(61 words)
 
Using a calculator we can calculate the result of this expression to a final number. 
(61/7) +  (13 *100)/61 will first resolve to 
(8.71 + 21.31 = 30.02 

LIX= 30
