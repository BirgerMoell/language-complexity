To analyze the text, I first need the actual Swedish text. The word "Paragraph" is not sufficient for this task. Please provide the full text you'd like me to analyze.

If you provide the text, I'll be able to:

1. Calculate the number of words in the text.
2. Determine the number of sentences in the text.
3. Identify the number of words longer than 6 letters in the text.
4. Plug these values into the LIX formula: (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words).

Then I'll provide you with the result in the requested format, 'LIX=' followed by the score.
