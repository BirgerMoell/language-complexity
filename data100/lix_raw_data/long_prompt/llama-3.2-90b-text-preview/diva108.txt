To calculate the LIX readability score, I will follow these steps:

1. Count the number of words: 
The text contains 76 words.

2. Count the number of sentences: 
The text contains 3 sentences.

3. Count the number of words longer than 6 letters: 
There are 36 words longer than 6 letters in the text.

Now, I will compute the LIX score:

(Number of words) / (number of sentences) = 76 / 3 ≈ 25.33
(Number of words longer than 6 letters) * 100 / (number of words) = 36 * 100 / 76 ≈ 47.37
LIX score = 25.33 + 47.37 ≈ 72.70

LIX = 73 (rounded to the nearest whole number)
