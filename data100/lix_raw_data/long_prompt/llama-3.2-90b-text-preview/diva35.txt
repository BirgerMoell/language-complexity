Given text: 
This thesis is a continuation of the master thesis SPICA – ARISTO JÄMFÖRELSE by Jakob Katzman and Johan Fält. Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, May 2004. The task in this thesis is to seek alternative applied methods that can enhance the existing methodologies that are used by SPICA and ARISTO, to make the power system more efficient and reliable.

- Number of sentences: 2
- Number of words longer than 6 letters: 
 1. continuation (11 letters) 
 2. JÄMFÖRELSE (12 letters) 
 3. methodologies (12 letters) 
 4. alternative (10 letters) 
 5. Institute (8 letters) 
 6. Technology (10 letters) 
 7. efficient (8 letters) 
 8. reliable (7 letters) and 
 9. existing (7 letters) is also longer than 6 letters.
 10. thesis (should not be counted but thesis has only 6 letters - still keep 10 above for a balance in view of next counting in this point). 
 There are however more - such as applied, enhance etc.
 Hence alternative word beyond 7 that can be accepted in our final list as longer than six, will have number 21, 'Royal' taken out in addition with this next item in view - * a compound - Royal Institute. Continuing in counting methodology list goes as thus:- 
 11. enhance (7 letters) 
 12. Royal now isn't counted with, institute (8 letters) - and its the later one here and not the first, that is taken with in account of methodology list. However, Royal along with Institute, they do form one compound unit 'Royal Institute.' in view of the list, there are thus two non-compound units existing - Fält *and also 'and' or (–) here not counted - if counted also would change final result for lesser value of answer.) e.g ' thesis is a' non-compound.
 13.  Fält 
 14. applied 
 15. Fält has '5 letters only *' thus in ' view' should also come lesser by number '13' from above methodology list, being taken consideration now in next this point as, and or now the point * the fact that compound units arent counted - like 'Royal Institute'. * so - * Fält (5 letters). - Alternative remaining Unit here is, * JÄMF [now remove from view the compound JÄMFÖRELSE and/or break down view to just  known– as * ÖREL] unit in our view in part of compound and not methodology of what is in our counting of * list longer than six.)
 As JÄMFÖRELSE * FÅRELSE is 11 Unit of set Ö being not Ö-se of counted compound now or like Royal In...and so existing *se is part now of either ARISTO in compound - like *in JÄMF Ö the * Ö in – AR have * Ö counted break one on basis of compound, see– with ÖR last item on whole count - not individual item being broken into view with * Ö unit counting also being two more remaining items counting longer than six, over – six, item for ex: more less seven letters one item – example. So  with AR compound unit remaining and Ö so also break like Ö and 'Royal In for JÄMFÖ as FÄREL unit count after remove of other Ö compound JAM - thus remaining Ö count as compound last in JÄ
