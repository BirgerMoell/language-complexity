To calculate the LIX readability score, we need to count the number of words, the number of sentences, and the number of words longer than 6 letters.

Here's the count:
- Number of words: 76
- Number of sentences: 6
- Number of words longer than 6 letters: 
  - jazzen (7), innehöll (8), arrangerad (10), soloimprovisationen (18), tillskillnad (12), betydelse (9), kändaste (8), tidigare (9), solot (6) count as 7 (it has less than 7 letters and isn't counted) 
  - There are 8 words longer than 6 letters from the 'list' 'count above'. There are 3 other words 'detta', 'från', and 'största', do not have more than 6 letters.  Armstrong actually do have more than 6 letters so 9.
  The 'words per word' needed for below is the number before this explained and solved issue gave: 76 
  hence number of word in Swedish readability LIX are  9.

Now, let's calculate the LIX score:

LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)
LIX = (76/6)+(9*100)/76
LIX = 12.67+13.158
LIX = 26

However as readability cannot accomodate for text with 7 words average hence this swedish given test set fail due "to large amount text"
