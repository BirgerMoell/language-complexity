To calculate the LIX readability score, we need to analyze the given Swedish text. 

First, we need to count the number of words and sentences. The text contains:

* 56 words
* 4 sentences

Now, let's count the number of words longer than 6 letters:
destruktiva (2 times), skämtsamma, sprida (twice), spridas ( not same), sig (4), precis, snabbt (twice), vidare, dator
Counting them gives a total of 9.

Next, we can calculate the LIX readability score using the formula:

(number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)

Substitute the values we found into the formula:

LIX = (56 words)/(4 sentences) + (9 words longer than 6 letters)*100/(56 words)
LIX ≈ 14 + (9 * 100) / 56
LIX ≈ 14 + 900 / 56
LIX ≈ 14 + 16.07
LIX ≈ 30.07

The result is: LIX = 30.07
