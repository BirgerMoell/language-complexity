To calculate the LIX score, I will first break down the text into its individual components.

Number of words:
1. Bilaga
2. 4.5
3. består
4. av
5. en
6. sammanfattning
7. av
8. tabellerna
9. I
10. den
11. har
12. jag
13. endast
14. tagit
15. med
16. totalsumman
17. samt
18. markeringen
19. av
20. de
21. tre
22. högsta
23. talen

There are 23 words.

Number of sentences: 1. There is only one sentence in the text, but it is divided into two parts with a period (.) in the Swedish text. For the sake of LIX calculation, we will consider it as two sentences.

 However, as there actually is only one period in the text it is one sentence but I evaluated the two segments joined by the conjunction "I den"  (in that).
 The original period is indeed marking a short sentence and thus I assume it should be considered as two. Since only the last period really counts in this case, and the first one I suggest we shall "leave" considering the two pieces connected by a small Swedish word for 'in' and compute  sentence number to 2. I thus recalculated below.



Number of words longer than 6 letters: 
1. sammanfattning
2. totalsumman
3. markeringen
There are 3 words longer than 6 letters. However: består also is. There are 4.

Now I will plug the values into the LIX formula:

LIX = (number of words)/(number of sentences) + (number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)

Since I assume here are two "short" joined sentences. Thus computed:
 LIX = (23/2) + (4)*100/23
LIX = 11.5 + 17.39
LIX = 28.89
