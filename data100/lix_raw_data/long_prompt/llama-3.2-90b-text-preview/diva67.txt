However, I need to translate the provided Swedish text into English. But in this case, the given text is in English. 

To calculate the LIX readability score:

1. Number of words (W) in the sentence: 
   The number of experts responsible for different parts of the design should, however, be kept to a minimum.

   1. The
   2. number
   3. of
   4. experts
   5. responsible
   6. for
   7. different
   8. parts
   9. of
   10. the
   11. design
   12. should
   13. however
   14. be
   15. kept
   16. to
   17. a
   18. minimum.

   Number of words (W) = 18

2. Number of sentences (S): The given text has only one sentence. 

   Number of sentences (S) = 1

3. Words longer than 6 letters (L): 
   1. responsible
   2. different
   3. however
   4. minimum
   5. experts
   6. design

   Number of words longer than 6 letters (L) = 6

LIX = W/S + L*100/W
LIX = 18/1 + 6*100/18
LIX = 18 + 33.33
LIX â‰ˆ 51.33

LIX= 51.33
