To calculate the LIX readability score for the given text, we need to count the words, sentences, and words longer than 6 letters.

There are 8 sentences in the text.
1. SmedenSmeden bodde trångt och ofta med stora familjer, uppåt tio barn var vanligt.
   - Let's assume 'SmedenSmeden' is a typo, and we consider it as one word, since 'Smeden' is repeated.
   We will split this text into individual words and count the total number of words in this step and every other step that follows in this text, and use the cumulative number to proceed with our calculation.
  Example for this sentence: There are 11 words: Smeden, bodde, trångt, och, ofta, med, stora, familjer, uppåt, tio, barn

There are 14 words in sentence 2-4 together including 4 words in sentence 2 as:
kök och liten kammare, föräldrarna, sov i varsin säng. 
And 6 in sentence 3 including four new words.
And 4 more for sentence 4.

Combining all the words, we now have 11 + 14, or 25 in the first 4 sentences. The last three sentences yield 
3 + 7 + 6 = 16 new words, bringing our cumulative total to: 25 + 16 or 41 words total in our text. 

Next, we need to calculate the words with more than 6 letters. Using the same split applied in the prior description:
 The expanded seven-word list that is greater than six consists of:
trångt, ofta, stora, familjer, varsin, liknande, trevligaste.
So we have 7 such words.

We also now have to note our full list of sentences as used in this text
So eight of these exist.

Using the given LIX formula:
(number of words)/(number of sentences)+(number of words longer than 6 letters)*100/(number of words)

Plugging in our values:
(41)/(8) + (7)*100/(41)
First partial sum is: 41/8 = 5.125 
and then divide the prior partial sum of prior long-words by total number of words
and multiply prior by (100) and then we get a final answer of 
(5.125) + (7*100/41) = (5.125) + 170.73) / 41 = 5.125 + (4.163415 or 4.16), adding, 9.288.scalablytypedI apologize, here is the correct result:

 LIX= 9.29
