To calculate the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: The text contains 80 words.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as words with more than 6 letters. There are 26 long words in the text.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: The text contains 5 sentences.

The LIX formula is given by:

\[ \text{LIX} = \left( \frac{W}{S} \right) + \left( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \right) \]

Now we can substitute the values we have:
- W = 80
- S = 5
- L = 26

Plugging the values into the formula:

1. Calculate \( \frac{W}{S} = \frac{80}{5} = 16 \)
2. Calculate \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} = \frac{26 \times 100}{80} = 32.5 \)

Now, combine these results:

\[ \text{LIX} = 16 + 32.5 = 48.5 \]

Therefore, the final LIX score is:

LIX=48.5
