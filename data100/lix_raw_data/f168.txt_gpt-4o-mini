To calculate the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we use the following formula:

LIX = (A / O) + (K * 100) / S

where:
- A = the number of characters in the text
- O = the number of long words (words longer than 6 characters)
- K = the number of sentences
- S = the number of words

**Step-by-step Calculation:**

1. **Count the characters (A)**: We count all visible characters, including letters, punctuation, and spaces.
   - For the provided text, A = 485 characters (including spaces).

2. **Count the number of long words (O)**: We identify words longer than 6 characters.
   - The long words in the text are: "egentligen", "grund", "korallrev", "tror", "ligat", "Devon", "milj.", "fiskarna", "tidsperioden", "kallas", "Ormbunkarna", "sandstenar", "skiffer", "kalkstenar" (a total of 13 long words).
   - Thus, O = 13.

3. **Count the number of sentences (K)**: We identify the number of sentences by counting full stops or equivalents.
   - In this text, we have 3 sentences (identified by periods).
   - Thus, K = 3.

4. **Count the number of words (S)**: We simply count the total number of words in the text.
   - The total word count is 97.
   - Thus, S = 97.

**Now, substituting into the LIX formula**:

LIX = (485 / 13) + (3 * 100) / 97

Calculating further:

- 485 / 13 ≈ 37.31
- (3 * 100) / 97 ≈ 9.27

So:

LIX ≈ 37.31 + 9.27 ≈ 46.58

Finally, rounding the LIX score, we get:

LIX = 47

Thus, the result is:

LIX=47
