To calculate the LIX readability score, we'll use the formula developed by the Swedish journal publisher, Svenska Dagblad. 

The LIX score is based on three factors:
1. The average number of words per sentence (long sentences make a text more difficult to read)
2. The proportion of long words (more than six characters) in the text
3. The proportion of very long words (more than seven characters) in the text

However, since the input text is incomplete and mostly consists of a table of contents, the data needed to compute an accurate LIX readability score is missing.

Assuming the text has approximately 70-80 words in total (including 'Innehållsförteckning' entries). I will make an approximate calculation.

1. Average sentence length (S): Count the dots and divide by the total number of words. There are 5 dots and perhaps 10 words not counting the innehållsförteckning sections and assuming some are not on the supplied text: I'm going to use 5 dots and use 70 (an estimate) to derive an average sentence length (5/70)*100 = 7.14. To meet the requirements of the formula we will reverse this to arrive at approximately 14 words on average per sentence.

2. Proportion of long words (W): Count words with seven letters or more. I counted about 5 such words, based on some examples out of 70 total. The long word proportion is therefore (5/70)*100 = 7.14.

3. Proportion of very long words (W2):  The same thing but for words longer than 8 characters, these were several in this list (there were the likes of 'processors and kommunilerar'). If we guess 4 such terms  (4/70)*100 = 5.71

We can plug these numbers into the formula:
LIX = S/W + (W/W2 * 5)  - 2W2
Using the previously estimated figures LIX is: 14 / 7.14 + (7.14 / 5.71) * 5  - 2 * 5.71 
which is: 1.96 + 6.27 -11.42  = 1.98
