To compute the LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: The entire text contains 92 words.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as words that are longer than 6 characters. In the text, we find that there are 20 long words.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: The text has 4 sentences.

The LIX formula is given by:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \frac{L \times 100}{W} \]

Now we can plug in the values:

- \( W = 92 \)
- \( S = 4 \)
- \( L = 20 \)

Calculating the components:

1. \( \frac{W}{S} = \frac{92}{4} = 23 \)
2. \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} = \frac{20 \times 100}{92} \approx 21.74 \)

Now we combine these to calculate the LIX score:

\[ \text{LIX} = 23 + 21.74 \approx 44.74 \]

Thus rounding to two decimal places, the final LIX score is:

LIX=44.74
