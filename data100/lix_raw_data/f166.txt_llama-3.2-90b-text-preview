To calculate the LIX readability score, we use a formula that considers the average number of words per sentence, the percentage of long words (with more than 6 characters), and the percentage of complex words (with more than two syllables or non-standard words).

Let's analyze the Swedish text:
 
1. The text has 5 sentences.
 Sentence lengths: 
   1. 18 words
   2. 14 words
   3. 24 words
   4. 12 words
   5. 17 words
   Average words per sentence = (18 + 14 + 24 + 12 + 17) / 5 = 17.0 

LIX formula uses the number of words per 100 words (17/100 = 0.17 x 100 = 17)

2. Calculate the percentage of long words. We will count words with more than 6 characters as 'long'.
   Long words: 
      beroende
      mangroveskogen 
      filter
      anläggs
      räkodlingar
      mangroveskog
      anlägger
      odla
      räkor
      krävs
      fiskmjöl
      utfiskningen 
      räkorna
      extremt
   Percent of long words = (13 long words / 85 words total) x 100 =  15.29% 

LIX formula uses the exact percentage number.

3. Calculate the percentage of complex words. We will consider words with more than two syllables or non-standard words as 'complex'. 
   Complex words: 
      beroende
      mangroveskogen
      korallreven 
      mangroveskog 
      räkodlingar
      odla
      fiskmjöl
      extremt
   Percent of complex words = (8 complex words / 85 words total) x 100 =  9.41% 

LIX formula uses the exact percentage number.

The LIX formula is:
LIX =  (words per 100 words * .4) + (percent long words * .1) + (percent complex words * 0.4)

Plugging in our numbers:
LIX = (17 * 0.4) + (15.29 * 0.1) + (9.41 * 0.4)
     =  6.8  + 1.529 + 3.764
     = 12.1

Rounded (if required), but in this case exact  
 
LIX = 12.1
