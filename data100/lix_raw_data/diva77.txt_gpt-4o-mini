To compute the LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided text, we follow the formula:

LIX = (Number of words / Number of sentences) + (Number of long words * 100 / Number of words)

We need to identify:
1. The total number of words.
2. The total number of sentences.
3. The number of long words (defined as words with more than 6 letters).

**Text Analysis:**
1. **Total words**: 74
2. **Total sentences**: 4
3. **Long words**: 
   - "passive" (7)
   - "thicker" (7)
   - "insulation" (11)
   - "demands" (7)
   - "accuracy" (8)
   - "planning" (8)
   - "junctions" (9)
   - "conditions" (10)
   - "expression" (10)
   - "further" (7)
   - "difficulties" (12)
   - "placing" (7)
   - "outermost" (9)

   Count of long words = 13

Now we can plug these values into the LIX formula:

**Calculating LIX:**
- Number of words = 74
- Number of sentences = 4
- Number of long words = 13

LIX = (74 / 4) + (13 * 100 / 74)

Calculating each part:
- 74 / 4 = 18.5
- 13 * 100 / 74 = 17.56756756757 (approximately 17.57)

Now adding both results together: 
LIX = 18.5 + 17.57 = 36.07

Rounding to a reasonable decimal precision, we can express the final result as:

LIX = 36.1
