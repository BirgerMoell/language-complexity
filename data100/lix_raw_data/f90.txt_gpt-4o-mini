To compute the LIX readability score, follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: The text provided contains 108 words.
  
2. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: There are 5 sentences in the text.
  
3. **Count the number of long words (L)**: A long word is defined as a word with 6 or more characters. In the text provided, there are 25 long words (e.g., "Övrigt", "Tillslut", "intressant", "huvudpersonen", "fängelse" etc.).

4. **Apply the LIX formula**: The LIX score is calculated using the formula: 
   \[
   LIX = \frac{W}{S} + \left( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \right)
   \]

Now, let's compute the values:
- **W = 108**
- **S = 5**
- **L = 25**

First, calculate \( \frac{W}{S} \):
\[
\frac{W}{S} = \frac{108}{5} = 21.6
\]

Next, calculate \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \):
\[
\frac{L \times 100}{W} = \frac{25 \times 100}{108} \approx 23.1481
\]

Now, sum these two results to obtain the LIX score:
\[
LIX = 21.6 + 23.1481 \approx 44.7481
\]

Finally, we round to the nearest whole number:
\[
\text{LIX} \approx 45
\]

Thus, the final LIX readability score is:
LIX=45
