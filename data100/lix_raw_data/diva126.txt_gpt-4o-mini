To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: The total number of words in the text.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: The number of words with more than 6 letters.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: The total number of sentences in the text.

The formula for LIX is:

\[ \text{LIX} = \left( \frac{W}{S} \right) + \left( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \right) \]

### Step-by-step analysis:
1. **Count the words (W)**:
   - The provided text contains 103 words.

2. **Count the long words (L)**:
   - The long words are: "Metoderna," "skiljer," "grundprincipen," "bygger," "modeller," "utifrån," "given," "digital," "oftast," "arbetet," "behandlat," "området," "första," "tekniskt," "kunskapsmässigt," "ekonomiskt," "perspektiv," "behövt," "analyseras," "kombination," "tillfredställande," "analysera."
   - There are **21** long words.

3. **Count the sentences (S)**:
   - The provided text consists of **2 sentences**.

### Calculation:
- Substituting these counts into the LIX formula:

\[
\text{LIX} = \left( \frac{103}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{21 \times 100}{103} \right)
\]

Calculating step-by-step:
- \( \frac{103}{2} = 51.5 \)
- \( \frac{21 \times 100}{103} \approx 20.3883 \)

Now, summing these results:
\[
\text{LIX} = 51.5 + 20.3883 \approx 71.8883
\]

Rounding to a more conventional score, we get:

LIX = **72** (rounded down to the nearest whole number)

So the final result is:

LIX=72
