To calculate the LIX (Legibility Index) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we use the following formula:

LIX = (A / O) + (S * 100) / A

Where:
- A = the total number of words in the text
- O = the total number of long words (words ≥ 6 letters)
- S = the total number of sentences

Now, let's analyze the text step by step:

1. **Counting Words (A)**: The provided text has a total of 52 words.
2. **Counting Long Words (O)**: The long words (≥6 letters) in the text are:
   - bestämmer 
   - omöjlig
   - situation
   - fångat
   - ensamma
   The total number of long words is 5.
   
3. **Counting Sentences (S)**: The text contains 4 sentences, as it consists of distinct clauses that express a complete thought.

Now we can substitute these values into the LIX formula:

- A = 52 (total words)
- O = 5 (long words)
- S = 4 (sentences)

LIX = (52 / 5) + (4 * 100) / 52  
LIX = 10.4 + 7.6923  
LIX = 18.0923

Rounding to one decimal place, we get the LIX score as approximately 18.1. 

Now, I will present the result concisely:

LIX=18.1
