To analyze the given text and compute the LIX readability score, we need to translate the text into Swedish and then apply the LIX formula, but since the text is not in Swedish, we will use it as it is.


The LIX score (Lasbarhetsindex) is a measure of readability, and it's calculated as follows:
LIX = (A + B + 100 * C) / (number of sentences)

First, let's calculate:
A = number of words divided by number of sentences
B = number of longer words (with more than 6 letters) divided by the total number of words
C = number of words with more than six letters divided by the total number of words

Word count: 1. If  2. the  3. actual  4. energy  5. consumption  6. is  7. significantly  8. below  9. the  10. reference  11. value,  12. we  13. believe  14. that  15. a  16. major,  17. costly  18. investigation  19. is  20. not  21. necessary.  22. ·  23. Identification  24. of  25. systems  26. and  27. processes,  28. this  29. makes  30. it  31. necessary  32. to  33. examine  34. the  35. type  36. of  37. heating  38. system,  39. for  40. comfort  41. cooling,  42. etc.  43. ·  44. Visual  45. inspection  46. /  47. investigation  48. of  49. the  50. building  51. with  52. examination  53. of  54. the  55. status  56. of  57. different  58. parts  59. of  60. the  61. buildings  62. service  63. systems.  64. Check  65. of  66. operating  67. times  68. and  69. set  70. values. 
Total words: 70.

Longer words (with more than 6 letters): 1. significantly, 2. reference, 3. necessary, 4. Identification, 5. processes, 6. necessary, 7. examine, 8. system, 9. inspection, 10. investigation, 11. examination, 12. status, 13. different, 14. buildings, 15. operating.
Number of longer words: 15.

The text is divided into four bullet points (for our purpose, these bullet points can be thought of as one unit each), but is actually three complete sentences, so to determine whether this is to be considered as three or four, we see that it actually is structured partially as a group of enumerated list bullet points, and not individual paragraphs of text, The complete and actual full count for sentence count in structures like this can be confusing and according to basic formula definitions in this special instance are evaluated as (what seems from a full context readability determination): three 
 Sentences count: 3 

Now to apply LIX formula:
A = 70 words / 3 sentences ≈ 23.33, round to 23. 
B = (70 - 15) shorter words / 70 ≈ 0.79 * 100 = 79 
C = 15 longer words / 70 ≈ 0.214


Substitute the values in LIX formula:
LIX = (23.0 * 1) + 79 + (100 * 0.214) ≈ 23 + 79 + 21.40
LIX ≈ 123.40 

LIX = 123
