For calculating the LIX readability score, I'll use the following formula: 

LIX = (A + B) * 100 / C 

Where:
- A = aantal ord med 1-3 stavelser (average number of short words per sentence)
- B = aantal ord med 4 stavelser och däröver (average number of long words per sentence)
- C = antal meningar (average number of characters per 100 words)

Here's how I calculate the components:

1. Calculate A (short words): 
The text contains seven sentences with the short word threshold being set at four letters or less and no more than three syllables.

 Sentence 1: Tack. 
- none words. Adding 1 (this single sentence with no short word)

 Sentence 2-7:
- Sammanfattning - 1 (2 syllables not in short category) 
- var - 1 
- hur - 1
- hälsa - 1 (2 syllables)
- gott - 1 
- liv - 1
arbetare - 2 syllables 
(Considering words such as människa, komplex: since they are 2 syllables and in sentences with no pauses or short word will be neglected.)

thus total number of short words: 
- single sentence 1 = 1
- 7 (Total for Sentence 2-7) since we had 11 words the threshold got 7.

Average number of words, N = 79 in 7 sentences 
= (word per sentence in sample )/ (number of sentences), calculating (w/S), 
  1.111/(7 N)= 112 and 79 = average 11.25 

word per sentence in analyzed Sample B 
 word number was seven 14.14  11.25 being threshold used  56 is used in percentage calculating formula here 
=   79 - 56 giving the A of (7/7).  Here A may be 14 or larger 

it ends up as A equals = 1

2. Calculate B (long words): 
Total sentences: 7. Long words = words with more than 3 syllables or 8 letters in threshold here threshold setting sample count each of seven sentences 

long word count I am taking at 11 words Sammanfattning, utvärdera, kontext, arbetsglädje (for duplicate counted values after assessment)

since the B Formula equals N : B long words  taken equals 11 taken equals average number  for each assessed sentence for value used of 1.571 .

3. Calculate C (average number of characters per 100 words):
First calculate total words and total word characters 
Total words W = 79 
Thus  Total word character may be 
459 = total 
then it results as  as the threshold reached in average number of used value = 5.80
character per word ratio = S equals
total words used equals threshold here 

The formula 
C -> ((459)/ (79)) 
in results is  5.8 (character s average  per word ) 

LIX score equation to applied to above figure 
((A + B) * 100 ) /C value  used equals = A + B 
value here thus equals
 [(1 + 1.57 ) * 100 ] / 5.8  becomes 
 [(2.57) * 100 ] / 5.8 
which gave result that computed 

thus become now following = 44.31*

This has been rounded here 

 LIX = 44
