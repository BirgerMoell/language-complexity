To compute the LIX (Lesbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we first need to analyze the text. However, since the text you provided is in English, I will assume it was intended as a direct sample of a sentence that you would find in a Swedish context. 

First, let's extract the required components for calculating the LIX score:

1. **Number of words (W)**: The total word count of the text.
2. **Number of long words (L)**: Words with more than 6 letters.
3. **Number of sentences (S)**: The total number of sentences in the text.

**Steps to Calculate LIX:**

1. **Count the Words (W)**:
   - The text contains 20 words.

2. **Count Long Words (L)**:
   - Long words in the sentence are: "responsible" (11), "different" (9), "minimum" (7). 
   - So, there are 3 long words.

3. **Count Sentences (S)**:
   - There is 1 sentence in the text. 

**Now we can calculate the LIX score** using the formula:
\[ \text{LIX} = \left( \frac{W}{S} \right) + \left( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \right) \]

Plugging in the counts:
- W = 20
- L = 3
- S = 1

Calculating each part:
- \( \frac{W}{S} = \frac{20}{1} = 20 \)
- \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} = \frac{3 \times 100}{20} = \frac{300}{20} = 15 \)

Now we can combine these:
\[ \text{LIX} = 20 + 15 = 35 \]

Therefore, the calculated LIX score for the provided text is: 

LIX=35
