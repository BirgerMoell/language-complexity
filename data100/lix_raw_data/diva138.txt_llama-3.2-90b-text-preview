To calculate the LIX (LäsbarhetsIndex) score, we will use the following formula:

LIX = (SLW + SL + FL) * 100 / W

Where:
- SLW = Short words percentage (number of words with 1-3 letters / total number of words)
- SL = Short sentences percentage (number of sentences with 1-7 words / total number of sentences)
- FL = Foreign word count percentage (number of words with >2 syllables / total number of words)
- W = average number of words per sentence.

Here's the analysis:
- Total number of words: 1. Den 2. grå 3. markeringen 4. som 5. betyder 6. att 7. det 8. rör 9. sig 10. om 11. en 12. av 13. de 14. tre 15. vanligaste 16. problemen 17. för 18. miljöfaktorer 19. eller 20. besvär 21. symtom 22. finns 23. också 24. med.

- Short words: 7 (1. Den, 4. som, 5. betyder is not short, but others might seem that long on initial investigation 7- at is not such a long word however and I thought 6. actually that "här", would count....)  7. det 10. en 11. av 14. tre 21. som I had assumed did count was actually "sig"  the word left 
Short words: 7
- So, SLW = 7 / 24 * 100 = 29.17 

- Average number of words per sentence: 24 words / 1 sentences = 24 words per sentence
- This 'W' value for all intents will be '24' thus:
W = 24
- Number of words with > 2 syllables: 7 
miljöfaktorer (if using standard method, we discount those not in core Swedish - we would discount:  -    the left over being: betyder - 2 syllables, ing not other however I simply applied >2 without deeper analysis),
vanligaste  (3 syllables - this would be marked) 
 So 4 remain.
 Foreign word percentage percentage will thus not need altering from 7 total number/:
FL = 4 / 24 * 100 = 16.67%

- Short sentence: It is one long sentence, so:
SL = 0

Now we plug the values into the LIX formula:
LIX = (29.17 + 16.67 + 0) * 100 / 24
LIX = 46.84 / 0.24 * 100 = 195.17 / 100 then simplifying yields 
LIX= 61.42
