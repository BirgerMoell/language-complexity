To calculate the LIX (Lesbarhetsindex) score for the provided Swedish text, we need to understand how the LIX score is computed. The formula is:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{\text{number of words}}{\text{number of sentences}} + \frac{\text{long words} \times 100}{\text{number of words}} \]

Where:
- Long words are defined as words with more than 6 letters.
- The number of sentences is the total count of distinct sentences in the text.

Now, let's analyze the provided text step-by-step:

1. **Count the number of words**:
   The given text has 87 words.

2. **Count the number of sentences**:
   There are 3 complete sentences in the provided text.

3. **Count the number of long words** (words containing more than 6 letters):
   We identify the long words:
   - considered (9)
   - businesses (10)
   - sustainable (10)
   - audience (8)
   - environmental (13)
   - procurement (11)
   - education (9)
   - knowledge (9)
   - interests (9)
   - attitudes (8)
   - literature (9)
   Total long words = 11.

Now we plug these numbers into the LIX formula:

- Number of words = 87
- Number of sentences = 3
- Number of long words = 11

Calculating the components of the LIX:

1. **First part of the formula**: 
   \[ \frac{87}{3} = 29 \]

2. **Second part of the formula**:
   \[ \frac{11 \times 100}{87} \approx 12.64 \]

3. **Combine the two parts**:
   \[ \text{LIX} = 29 + 12.64 \approx 41.64 \]

Finally, rounding to the nearest whole number gives us a LIX score of 42.

Therefore, the LIX readability score for the text is:

LIX=42
