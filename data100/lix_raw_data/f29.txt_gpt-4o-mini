To calculate the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: The text contains 91 words.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as words with more than 6 letters. After counting, there are 29 long words in the text.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: The text contains 6 sentences.

Now, we can use the LIX formula to compute the score:

\[
LIX = \frac{W}{S} + \left(\frac{L \times 100}{W}\right)
\]

Substituting the values:

- \( W = 91 \)
- \( L = 29 \)
- \( S = 6 \)

Calculating \( \frac{W}{S} \):

\[
\frac{91}{6} \approx 15.17
\]

Calculating \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \):

\[
\frac{29 \times 100}{91} \approx 31.87
\]

Now, adding these two results together:

\[
LIX \approx 15.17 + 31.87 \approx 47.04
\]

Therefore, the final LIX readability score is:

LIX=47.04
