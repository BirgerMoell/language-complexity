To calculate the LIX score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Count the number of words in the text: 
There are 56 words in the given Swedish text.

2. Count the number of sentences in the text: 
There are 5 sentences in the text.

3. Count the number of long words (words with 6 or more letters) in the text: 
There are 24 long words in the text.

4. Calculate the percentage of long words: 
Percentage of long words = (number of long words / total number of words) * 100
Percentage of long words = (24 / 56) * 100 ≈ 42.86%

5. Calculate the mean sentence length: 
Mean sentence length = total number of words / number of sentences
Mean sentence length = 56 / 5 ≈ 11.2 words

6. Calculate the LIX score using the following formula:
LIX = (Percentage of long words * 1.9) + (Mean sentence length * 0.5)
LIX = (42.86 * 1.9) + (11.2 * 0.5)
LIX ≈ 81.31 + 5.6
LIX ≈ 86.91

Rounding down the LIX score to the nearest whole number:
LIX = 87.
