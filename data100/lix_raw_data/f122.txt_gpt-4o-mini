To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we will follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: We tally all the words present in the text.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as words with more than 6 characters.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: Sentences are typically counted by identifying end punctuation marks, such as periods or question marks.

The LIX formula is:
\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \frac{L \times 100}{W} \]

Now, let's analyze the text.

### Text Analysis

1. **Word Count (W)**:
   - Total number of words in the text: 91

2. **Long Words Count (L)**:
   - Long words (more than 6 characters): 11
   - The long words are: "behöver", "miljökatastrof", "personer", "humanitära", "anklagelse", "livshotande", "behandling", "barnfamiljer", "vistats", "sökande", "vistelsetiden".
  
3. **Sentence Count (S)**:
   - Total number of sentences in the text: 5

### Applying the LIX Formula

Now we can plug the values into the formula:

\[
\text{LIX} = \frac{91}{5} + \frac{11 \times 100}{91}
\]
Calculating each part:

- \( \frac{91}{5} = 18.2 \)
- \( \frac{11 \times 100}{91} = \frac{1100}{91} \approx 12.09 \)

Now combine these results:

\[
\text{LIX} = 18.2 + 12.09 = 30.29
\]

Considering rounding, we can present this as:

**LIX=30.3**
