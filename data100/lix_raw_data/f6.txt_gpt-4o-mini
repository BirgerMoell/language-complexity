To compute the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score, we use the following formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{\text{(antal ord)}}{\text{(antal meningar)}} + \frac{\text{(antal långa ord)}}{\text{(antal ord)}} \times 100 \]

Where:
- An "ord" (word) is defined as any sequence of characters separated by spaces.
- A "mening" (sentence) is defined as a sequence of words that ends with a full stop, exclamation mark, or question mark.
- A "långt ord" (long word) is defined as any word that consists of 6 or more characters.

Let's analyze the given text step-by-step:

1. Count the total number of words (antal ord):
   - The text consists of 120 words.

2. Count the total number of sentences (antal meningar):
   - The text contains 5 sentences.

3. Count the long words (antal långa ord):
   - The long words (6 or more characters) in the text are:
     - fascinerad (10)
     - intressanta (11)
     - tidsepoken (10)
     - därför (6)
     - breddare (8)
     - kunskap (8)
     - fortsatta (8)
     - skolåren (8)
   - In total, there are 8 long words.

Now we can plug these values into the LIX formula:

- \( \text{LIX} = \frac{120}{5} + \frac{8}{120} \times 100 \)
- \( \text{LIX} = 24 + \frac{8}{120} \times 100 \)
- \( \text{LIX} = 24 + \frac{800}{120} \)
- \( \text{LIX} = 24 + 6.67 \)
- \( \text{LIX} = 30.67 \)

Finally, we round the LIX score to the nearest whole number.

Thus, the final result is:

LIX=31
