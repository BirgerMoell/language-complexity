To calculate the LIX (Lexical Readability Index) score for the provided Swedish text, we first need to extract some important components:

1. **Number of words (W)**: This includes all the words in the text.
2. **Number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as words with 6 or more letters.
3. **Number of sentences (S)**: This counts the number of sentences in the text.

Next, we use the LIX formula:

\[ 
\text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \left( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \right) 
\]

Here’s the breakdown:

1. **Count the words (W)**: 
   - The text provided contains 92 words.

2. **Count the long words (L)**:
   - Long words (≥ 6 letters): "fascinated," "transformed," "multiple," "expansive," "depression," "different," "development," "Seattle," -> Total = 8 long words.

3. **Count the sentences (S)**:
   - The text consists of 4 sentences.

Now substituting into the LIX formula:

- Calculate \( \frac{W}{S} \): 
  \[ 
  \frac{92}{4} = 23 
  \]

- Calculate \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \): 
  \[ 
  \frac{8 \times 100}{92} \approx 8.70 
  \]

Finally, combine both results to compute LIX:

\[
\text{LIX} = 23 + 8.70 \approx 31.70 
\]

Thus, rounding to one decimal place, we have:

**LIX=31.7**
