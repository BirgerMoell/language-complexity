To calculate the LIX readability score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average number of words per sentence.
2. Calculate the average number of letters per word.
3. Calculate the frequency of long words (words with more than 6 characters).
4. Plug the results into the LIX formula.

Let's calculate the values:
 
1. Average number of words per sentence:
There are 7 sentences in the text. 
Sentence 1 has 10 words, sentence 2 has 15 words, sentence 3 has 1 word, sentence 4 has 1 word, sentence 5 has 1 word, sentence 6 has 1 word, and sentence 7 has 20 words. 
Total words = 10 + 15 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 20 = 49
Average words per sentence = Total words / Total sentences = 49 / 7 ≈ 7

2. Average number of letters per word:
Total letters = 264 (manually counted)
Total words = 49
Average letters per word = Total letters / Total words = 264 / 49 ≈ 5.39

3. Frequency of long words:
There are 26 words with more than 6 characters in the text.
Percentage of long words = (Total long words / Total words) * 100 ≈ (26 / 49) * 100 ≈ 53%

Now, we'll use the LIX formula:

LIX = (Average words per sentence * 0.4) + (Average letters per word * 0.2) + (Percentage of long words * 0.4)

Plugging the results into the formula:

LIX = (7 * 0.4) + (5.39 * 0.2) + (53 * 0.4) 
= 2.8 + 1.078 + 21.2 
≈ 25.078

Rounded to two decimal places, the LIX score is approximately 25.08.

Result: 
LIX=25.08
