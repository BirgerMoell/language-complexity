To calculate the LIX readability score, we need to calculate three values:

1. Average sentence length (ASL) in words
2. Average word length (AWL) in letters
3. Percentage of long words ( PW )
 
From the provided Swedish text:

 Number of words: 55
 Number of sentences: 4
 Long words (> 6 letters) : 18
 Number of letters: 256 words + punctuation = 256 letters / 55 words ≈ 4.65 letters / word.

Now calculate the average values:
 
 Sentence length per 100 words: Since the text has 4 sentences with 55 words: 
 ( 4 / 55 ) * 100 ≈ 7.27 sentences per 100 words.
 Then take the reciprocal value to get the average sentence length (ASL): 
 1 / 0.0727 ≈ 13.76 words per sentence.
 
 Average word length (AWL): (256 letters) / (55 words) = 4.65 letters

 Percentage of long words (PW):
 There are 18 words with more than six letters: (18 / 55) * 100 ≈ 32.73%

 Plug these values into the LIX formula:
 LIX = (ASL + AWL + PW) * 0.01

LIX = (13.76 + 4.65 + 32.73) * 0.01
First: sum (13.76 + 4.65 + 32.73) = 51.14
Final step multiply by 0.01
51.14 * 0.01 = 5.11
