The LIX readability score is a commonly used measure to assess the ease of reading a text. The formula for calculating LIX is as follows:

1. Word count (WC): count the total number of words in the text.
2. Sentence length (SL): calculate the average number of words in each sentence by dividing the total word count by the total number of sentences.
3. Syllable count (SC): count the total number of syllables in the text. 
4. Calculate LIX using the formula: LIX = WC * SL * SC / 100 - WC * 0.4

However, the 'complicated' LIX calculator formula often used instead, is a simplified one. Our results will agree more readily with established baselines if we use that. We calculate or determine the parameters; Word, syllable,  sentence and long word (long words have  more than 6 letters),  counts. Then enter the below to find a LIX score.

 LIX = word count / sentence count + word count / 100 * (long word count / word count)
