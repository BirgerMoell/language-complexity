To calculate the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) score, we need to know two variables: the average word length in letters and the average sentence length in words.

1. Calculate the average word length:
Count the total number of letters in the text and divide by the total number of words. 

After counting the letters, we get:
 Total letters: 446 
 Total words: 71 

Average word length = Total letters / Total words = 446 / 71 ≈ 6.28 letters per word.

2. Calculate the average sentence length:
Count the total number of words in the text and divide by the total number of sentences.

There are 6 sentences.
 Total words: 71 
Average sentence length = Total words / Total sentences = 71 / 6 ≈ 11.83 words per sentence.

To compute the LIX score:
LIX = (Average word length x 0.4) + (Average sentence length x 0.2)

Using a calculator:
LIX ≈ (6.28 * 0.4) + (11.83 * 0.2)
LIX ≈ 2.512 + 2.366
LIX ≈ 4.878

LIX= 4.878
