To calculate the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: This includes all words in the text. 
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as words with more than 6 characters.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: Sentences are typically counted based on punctuation marks such as periods, question marks, and exclamation marks.

Let's analyze the given text:

1. **Total words (W)**: 92
2. **Total sentences (S)**: 5
3. **Total long words (L)**: 17

Now we can use the LIX formula:

\[
\text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \left(\frac{L \times 100}{W}\right)
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
\text{LIX} = \frac{92}{5} + \left(\frac{17 \times 100}{92}\right)
\]

Calculating each part:

\[
\frac{92}{5} = 18.4
\]

For the second term:

\[
\frac{17 \times 100}{92} \approx 18.48 \text{ (rounded)}
\]

Finally, summing these results gives:

\[
\text{LIX} = 18.4 + 18.48 \approx 36.88
\]

Rounding this to the nearest whole number, we have:

**LIX = 37**
