To calculate the LIX (Legibility Index) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: The text consists of a total of 119 words.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as words with more than 6 letters. In the provided text, there are 22 long words.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: The text comprises 5 sentences.

The LIX formula is as follows:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \frac{L \times 100}{W} \]

Where:
- \(W\) is the number of words,
- \(S\) is the number of sentences,
- \(L\) is the number of long words.

Now substituting in the values:

- \(W = 119\)
- \(S = 5\)
- \(L = 22\)

Calculating:

1. First, compute \(W/S\):
   \[ \frac{W}{S} = \frac{119}{5} = 23.8 \]

2. Next, compute \(L \times 100 / W\):
   \[ \frac{L \times 100}{W} = \frac{22 \times 100}{119} \approx 18.49 \]

3. Add these two results together:
   \[ \text{LIX} = 23.8 + 18.49 \approx 42.29 \]

Finally, rounding to two decimal places, we get:

LIX=42.29
