To calculate the LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the total number of words (W)**: The text contains 85 words.
2. **Count the total number of sentences (S)**: The text consists of 4 sentences.
3. **Count the total number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as words with more than 6 characters. In the provided text, there are 24 long words.

The LIX formula is:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \left(\frac{L \times 100}{W}\right) \]

Plugging in the values we've counted:

- \( W = 85 \)
- \( S = 4 \)
- \( L = 24 \)

Now, calculate:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{85}{4} + \left(\frac{24 \times 100}{85}\right) \]

Calculating each part:

1. \( \frac{85}{4} = 21.25 \)
2. \( \frac{24 \times 100}{85} = \frac{2400}{85} \approx 28.24 \)

Now combine these values:

\[ \text{LIX} = 21.25 + 28.24 = 49.49 \]

We can round this to the nearest whole number:

\[ \text{LIX} \approx 49 \]

Therefore, the final result is:

LIX=49
