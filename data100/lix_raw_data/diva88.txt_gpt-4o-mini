To calculate the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score, we follow the formula:

LIX = (number of words / number of sentences) + (number of long words × 100 / number of words)

Let's analyze the provided text:

1. **Count the words**: The text contains 85 words.
2. **Count the sentences**: The text has 4 sentences.
3. **Count the long words**: Long words are defined as words having more than 6 characters. In this text, the long words are:
   - miljöanpassad (15)
   - produktutveckling (16)
   - miljöbelastning (14)
   - avkall (6) is not counted (as it has exactly 6)
   - viktiga (6) is also not counted (has exactly 6)
   - funktion (8)
   - efterfrågan (11)
   - lönsamt (8)
   - företag (7)
   
   Total long words = 7.

Now, substituting these values into the LIX formula:

LIX = (85 / 4) + (7 × 100 / 85)

LIX = 21.25 + (700 / 85)

LIX = 21.25 + 8.24

LIX = 29.49

Since LIX is typically rounded to the nearest whole number:

LIX = 29

Thus the result is:

LIX=29
