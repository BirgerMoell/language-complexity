To calculate the LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the Number of Words (N)**:
   - The total number of words in the text is 107.

2. **Count the Number of Sentences (S)**:
   - The number of sentences is 5.

3. **Count the Number of Long Words (L)**:
   - Long words are defined as words with more than 6 letters. In this text, the long words are: "building", "regulated", "thickness", "envelope", "increase", "profitable", "determine", "investigated", "scenarios". There are 9 long words.

4. **Apply the LIX Formula**:
   - The formula for LIX is as follows:
     \[
     \text{LIX} = \frac{N}{S} + \left(\frac{L \times 100}{N}\right)
     \]

   Plugging in our values:
   - \( N = 107 \)
   - \( S = 5 \)
   - \( L = 9 \)

   First, calculate \( \frac{N}{S} \):
   \[
   \frac{N}{S} = \frac{107}{5} = 21.4
   \]

   Next, calculate \( \frac{L \times 100}{N} \):
   \[
   \frac{L \times 100}{N} = \frac{9 \times 100}{107} \approx 8.41
   \]

   Now, combine these two results:
   \[
   \text{LIX} = 21.4 + 8.41 \approx 29.81
   \]

Thus, the final LIX score for the provided text is:

LIX=29.81
