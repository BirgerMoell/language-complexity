To calculate the LIX readability score, we use the following formula: 

LIX = ( (V/S)*100 ) + ( (M/S)*100 / 100 ), 

where:
LIX = readability score,
V = number of vowels in the text (including compound vowels, but excluding y when used as a consonant),
S = number of sentences in the text,
M = number of multisyllable words in the text.

First, calculate V. Count the vowels in the given text (disregarding punctuation and 'y' as a consonant): 

V =  (counting vowels) 214

Next, calculate S, the number of sentences. There are 4 periods or dots marking separate sentences in the given Swedish text. However, an unmarked phrase is present ("Fördelar"), but given the surrounding context and common usage in text content at the end of this snippet, we treat "Fördelar" more as an untitled header, instead considering only completed lines of meaningful text like the majority as part of our sentence count.

S = 3

Then, calculate M, the number of multisyllable words. In the text, all words of 3 syllables or more are counted as M.

M =  11 

Lastly, input the values into the formula: 

LIX = ( (214 / 3) * 100 ) + ( (11 / 3) * 100 / 100 ) 
LIX =  (71.333 * 100) + ( (3.67) )
LIX =   7133.33 + 3.67 
Since only two decimal places have an effect on readability in calculation (two whole number followed by three numbers after the decimal in the scoring system leading to more precision beyond three would still result in a two digit answer but increase accuracy (with proper rounding)); multiply and divide by (100) and take only the whole part for actual readability, accuracy past after whole number for a written solution found in precision first with all numbers of said final calculation or  two values summed afterwards past the two whole numbers no extra values kept

LIX =  7137
