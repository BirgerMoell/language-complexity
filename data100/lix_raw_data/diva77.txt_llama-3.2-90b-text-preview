To calculate the LIX readability score, I need to count the following components in the given Swedish text (which I assume to be written in English, due to the original request): 

- The number of words 
- The number of long words (more than 6 characters)
- The number of sentences

Counting these components in the given text:
- The number of words: 35
- The number of long words: 14 (increased, insulation, accuracy, demands, detail, planning, junctions, windows, expression, facade, difficulties, outermost)
- The number of sentences: 3

With these values, I can use the following LIX formula to compute the readability score:
- LIX = (Average number of words per sentence) + (Pct of long words * 100) - (Average number of sentences per 100 words)
- or LIX = (Words/ Sentences) + (Long words ratio * 100) - (Sent word ratio * 100)
- or LIX = (Words/ Sentences) +  (Long words words count/ Total words count )  * 100 -  (  (100 * Sentences) / Total words count)

Putting the values into the formula:

LIX = (35 / 3)  +  (14 /  ( 35)) * 100  - (3 * 100 / 35)

Calculating these values using a calculator 
- Average words per sentence = 35 / 3 = 11.67
- Long word ratio  = 14 / 35 * 100 = 40
- 100 * sentences / words count = (3 * 100) / 35 =  8.57
Now combining the formula values LIX = 11.67 + 40 - 8.57 
Using the calculator, this is  43.1

LIX = 43.1
