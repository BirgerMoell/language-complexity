To calculate the LIX readability score, you can follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: In the provided text, there are 76 words.

2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as words with 6 or more characters. The long words in the text are: "största," "delen," "fastlandsklimat," "betydar," "vintrar," "varma," "anledningen," "relativt," "vart," "klimat," "jämför," "bredgrad," "beror," "Golfströmmen," "vattnet," "kommer," "värmer," "upp," "större," "delen," "mycket," "varmare," "Nigeria," "årstid," and "Sverige." There are a total of 24 long words.

3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: The text contains 5 sentences.

Now, we can apply the LIX formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \left( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \right) \]

Substituting the values we have:

- \( W = 76 \)
- \( S = 5 \)
- \( L = 24 \)

Calculating:

- \( \frac{W}{S} = \frac{76}{5} = 15.2 \)
- \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} = \frac{24 \times 100}{76} \approx 31.58 \)

Now, adding those together:

\[ \text{LIX} = 15.2 + 31.58 = 46.78 \]

Rounding the score, we get:

LIX = 47
