To calculate the LIX readability score, we need to perform the following steps:

1. Calculate the number of long words (words with 7 letters or more): 
   In the given text, there are 24 words that meet this criterion.

2. Calculate the average number of words per sentence: 
   There are 56 words and 3 sentences in the text, so the average number of words per sentence is 56 / 3 ≈ 18.67. 

3. Calculate the average number of syllables per word: 
   First, we need to count the total number of syllables in all the words in the text. However, due to the limited tools available in this format and for simplicity, I have approximated this number by analyzing some of the words. There are around 77 words, and approximating (a bit conservatively), we get around 14.22 syllables per 10 words. (this can vary,  this is just an approximation)  Therefore the average number of syllables per word ≈ (56 * 1.42)= 79.52. Now dividing with the total word count in the text, 56 we get 79.52 / 56 ≈ 1.42.

4. Now calculate the LIX: 
   The LIX is calculated as LIX =  (long_words / total_words) * 100 + average_syllables_per_word * (average_words_per_sentence / 100)

   LIX ≈  (24 / 56) * 100 + 1.42 * (18.67 / 100)
   LIX ≈ 0.4286 * 100 + 1.42 * 0.1867
   LIX ≈ 42.86 + 0.265 
   LIX ≈ 43.13


   LIX =  43
