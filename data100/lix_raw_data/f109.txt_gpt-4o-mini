To compute the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score of the provided Swedish text, we follow the standard formula:

LIX = (L / O) + (S * 100 / T)

Where:
- L = the number of words longer than 6 letters
- O = the number of paragraphs
- S = the number of sentences
- T = the total number of words

Let's analyze the text step by step.

### Step 1: Counting the elements

1. **Total Words (T)**: 100
2. **Total Sentences (S)**: 6
3. **Total Paragraphs (O)**: 2
4. **Words longer than 6 letters (L)**:
   - "programmerades" (12)
   - "produced" (8)
   - "matematiska" (11)
   - "militära" (8)
   - "elektronisk" (11)
   
   There are 5 words longer than 6 letters.

### Step 2: Plug numbers into the LIX formula

- L = 5
- O = 2
- S = 6
- T = 100

Now substitute these values into the LIX formula:

LIX = (5 / 2) + (6 * 100 / 100)

LIX = 2.5 + 6

LIX = 8.5

### Result
The calculated LIX readibility score is:

LIX=8.5
