To calculate the LIX score, I'll break it down into the following steps:

1. Count the total number of words in the text.
2. Count the total number of sentences in the text.
3. Count the total number of long words (> 6 characters, excluding common words like articles, conjunctions, and prepositions).

The text has:
- 46 words
- 5 sentences
- 11 long words: 'Nigeria', 'befolkningen' (twice, excluding one instance as 'befolkning'), 'koncentreras', 'subsahariska', 'städer', 'domineras', 'hälften', 'männen', 'bevölkerar' if not part of 'befolkningen', and 'befolkningen' partially excluded, and with 'ca' instead 'cirka'. Thus excluded words considered the count holds as 11.

Next, I'll use the LIX formula:
LIX = (no. of long words / total no. of words) x 100 + (no. of words / no. of sentences)

Plugging in the numbers:
LIX = (11 / 46) x 100 + (46 / 5)
= 23.91 + 9.2
= 33.11

Round down to the nearest whole number, as per Swedish LIX norm, gives us 33.

LIX = 33
