To calculate the LIX readability score, we need to analyze the given Swedish text. However, it seems the text provided is in English, not Swedish. 

LIX readability score is calculated based on two factors: the average number of words per sentence and the average number of complex words per 100 words. Complex words are words with more than 6 letters.

However, this English text is analyzed instead of a Swedish one since none was supplied.

First, let's break the text into words:
1. The
2. measurements
3. to
4. be
5. performed
6. in
7. the
8. attics
9. were
10. air
11. temperature,
12. relative
13. humidity,
14. moisture
15. ratio
16. and
17. air
18. change
19. rate.
20. Since
21. the
22. climate
23. in
24. the
25. attics
26. is
27. dependent
28. on
29. the
30. outdoor
31. climate,
32. it
33. was
34. decided
35. that
36. outdoor
37. climate
38. data
39. would
40. be
41. collected
42. as
43. well.
44. Moisture
45. ratios
46. of
47. similar
48. points
49. in
50. the
51. different
52. objects
53. were
54. measured
55. in
56. order
57. to
58. estimate
59. the
60. cause
61. of
62. these
63. differences.

There are 63 words in the text. 

Next, we'll calculate the number of complex words. Complex words are words with more than 6 letters. Here are the complex words:
- measurements
- performed
- attitude is missing,  attics noted
- temperature
- relative
- humidity
- moisture
- climate
- dependent
- outdoor 
- decided
- collected 
- ratios 
- similar
- different
- measured 
- estimate 
- differences

There are 16 complex words.

Now, we'll calculate the average number of complex words per 100 words. (16/63) * 100 = 25.4 ≈ 25.

We also need to calculate the average number of words per sentence. 
- Sentence 1: 19 words
- Sentence 2: 18 words
- Sentence 3: 14 words

Average number of words per sentence = (19 + 18 + 14) / 3 = 51 / 3 ≈ 17.

We'll now calculate the LIX score. The LIX formula is as follows:

LIX = ( words per sentence * 0.4 ) + ( ( complex words / total words ) * 100 * 0.1 ) * 10 ≈ ( 17 * 0.4 ) + ( 25 * 0.1 ) * 10 
= 6.8 + 25
= 31.8

Unfortunately, only whole numbers will be allowed:

'For' these calculations' rounding 8  down to zero  results in
LIX =  ( (17 * 0.4) +  ( 25 * 0.1 ) *10)  =  8 + 25 = 33
