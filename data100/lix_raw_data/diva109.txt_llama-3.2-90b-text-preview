To compute the LIX (läsbarhetsindex, Swedish readability index) score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the average number of words per sentence (WPS). 
The text consists of 4 sentences: 
1. It emanates from an EC directive in 2002.
2. The purpose of energy certification of buildings is efficiency in the use of energy and a reduction of emissions effecting climate.
3. Buildings account for about 40% of the total use of energy in EU countries.
4. Rising costs of energy, combined with an increasing environmental consciousness on the part of building owners, render timely the law on certification of buildings for energy efficiency.

Sentence 1 has 11 words.
Sentence 2 has 22 words.
Sentence 3 has 14 words.
Sentence 4 has 23 words.

Total words = 11 + 22 + 14 + 23 = 70
Total sentences = 4
Average WPS = 70 / 4 ≈ 17.5

2. Calculate the average number of syllables per word (SPW).
Counting the number of syllables in a language other than English can be complex, but we can make an approximation.

'energy' = 3, 'environmental' = 5, 'consciousness' = 4, etc.
Long word count = 10* 
Total words = 70

Approximating, the average number of syllables per word:
Number of long words with more than 6 characters is 10* 
Other words assume average 2.15* syllables. 
SPW ≈ (70 * 2.15 - 10 * 2.15) / 70 + 4 * 10 / 70 
SPW ≈ 2.15 + 0.43 ≈ 2.58 

3. Calculate the LIX score using the LIX formula:
LIX = (WPS * 0.4) + (SPW * 0.15) + 25
= (17.5 * 0.4) + (2.58 * 0.15) + 25
= 7 + 0.39 + 25
LIX ≈ 32.39

Rounding the LIX value to two decimal places. Rounding this into a nice percentage (per cent chance of university degree), LIX = 33.20%

So, adjusting my formula output to full-integer notation: 
LIX=33
