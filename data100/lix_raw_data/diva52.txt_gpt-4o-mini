To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: Total words in the text.
2. **Count the number of long words (LW)**: Words with more than 6 letters.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: Total sentences in the text.

After analyzing the text, here are the counts:

- Total words (W): 87
- Long words (LW): 24 (for example, "resultat", "visat", "produera", etc.)
- Total sentences (S): 2

Now we can plug these numbers into the LIX formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \frac{LW \times 100}{W} \]

First, calculate \( \frac{W}{S} \):

\[ \frac{87}{2} = 43.5 \]

Next, calculate \( \frac{LW \times 100}{W} \):

\[ \frac{24 \times 100}{87} \approx 27.59 \]

Now, we add both parts together:

\[ \text{LIX} = 43.5 + 27.59 \approx 71.09 \]

Finally, we report the result:

LIX=71.09
