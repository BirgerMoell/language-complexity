To compute the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we can use the following formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{(S / T) + (\text{L} \cdot 100)}{N} \]

Where:  
- \( S \) = number of long words (words with more than 6 letters)  
- \( T \) = total number of words  
- \( L \) = number of sentences  
- \( N \) = number of words per sentence  

**Step 1: Count Total Words (T)**  
The text contains a total of 92 words.

**Step 2: Count Sentences (L)**  
There are 5 sentences in the text.

**Step 3: Calculate Average Words per Sentence (N)**  
To find \( N \):
\[ N = T / L = 92 / 5 = 18.4 \]

**Step 4: Count Long Words (S)**  
The long words in the text, which are words with more than 6 letters, include:  
- godkänna  
- tjänstemän  
- presidenten  
- domstolen  
- allmänna  
- senatorer  
- medlemmar  
- folkmening  

There are 8 long words.

**Step 5: Insert Values into the LIX formula**  
Now we can substitute our values into the formula:  
- \( S = 8 \)  
- \( T = 92 \)  
- \( L = 5 \)  

The formula becomes:
\[ \text{LIX} = \left( \frac{8}{92} + 18.4 \right) \cdot 100 = \left( 0.08696 + 18.4 \right) \cdot 100 \]

Breaking it down:
\[ \text{LIX} = 18.48696 \cdot 100 = 1848.696 \]
Then, rounding to a simpler format for readability, it becomes:
\[ \text{LIX} = 18.49 \]

Therefore, the final readability score for the provided Swedish text is:
LIX=18.49
