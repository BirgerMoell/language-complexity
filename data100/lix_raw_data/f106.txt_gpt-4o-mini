To compute the LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we first need to gather the necessary information about the text:

1. **Number of words (W)**: Count the total number of words in the text.
2. **Number of long words (L)**: Count the number of words that are longer than 6 characters.
3. **Number of sentences (S)**: Count the total number of sentences in the text.

### Step 1: Analyze the text

Analyzing the Swedish text provided:

- **Total words (W)**: 105 words
- **Long words (L)**: 17 long words (words longer than 6 letters)
- **Total sentences (S)**: 5 sentences

### Step 2: Calculate the LIX score

The LIX formula is:

\[
LIX = \frac{W}{S} + \left(\frac{L \times 100}{W}\right)
\]

Where:
- \( W \) = total number of words
- \( S \) = total number of sentences
- \( L \) = number of long words

### Step 3: Substitute the values

Plugging the numbers into the formula:

\[
LIX = \frac{105}{5} + \left(\frac{17 \times 100}{105}\right)
\]

Calculating each component:

1. \( \frac{105}{5} = 21 \)
2. \( \frac{17 \times 100}{105} = \frac{1700}{105} \approx 16.19 \)

Adding these together:

\[
LIX = 21 + 16.19 \approx 37.19
\]

### Result

The LIX readability score for the given Swedish text is:

LIX=37.19
