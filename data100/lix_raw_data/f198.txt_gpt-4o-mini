To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we will follow the LIX formula:

LIX = (A / O) + (G × 100 / S)

Where:
- A = Number of words
- O = Number of long words (more than 6 letters)
- G = Number of groups of words (sentences)
- S = Number of sentences

Let's analyze the given text.

1. Count the number of words (A):
   - Total words: 82

2. Count the number of long words (O):
   - Long words: "missbedömde" (12), "besvikelse" (10), "kungaparet" (10), "försöka" (7), "segla" (6); in total 5 long words.

3. Count the number of sentences (G and S):
   - There are 4 sentences in the text.

Now we can substitute these values into the LIX formula:

- A = 82
- O = 5
- G = 4
- S = 4

Now computing:

LIX = (82 / 5) + (4 × 100 / 4)
LIX = 16.4 + 100
LIX = 116.4

Therefore, the LIX readability score for the text is:

LIX=116.4
