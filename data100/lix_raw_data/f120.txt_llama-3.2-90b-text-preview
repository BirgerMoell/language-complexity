To calculate the LIX readability score, we need to follow these steps: 

1. Count the number of words in the text: 
I counted a total of 56 words in the text.

2. Count the number of periods (.) or sentence endings: 
There are 4 sentences.

3. Count the number of words longer than six letters:
I found 17 words that have more than six letters.

4. Calculate the average number of words per sentence (A):
A = Total number of words / Total number of sentences 
A = 56 / 4 
A = 14

5. Calculate the percentage of long words (B) in the text:
B = Total number of long words / Total number of words
B = 17 / 56 
B = 0.3036 
B *= 100
B = 30.36
Round down to the nearest whole number.
B = 30

6. Now we can calculate the LIX score:
LIX = A + B 
LIX = 14 + 30 
LIX = 44

So the LIX score is:
LIX = 44
