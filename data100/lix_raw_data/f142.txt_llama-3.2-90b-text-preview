To compute the LIX readability score, we will use the following formula: 

LIX = (A + B + C) 

Where:
A = antal ord längre än 6 bokstäver / antal ord x 100 ( percentage of words longer than 6 letters)
B = antal meningar / antal ord x 100 (percentage of sentences per word)
C = antal ord i genomsnitt per mening / antal tecken (mean word length including punctuation)

Now, let's calculate:

Words (antwoord words) - 
Metod (1 word), Min (1), metod (1), ..., Tanzania är (no angola, Tanzania är Not present. We use the full body)
In this piece - 
We have 106 Words. 

We can calculate the amount longer than 6 
Metod (6), Method is correct (Min = 3). For a more realistic value in calculations, full words of our words longer are
fattigaländerna, (10), Sahara (6),  självständigt (12), medSina (12 not present this time,  Stort = 5 has sin(a)), 2,7 (2), 'Sverige' (no) has 7. 'Befolkningstätheten' has 15. 'miljoner' has(8)

In this piece - 
We have 7 Words longer than 6 and 19 words with more than 7 letters (we adjusted the scope slightly for more clarity) to truly represent the complexity presented.

For accurate calculations - 
Words longer than 6 letters / Total words x 100
= 19 / 106 x 100
= 0.179 or 17.9

A = 17.9 for these types calculations with these types of texts

For B, percentages B sentences per word is (to calculate words total sentences are found prior to the computation)
For a result - 
We have 4 sentences and 106 words.   
B = Antal meningar / antal ord x 100
B = 4 / 106 x 100 = 0.038 or 3.8

For C 
-We now 106 words and a total character count for those to the reader 575 . 
C = (antal ord i genomsnitt / antal tecken = 575)
For now:
C= 0.1839 -> we adjust to decimal here i Sverige (due scope is already simplified.) x 100 to reduce fractions and errors.
So C= 18.4 so (Slightly wrong, due final results variation and differences between the various implementation of standards not exactly applied here.)

Therefore for this short Swedish text portion - results calculated in,
LIX = A + B + C then 
= 17.9 + 3.8 + 18.4 
=  39.8
