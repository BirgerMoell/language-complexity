To calculate the LIX readability score, we need to follow these steps:

1. Count the number of words in the text: 106 words.
2. Count the number of short sentences (<= 15 words): There are 8 short sentences.
3. Count the total number of sentences: There are 9 sentences in total.
4. Calculate the average sentence length: Average sentence length = total number of words / total number of sentences = 106 / 9 ≈ 11.78 words/sentence.
5. Count the number of long words (7 or more letters, excluding compounds and hyphenated words): There are 22 long words.

Now, we'll use the LIX formula: 

LIX = ((Words ≥ 7 letters) * 0.45) + ((Average words per sentence) / 15)

We have all the values: 
- (Words ≥ 7 letters) = 22
- (Average words per sentence) = 11.78

Plugging these values into the formula:

LIX = (22 * 0.45) + (11.78 / 15)
LIX ≈ 9.9 + 0.785
LIX ≈ 10.685

Rounding the result to two decimal places, we get:

LIX= 10.69
