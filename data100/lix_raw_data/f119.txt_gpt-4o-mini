To compute the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: The total number of words in the text.
2. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: The total number of sentences in the text, using punctuation marks like periods, exclamation marks, and question marks to identify sentence boundaries.
3. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Long words are defined as words with more than 6 characters.

Once we have these counts, we can use the LIX formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \left(\frac{L \times 100}{W}\right) \]

### Analysis of the text:

1. **Count of Words (W)**:
   - The text contains **111 words**.

2. **Count of Sentences (S)**:
   - The sentences are delineated by periods, and we find **6 sentences** in total.

3. **Count of Long Words (L)**:
   - The long words (more than 6 characters) in the text are: "läromedel", "därför", "nackdelar", "praktiska", "hem sida", "nackdelen", "sökmotor", "kanske", "sidor", "fil er", "Förklaring", "nackdelar".
   - Counting gives us a total of **12 long words**.

### Plugging the values into the LIX formula:

- \( W = 111 \)
- \( S = 6 \)
- \( L = 12 \)

Substituting in the formula:
\[
\text{LIX} = \frac{111}{6} + \left(\frac{12 \times 100}{111}\right)
\]
\[
\text{LIX} = 18.5 + \left(\frac{1200}{111}\right)
\]
\[
\text{LIX} = 18.5 + 10.81 \approx 29.31
\]

### Final Result:
Rounding to two decimal places, we conclude with the calculated LIX score:

**LIX=29.31**
