To calculate the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex or Readability Index) score, we use the following formula:

LIX = (N * A / W) + (N / S)

Where:
- N is the average number of letters per word.
- A is the average number of words per sentence.
- W is the total number of words.
- S is the total number of sentences.

To calculate the LIX score, we need to first calculate N, A, W, and S.

Step 1: Count the total number of words (W).
The text contains approximately 86 words.

Step 2: Count the total number of sentences (S).
The text contains approximately 6 sentences.

Step 3: Calculate the average number of words per sentence (A).
A = W / S ≈ 86 / 6 ≈ 14.33 words per sentence.

Step 4: Calculate the average number of letters per word (N).
Count the total number of letters in the text and divide it by the number of words.

Total number of letters: approximately 437.
Total number of words: 86.
Average number of letters per word (N) = total number of letters / W ≈ 437 / 86 ≈ 5.08 letters per word.

Now, we have all the necessary values to calculate the LIX score:
LIX = (N * A / W) + (N / S)
LIX ≈ (5.08 * 14.33 / 86) + (5.08 / 6)
LIX ≈ (73.13 / 86) + 0.848
LIX ≈ 0.85 + 0.848 ≈ 33.91.

Rounding this number according to the directions " Om LIX = 70 är texten enkel att läsa, 70 - 85: begriplig, 85 - 95: läsbar, 95 - 105: svår, >105 alltför svår", We round down to the closest interval, to get:
LIX= 34
