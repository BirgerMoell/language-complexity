To calculate the LIX readability score for the provided Swedish text, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (W)** in the text.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**, defined as words with more than 6 letters.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)** in the text.

Once we have these counts, we can use the LIX formula:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \left( \frac{L \times 100}{W} \right) \]

### Step 1: Count the Words

The text contains 89 words.

### Step 2: Count the Long Words

The long words in the text are: "ständigt," "ungdomar," "arbete," "nekas," "oftast," "företaget," "anställa," "tyvärr," "nöjda," "timanställda," "deltid," "halv," "fungera," "personer," "näst," "omöjligt," "arbetslös," "huvudtaget," "problem," "nationalekonomin."

In total, there are 20 long words.

### Step 3: Count the Sentences

The text has 4 sentences.

### Calculation

Now we can plug in these values into the LIX formula:

- \( W = 89 \)
- \( L = 20 \)
- \( S = 4 \)

Calculating LIX:

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{89}{4} + \left( \frac{20 \times 100}{89} \right) \]

Calculating each part:

1. \( \frac{89}{4} = 22.25 \)
2. \( \frac{20 \times 100}{89} \approx 22.47 \)

Now combining both parts:

\[ \text{LIX} \approx 22.25 + 22.47 \approx 44.72 \]

Therefore, rounding to a whole number, we get:

**LIX = 45**
