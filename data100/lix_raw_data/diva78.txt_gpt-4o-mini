To compute the LIX (Läsbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow a specific formula based on the number of words, number of long words, and number of sentences. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the calculation:

1. **Count the number of words (W)**: 
   The provided text contains 106 words.

2. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: 
   There are 6 sentences in the text.

3. **Count the number of long words (L)**: 
   Long words are defined as words with more than 6 characters. After counting, we find there are 34 long words.

Now we can use the LIX formula to compute the score:
\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{W}{S} + \frac{L \times 100}{W} \]

Substituting the values:
- W = 106
- S = 6
- L = 34

Calculating each component:
- \( \frac{W}{S} = \frac{106}{6} \approx 17.67 \)
- \( \frac{L \times 100}{W} = \frac{34 \times 100}{106} \approx 32.08 \)

Now, add these two results together:
\[ \text{LIX} = 17.67 + 32.08 \approx 49.75 \]

Thus, rounding to the nearest whole number:
**LIX = 50**.
