To compute the LIX readability score for the given Swedish text, we will follow the LIX formula:

**LIX = (A / O) + (E × 100) / S**

Where:
- A = number of words
- O = number of long words (words with more than 6 characters)
- E = number of sentences
- S = number of characters in the text

Let's analyze the provided text:

1. **Count the number of words (A):**
   The text has 41 words.

2. **Count the number of sentences (E):**
   The text contains 3 sentences.

3. **Count the number of long words (O):**
   The long words in the text are:
   - hängbroar (9)
   -  lintak (6)
   - metoden (7)
   - baseras (7)
   - modellen (7)
   - faktiskt (7)
   - simulerar (9)
   - byggnationen (12)
   - beaktande (8)
   - geometriskt (10)
   - föränderligt (12)
   - ickelinjär (10)

   There are 12 long words.

4. **Count the number of characters (S):**
   The total number of characters (including spaces) is 282.

Now we can plug these values into the LIX formula:

- A = 41
- O = 12
- E = 3
- S = 282

**Now let's compute LIX:**

**LIX = (A / E) + (O × 100 / A)**

Calculating step by step:

1. A / E = 41 / 3 = 13.67 (approximately)
2. O × 100 / A = (12 × 100) / 41 = 292.68 (approximately)

Now combine these results:

LIX = 13.67 + 292.68 = 306.35

Finally, round as appropriate for readability scores:

LIX = 306.35 ≈ 306

Thus, the final result is:

LIX = 306
