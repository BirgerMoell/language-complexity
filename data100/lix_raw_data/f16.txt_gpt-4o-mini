To compute the LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) readability score for the provided Swedish text, we follow these steps:

1. **Count the number of words (N)**: Count the total number of words in the text.
2. **Count the number of long words (L)**: Count the number of words that are 6 characters or longer.
3. **Count the number of sentences (S)**: Count the number of sentences in the text, defined as segments ending with a period, question mark, or exclamation point.

Next, we use the LIX formula: 

\[ \text{LIX} = \frac{N}{S} + \frac{L \times 100}{N} \]

### Step 1: Count Words
The provided text contains 81 words.

### Step 2: Count Long Words
There are 26 long words (6 characters or more).

### Step 3: Count Sentences
The text consists of 5 sentences.

### Calculate the LIX Score
Substituting the counts into the formula:

- N = 81 (total words)
- L = 26 (long words)
- S = 5 (total sentences)

\[ 
\text{LIX} = \frac{81}{5} + \frac{26 \times 100}{81} 
\]

Calculating each part:

1. \( \frac{81}{5} = 16.2 \)
2. \( \frac{26 \times 100}{81} \approx 32.1 \)

Adding these results together:

\[ 
\text{LIX} = 16.2 + 32.1 = 48.3 
\]

The final LIX readability score is:

LIX=48.3
