To calculate the average dependency distance for the sentence "Så de andra länderna i Europa blev nu också intresserade av detta och startade självklart också upp en massa kolonier.", we first need to identify the words (tokens) in the sentence and their dependencies.

Let's break down the dependencies:

1. **Så** (0) → 1
2. **de** (1) → 1
3. **andra** (2) → 1
4. **länderna** (3) → 1
5. **i** (4) → 2
6. **Europa** (5) → 2
7. **blev** (6) → 6
8. **nu** (7) → 1
9. **också** (8) → 5
10. **intresserade** (9) → 3
11. **av** (10) → 2
12. **detta** (11) → 3
13. **och** (12) → 3
14. **startade** (13) → 6
15. **självklart** (14) → 2
16. **också** (15) → 5
17. **upp** (16) → 2
18. **en** (17) → 1
19. **massa** (18) → 1
20. **kolonier** (19) → 1

Now we will calculate the distances:
- Distance from **Så** (0) to its head (1) → 1
- Distance from **de** (1) to its head (1) → 0
- Distance from **andra** (2) to its head (1) → 1
- Distance from **länderna** (3) to its head (1) → 2
- Distance from **i** (4) to its head (5) → 1
- Distance from **Europa** (5) to its head (6) → 1
- Distance from **blev** (6) to its head (6) → 0
- Distance from **nu** (7) to its head (6) → 1
- Distance from **också** (8) to its head (9) → 1
- Distance from **intresserade** (9) to its head (6) → 3
- Distance from **av** (10) to its head (9) → 1
- Distance from **detta** (11) to its head (9) → 2
- Distance from **och** (12) to its head (13) → 1
- Distance from **startade** (13) to its head (13) → 0
- Distance from **självklart** (14) to its head (13) → 1
- Distance from **också** (15) to its head (13) → 2
- Distance from **upp** (16) to its head (17) → 1
- Distance from **en** (17) to its head (19) → 2
- Distance from **massa** (18) to its head (19) → 1
- Distance from **kolonier** (19) to its head (19) → 0

Now we summarize the distances into a list:
1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 0

Next, we count the total distance and the number of dependencies:

Total distance = 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 = 18  
Number of dependencies = 20

Finally, we calculate the average dependency distance:

Average dependency distance = Total distance / Number of dependencies = 18 / 20 = 0.9

Thus, the average dependency distance for the sentence is **0.9**.
