To analyze the Swedish sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we first need to identify the heads and their dependent words. Here’s a breakdown of the dependencies:

1. "Besöker" is the main verb.
2. "du" is the subject of "besöker."
3. "en" is a determiner for "sida."
4. "sida" is the object of "besöker."
5. "om" introduces a prepositional phrase for "sida."
6. "till exempel" modifies "sida."
7. "antivirus" modifies "program."
8. "program" is the object of "om."
9. "kan" is linked to "hända."
10. "det" is the subject of "kan."
11. "hända" is the main verb of the clause.
12. "att" introduces an infinitival clause.
13. "det" (in "det kommer upp") is the subject of "kommer."
14. "kommer" is the main verb and head for "upp" (which is an adverb).
15. "ett" is a determiner for "fönster."
16. "fönster" is the object of "kommer."
17. "som" introduces a relative clause for "fönster."
18. "tipsar" is the main verb of the relative clause.
19. "om" is a preposition that introduces an object of "tipsar."
20. "andra" modifies "program."
21. "program" is the object of "tipsar."

Now we'll assign dependency distances:
- From "du" (1) to "besöker" (0): Distance = 1
- From "en" (2) to "sida" (1): Distance = 1
- From "sida" (2) to "besöker" (0): Distance = 2
- From "till exempel" (4) to "sida" (1): Distance = 3
- From "antivirus" (5) to "program" (3): Distance = 2
- From "program" (5) to "om" (2): Distance = 3
- From "kan" (6) to "hända" (5): Distance = 1
- From "det" (7) to "kan" (6): Distance = 1
- From "att" (8) to "hända" (5): Distance = 3
- From "det" (9) to "kommer" (11): Distance = 2
- From "kommer" (10) to "upp" (11): Distance = 1
- From "ett" (13) to "fönster" (12): Distance = 1
- From "fönster" (12) to "kommer" (10): Distance = 2
- From "som" (14) to "fönster" (12): Distance = 2
- From "tipsar" (15) to "som" (14): Distance = 1
- From "om" (16) to "tipsar" (15): Distance = 1
- From "andra" (17) to "program" (16): Distance = 1
- From "program" (16) to "om" (18): Distance = 2

Now we compile the distances: 
1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 28 total distances.

Now we count the total number of tokens, including punctuation: 
There are 27 tokens in the sentence.

Finally, the average dependency distance is calculated as:
\[
\text{Average Dependency Distance} = \frac{\text{Total Dependency Distance}}{\text{Number of Tokens}} = \frac{28}{27} \approx 1.037
\]

Thus, the average dependency distance for the sentence "Besöker du en sida om till exempel antivirus program kan det hända att det kommer upp ett litet fönster som tipsar om andra antivirus program." is approximately **1.037**.
