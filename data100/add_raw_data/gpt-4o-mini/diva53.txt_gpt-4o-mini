To analyze the Swedish sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we first identify the dependencies and their distances. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Tokenization of the sentence:**
   - Den
   - utvecklade
   - lyftanordningen
   - består
   - av
   - tre
   - moduler
   - ,
   - en
   - ram
   - som
   - fästs
   - i
   - respektive
   - batterienhet
   - i
   - basstationen
   - innan
   - lyftet
   - påbörjas
   - ,
   - en
   - korg
   - som
   - batteriet
   - ligger
   - i
   - under
   - lyftet
   - samt
   - en
   - vagn
   - som
   - batterierna
   - transporteras
   - på
   - fram
   - till
   - telekomstationens
   - batterienhet
   - .

2. **Dependencies and their distances:**
   We assume that:
   - "Den" has a distance of 3 to "utvecklade" (head).
   - "utvecklade" has a distance of 2 to "lyftanordningen" (head).
   - "lyftanordningen" has a distance of 1 to "bestrå" (head).
   - "bestrå" has a distance of 1 to "av" (head).
   - "tre" has a distance of 1 to "moduler" (head).
   - "moduler" has a distance of 2 to "," (punctuation).
   - "en" has a distance of 1 to "ram" (head).
   - "sat" has a distance of 2 to "fästs" (head).
   - "i" has a distance of 2 to "batterienhet" (head).
   - "i" has a distance of 1 to "basstationen" (head).
   - "innan" has a distance of 1 to "lyftet" (head).
   - "påbörjas" has a distance of 1 to "," (punctuation).
   - "en" has a distance of 1 to "korg" (head).
   - "som" has a distance of 1 to "batteriet" (head).
   - "ligger" has a distance of 2 to "i" (head).
   - "under" has a distance of 4 to "lyftet" (head).
   - "samt" has a distance of 2 to "en" (head).
   - "vagn" has a distance of 1 to "som" (head).
   - "transporteras" has a distance of 1 to "batterierna" (head).
   - "på" has a distance of 2 to "fram" (head).
   - "till" has a distance of 1 to "telekomstationens" (head).
   - "batterienhet" also has a distance 2 to "." (punctuation).

3. **Calculating total distance and the number of tokens:**
   Let's calculate the total dependency distance:
   Total distance = 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 44.

   The total number of tokens (including punctuation) = 30.

4. **Calculating the average dependency distance:**
   \[
   \text{Average Dependency Distance} = \frac{\text{Total Dependency Distance}}{\text{Number of Dependencies}} = \frac{44}{30} \approx 1.47.
   \]

**Final Answer:** The average dependency distance for the provided sentence is approximately 1.47.
