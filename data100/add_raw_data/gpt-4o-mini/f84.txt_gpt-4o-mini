To calculate the average dependency distance in the sentence "Vi har dock blivit mer civiliserad och slåss inte lika mycket – men ändå för mycket", we first need to determine the dependency relations and distances for each token to its head.

Here's the breakdown of the dependencies:
1. "Vi" (subject) → "har" (verb): distance = 1
2. "har" → "dock" (adverb): distance = 1
3. "har" → "blivit" (participle): distance = 1
4. "blivit" → "mer" (comparative adverb): distance = 1
5. "blivit" → "civiliserad" (adjective): distance = 1
6. "har" → "och" (conjunction): distance = 1
7. "slåss" (verb) → "inte" (negation): distance = 1
8. "slåss" → "lika" (comparative adverb): distance = 1
9. "slåss" → "mycket" (adverb): distance = 1
10. "–" (hyphen, punctuation) → "men" (conjunction): distance = 1
11. "men" → "ändå" (adverb): distance = 1
12. "men" → "för" (preposition): distance = 1
13. "för" → "mycket" (adverb): distance = 1

Now, we need to sum the total distances and count the number of tokens (excluding the root).
The total distance is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 13.

The number of tokens is 13 as well. 

Now we calculate the average dependency distance:

Average Dependency Distance = Total Distance / Number of Tokens = 13 / 13 = 1. 

Therefore, the average dependency distance of the sentence is 1.
