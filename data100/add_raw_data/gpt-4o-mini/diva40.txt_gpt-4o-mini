To calculate the average dependency distance for the given sentence, we need to identify the dependencies and calculate the distances.

First, let’s break down the sentence:
- **The disadvantage** (subject)
- **is** (copula)
- **that the technique of building with steel studs is often new to carpenters and thus requires more time** (complement clause)

Now, let's analyze the dependencies:
1. "The" depends on "disadvantage" (distance = 1)
2. "disadvantage" depends on "is" (distance = 1)
3. "is" depends on "that" (distance = 1)
4. "that" depends on "technique" (distance = 1)
5. "the" depends on "technique" (distance = 1)
6. "technique" depends on "building" (distance = 1)
7. "building" depends on "studs" (distance = 1)
8. "with" depends on "studs" (distance = 1)
9. "steel" depends on "studs" (distance = 1)
10. "studs" depends on "is" (distance = 2)
11. "is" depends on "new" (distance = 1)
12. "new" depends on "to" (distance = 1)
13. "to" depends on "carpenters" (distance = 1)
14. "carpenters" depends on "requires" (distance = 2)
15. "thus" depends on "requires" (distance = 1)
16. "requires" depends on "more" (distance = 1)
17. "more" depends on "time" (distance = 1)
18. "time"  has no dependents (assumed distance = 1 for the end of the sentence).

Now, let’s sum the distances:
- Total distances: 
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 17

Count the number of tokens (including all words):
- "The disadvantage is that the technique of building with steel studs is often new to carpenters and thus requires more time." (19 tokens)

Now, let's calculate the average dependency distance:
- Average = Total distances / Number of dependencies
- Number of dependencies = 18 (from the breakdown)
- Average dependency distance = 17 / 18 ≈ 0.94

So, the average dependency distance for the sentence is approximately 0.94.
