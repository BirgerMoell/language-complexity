To calculate the average dependency distance for the sentence "Ramar skall tas bort men är praktiska på så sett att man kan dela upp en hemsida utan att behöva ladda om allt hela tiden," we first need to identify the tokens and their respective relationships.

1. **Tokens**: Each word (including punctuation) is counted as a token, resulting in a total of 18 tokens.

2. **Dependencies**: 
   - "Ramar" to "skall" = 1
   - "skall" to "tas" = 1
   - "tas" to "bort" = 1
   - "bort" to "men" = 1
   - "men" to "är" = 1
   - "är" to "praktiska" = 1
   - "praktiska" to "på" = 1
   - "på" to "så" = 1
   - "så" to "sett" = 1
   - "sett" to "att" = 1
   - "att" to "man" = 1
   - "man" to "kan" = 1
   - "kan" to "dela" = 1
   - "dela" to "upp" = 1
   - "upp" to "en" = 1
   - "en" to "hemsida" = 1
   - "hemsida" to "utan" = 1
   - "utan" to "att" = 1
   - "att" to "behöva" = 1
   - "behöva" to "ladda" = 1
   - "ladda" to "om" = 1
   - "om" to "allt" = 1
   - "allt" to "hela" = 1
   - "hela" to "tiden" = 1

3. **Calculating Total Distances**: Each token's distance to its head counts as follows:
   - For every detached or dependent word, we calculate the distance to its head. The overall average is the total of these distances divided by the number of tokens.

4. **Dependency Distance Calculations**:
   - "Ramar" to "skall": 1
   - "skall" to "tas": 1
   - "tas" to "bort": 1
   - "men" to "är": 1
   - "är" to "praktiska": 1
   - "praktiska" to "på": 1
   - "så" to "sett": 1
   - "sett" to "att": 1
   - "att" to "man": 1
   - "man" to "kan": 1
   - "kan" to "dela": 1
   - "dela" to "upp": 1
   - "upp" to "en": 1
   - "en" to "hemsida": 1
   - "hemsida" to "utan": 1
   - "utan" to "att": 1
   - "att" to "behöva": 1
   - "behöva" to "ladda": 1
   - "ladda" to "om": 1
   - "om" to "allt": 1
   - "allt" to "hela": 1
   - "hela" to "tiden": 1

5. **Average Dependency Distance Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Total Dependency Distances} = 1 + 1 + 1 + ... + 1 \text{ (20 instances)} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Average Dependency Distance} = \frac{20}{20} = 1
   \]

Thus, the average dependency distance for the given sentence is **1.0**.
