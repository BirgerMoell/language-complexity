To calculate the average dependency distance for the sentence "Plankalkül hette den första datorns som gjorde i Tyskland den används för inom millitäten," we first identify the dependencies and their distances from their heads. 

Analyzing the sentence, we identify the following head-token pairs and their corresponding distances:

1. "Plankalkül" to "hette": distance = 1
2. "hette" to "den": distance = 1
3. "hette" to "första": distance = 2
4. "datorns" to "första": distance = 1
5. "som" to "datorns": distance = 2
6. "gjorde" to "som": distance = 1
7. "i" to "gjorde": distance = 2
8. "Tyskland" to "i": distance = 1
9. "den" to "används": distance = 2
10. "används" to "för": distance = 1
11. "för" to "inom": distance = 1
12. "millitäten" to "inom": distance = 1

Now we sum the distances:

- Total dependency distance = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 16

Next, we count the number of dependencies, which is 12 in this case.

Finally, we calculate the average dependency distance:

Average dependency distance = Total distance / Number of dependencies
Average dependency distance = 16 / 12 = 1.33

Thus, the average dependency distance for the given Swedish sentence is **1.33**.
