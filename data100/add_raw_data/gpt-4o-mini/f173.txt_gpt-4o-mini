To calculate the average dependency distance for the provided Swedish sentence, we'll analyze the dependencies of the words in the sentence.

The sentence is:
"Då och då gick de fram mot kroken men stötte bort den utan att smaka på masken. Här måste användas list, tänkte jag, och drog ständigt undan blänket var gång en röding närmade sig."

To compute the average dependency distance, we need to determine the distance from each dependent word to its head (governing) word:

1. **Identifying dependencies**:
   - "Då" has a distance of 1 to "gick"
   - "och" has a distance of 2 to "gick"
   - "då" (again) has a distance of 1 to "gick"
   - "de" has a distance of 1 to "gick"
   - "fram" has a distance of 1 to "gick"
   - "mot" has a distance of 1 to "kroken"
   - "men" has a distance of 1 to "stötte"
   - "stötte" has a distance of 1 to "bort"
   - "den" has a distance of 1 to "bort"
   - "utan" has a distance of 1 to "smaka"
   - "att" has a distance of 1 to "smaka"
   - "smaka" has a distance of 1 to "på"
   - "på" has a distance of 1 to "masken"
   - "Här" has a distance of 1 to "måste"
   - "måste" has a distance of 1 to "användas"
   - "list" has a distance of 1 to "användas"
   - "tänkte" has a distance of 1 to "jag"
   - "och" has a distance of 1 to "drog"
   - "ständigt" has a distance of 1 to "undan"
   - "blänket" has a distance of 1 to "undan"
   - "var" has a distance of 1 to "gång"
   - "gång" has a distance of 1 to "en"
   - "en" has a distance of 1 to "röding"
   - "närmade" has a distance of 1 to "sig"

Now, let's sum up the distances:

- Distances = 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 24

Next, we count the number of dependent words (tokens), which is a total of 23.

Finally, we compute the average dependency distance:

Average Dependency Distance = Total Distance / Number of Dependencies = 24 / 23 ≈ 1.04

Thus, the average dependency distance of the given sentence is approximately **1.04**.
