To analyze the sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we first need to identify the dependencies of each word in the sentence and their distances from their heads.

Let's break down the sentence: 

"Possible reasons include unclear responsibilities; short-term economic focus; a fragmentized building process; and lack of proper training and competence."

We can see the main verb "include" takes the subject "reasons", along with several noun phrases that function as complements. Here's a simplified dependency structure:

1. "Possible" (0 → 1): 1
2. "reasons" (1 → 0): 0 (head)
3. "include" (0 → 1): 1 (head)
4. "unclear" (1 → 1): 0
5. "responsibilities" (3 → 3): 0
6. "short-term" (4 → 4): 0
7. "economic" (5 → 5): 0
8. "focus" (6 → 6): 0
9. "a" (7 → 8): 1
10. "fragmentized" (8 → 7): 1
11. "building" (9 → 9): 0
12. "process" (10 → 10): 0
13. "lack" (11 → 11): 0
14. "of" (12 → 13): 1
15. "proper" (13 → 12): 1
16. "training" (14 → 14): 0
17. "and" (15 → 16): 1
18. "competence" (16 → 15): 1

Now let's calculate the total distances:
- Possible (1)
- reasons (0)
- include (0)
- unclear (0)
- responsibilities (0)
- short-term (0)
- economic (0)
- focus (0)
- a (1)
- fragmentized (1)
- building (0)
- process (0)
- lack (0)
- of (1)
- proper (1)
- training (0)
- and (1)
- competence (1)

Adding these distances gives us a total distance of 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6.

Next, we calculate the number of tokens. The sentence has 18 tokens.

Average dependency distance = Total Distance / Number of Tokens = 6 / 18 = 0.33.

So the average dependency distance for the sentence is approximately **0.33**.
