To analyze the sentence "Man trodde att de som hade en tattuering var en buse 'lagförbrytare' men så var det absolut inte," we first identify the dependencies and their distances.

1. **"Man"** to "trodde": distance = 1
2. **"trodde"** to "att": distance = 1
3. **"att"** to "de": distance = 1
4. **"de"** to "som": distance = 1
5. **"som"** to "hade": distance = 1
6. **"hade"** to "en": distance = 1
7. **"en"** to "tattuering": distance = 1
8. **"tattuering"** to "var": distance = 2
9. **"var"** to "en": distance = 1
10. **"en"** to "buse": distance = 1
11. **"buse"** to "lagförbrytare": distance = 1 (considered as a quoting element)
12. **"buse"** to "men": distance = 2
13. **"men"** to "så": distance = 1
14. **"så"** to "var": distance = 1
15. **"var"** to "det": distance = 1
16. **"det"** to "absolut": distance = 1
17. **"absolut"** to "inte": distance = 1

Now, we compute the total dependency distance by adding them up:

Total distances: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 17

Next, we find the number of tokens in the sentence. The sentence has 17 tokens (including punctuation).

Finally, we calculate the average dependency distance:

Average Dependency Distance = Total Distances / Number of Tokens = 17 / 17 = 1.0

Thus, the average dependency distance for the given Swedish sentence is **1.0**.
