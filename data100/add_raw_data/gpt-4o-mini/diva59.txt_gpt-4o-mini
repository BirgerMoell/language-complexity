To calculate the average dependency distance for the given sentence, we first need to identify the dependencies and their distances from the head of the phrase. Here’s the breakdown of the sentence:

1. **Identify the main verb**: The main verb here is "are directed". It functions as the head of the sentence.
2. **Identify the dependencies**: Below are the main tokens and their corresponding head relationships:
   - "Special" → "acknowledgements" (distance = 1)
   - "acknowledgements" → "are directed" (distance = 2)
   - "are" → "directed" (distance = 1)
   - "directed" → "towards" (distance = 1)
   - "towards" → "Cecilia" (distance = 1)
   - "Cecilia" → "Jan" (distance = 1)
   - "Cecilia" → "Joakim" (distance = 1)
   - "Cecilia" → "Niklas" (distance = 1)
   - "Cecilia" → "Susanne" (distance = 1)
   - "for" → "support" (distance = 1)
   - "their" → "support" (distance = 1)
   - "great" → "support" (distance = 1)
   - "when" → "comprehending" (distance = 1)
   - "comprehending" → "problem" (distance = 1)
   - "the" → "problem" (distance = 1)
   - "particular" → "problem" (distance = 1)
   - "we" → "solved" (distance = 1)
   - "together" → "solved" (distance = 1)

3. **Count the distances**: Summing these distances:
   - Total distance = 1 (Special) + 2 (acknowledgements) + 1 (are) + 1 (directed) + 1 (towards) + 1 (Cecilia) + 1 (Jan) + 1 (Joakim) + 1 (Niklas) + 1 (Susanne) + 1 (for) + 1 (their) + 1 (great) + 1 (when) + 1 (comprehending) + 1 (problem) + 1 (the) + 1 (particular) + 1 (we) + 1 (together) = 22.

4. **Count the tokens**: The total number of tokens in the sentence is 25.

5. **Calculate the average dependency distance**: 
   \[
   \text{Average Dependency Distance} = \frac{\text{Total Dependency Distance}}{\text{Total Number of Tokens}} = \frac{22}{25} = 0.88.
   \]

Thus, the average dependency distance for the given sentence is **0.88**.
