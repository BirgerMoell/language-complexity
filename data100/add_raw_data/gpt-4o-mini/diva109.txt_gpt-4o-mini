To analyze the given sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we first need to identify the words (tokens) and their relationships (dependencies). 

The sentence is: 

"Rising costs of energy, combined with an increasing environmental consciousness on the part of building owners, render timely the law on certification of buildings for energy efficiency."

1. Identify the words and their dependencies:
   - "Rising" → modifies "costs"
   - "costs" → head of the noun phrase
   - "of" → introduces prepositional phrase "of energy"
   - "energy" → head of the prepositional phrase
   - "combined" → modifies the main verb "render"
   - "with" → introduces prepositional phrase "with an increasing environmental consciousness"
   - "an" → modifies "consciousness"
   - "increasing" → modifies "consciousness"
   - "environmental" → modifies "consciousness"
   - "consciousness" → head of the prepositional phrase
   - "on" → introduces prepositional phrase "on the part of building owners"
   - "the" → modifies "part"
   - "part" → head of the prepositional phrase
   - "of" → introduces prepositional phrase "of building owners"
   - "building" → modifies "owners"
   - "owners" → head of the prepositional phrase
   - "render" → main verb
   - "timely" → modifies "render"
   - "the" → modifies "law"
   - "law" → subject of the clause
   - "on" → introduces prepositional phrase "on certification of buildings"
   - "certification" → head of the prepositional phrase
   - "of" → introduces prepositional phrase "of buildings"
   - "buildings" → head of the clause
   - "for" → introduces prepositional phrase "for energy efficiency"
   - "energy" → modifies "efficiency"
   - "efficiency" → head of the prepositional phrase

2. List relations and distances:
   - "Rising" → "costs" (distance: 1)
   - "costs" → "render" (distance: 3)
   - "of" → "energy" (distance: 2)
   - "combined" → "render" (distance: 2)
   - "with" → "consciousness" (distance: 3)
   - "an" → "consciousness" (distance: 1)
   - "increasing" → "consciousness" (distance: 1)
   - "environmental" → "consciousness" (distance: 1)
   - "on" → "part" (distance: 1)
   - "the" → "part" (distance: 1)
   - "of" → "owners" (distance: 3)
   - "building" → "owners" (distance: 1)
   - "render" → "the" (distance: 2)
   - "the" → "law" (distance: 1)
   - "on" → "certification" (distance: 2)
   - "of" → "buildings" (distance: 2)
   - "for" → "efficiency" (distance: 3)
   - "energy" → "efficiency" (distance: 1)

3. Total distances and count:
   The total dependency distance is the sum of all distances:
   - Sum = 1 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 30
   
   The total number of tokens = 20

4. Calculate average dependency distance:
   Average = Total distances / Number of tokens = 30 / 20 = 1.5

Therefore, the average dependency distance of the provided Swedish sentence is **1.5**.
