To analyze the given Swedish sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we first need to break down the sentence into its main components and calculate the individual distances from each token to its respective head.

Here’s the provided sentence:  
"The purpose of this study is to design an education called Miljösäkrade inköp from the target audiences’ knowledge, interests and attitudes, together with literature."

1. **Tokens and Heads**:  
   - "The" → "purpose"
   - "purpose" → "is"
   - "of" → "purpose"
   - "this" → "study"
   - "study" → "is"
   - "is" → "design"
   - "to" → "design"
   - "design" → "is"
   - "an" → "education"
   - "education" → "called"
   - "called" → "design"
   - "Miljösäkrade" → "inköp"
   - "inköp" → "called"
   - "from" → "design"
   - "the" → "audiences’"
   - "target" → "audiences’"
   - "audiences’" → "knowledge"
   - "knowledge" → "from"
   - "interests" → "and" (conjunction)
   - "and" → "interests"
   - "attitudes" → "and"
   - "together" → "with"
   - "with" → "literature"
   - "literature" → "together"
   - "," → "and"
   - "." → "is"

2. **Calculating Distances**:  
For each token, calculate its distance to its head:

- "The" to "purpose": 1
- "purpose" to "is": 1
- "of" to "purpose": 1
- "this" to "study": 1
- "study" to "is": 1
- "is" to "design": 1
- "to" to "design": 1
- "design" to "is": 1
- "an" to "education": 1
- "education" to "called": 1
- "called" to "design": 1
- "Miljösäkrade" to "inköp": 1
- "inköp" to "called": 1
- "from" to "design": 1
- "the" to "audiences’": 1
- "target" to "audiences’": 1
- "audiences’" to "knowledge": 1
- "knowledge" to "from": 1
- "interests" to "and": 1
- "and" to "interests": 0
- "attitudes" to "and": 0
- "together" to "with": 1
- "with" to "literature": 1
- "literature" to "together": 1
- "," to "and": 1
- "." to "is": 1

3. **Total Distances**:  
Sum of all distances: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 22

4. **Number of Tokens**:  
Total number of tokens = 25

5. **Average Dependency Distance**:  
Average Dependency Distance = Total Distance / Number of Tokens = 22 / 25 = 0.88

**Final Result**: The average dependency distance for the sentence is 0.88.
