To calculate the average dependency distance for the provided English sentence, we first need to identify the heads of each phrase and the dependency distances of each word from its respective head. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. **Identifying the dependencies**:
   - "Most" -> "laws" (distance = 1)
   - "of" -> "laws" (distance = 1)
   - "the" -> "laws" (distance = 1)
   - "environmental" -> "laws" (distance = 1)
   - "laws" -> "studied" (distance = 1)
   - "that" -> "studied" (distance = 2)
   - "were" -> "studied" (distance = 1)
   - "studied" -> "are" (distance = 1)
   - "parts" -> "are" (distance = 1)
   - "of" -> "parts" (distance = 1)
   - "the" -> "parts" (distance = 1)
   - "legal" -> "framework" (distance = 2)
   - "framework" -> "are" (distance = 1)
   - "which" -> "means" (distance = 2)
   - "means" -> "are" (distance = 1)
   - "that" -> "means" (distance = 2)
   - "no" -> "limits" (distance = 1)
   - "exact" -> "limits" (distance = 1)
   - "limits" -> "given" (distance = 2)
   - "or" -> "guidelines" (distance = 1)
   - "detailed" -> "guidelines" (distance = 1)
   - "guidelines" -> "given" (distance = 2)
   - "are" (head, distance = 0)
   - "given" (head, distance = 0)
   
2. **Calculating the total dependency distance**:
   Each token's distance from its head contributes to the total dependency distance. Adding all distances collected:

   - Total distances: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 31

3. **Count the number of tokens**:
   Total tokens = 21 (including all words and punctuation)

4. **Calculating the average dependency distance**:
   Average Dependency Distance = Total Distance / Number of Tokens = 31 / 21 â‰ˆ 1.476.

Thus, the average dependency distance of the sentence is approximately **1.48**.
