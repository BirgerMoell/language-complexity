To analyze the sentence "Vid midnatten blir allt klart med valet och sedan rapporterar man hur valresultatet ser ut," we first identify the head of each phrase and the distance of each word from its head.

Below is a breakdown of the words, their heads, and their dependency distances:

1. **Vid** (0) - Distance from head "blir" = 2
2. **midnatten** (1) - Distance from head "blir" = 1
3. **blir** (2) - Head is itself = 0
4. **allt** (3) - Distance from head "blir" = 1
5. **klart** (4) - Distance from head "blir" = 1
6. **med** (5) - Distance from head "blir" = 2
7. **valet** (6) - Distance from head "med" = 1
8. **och** (7) - Distance from head "blir" = 2
9. **sedan** (8) - Distance from head "rapporterar" = 2
10. **rapporterar** (9) - Head is itself = 0
11. **man** (10) - Distance from head "rapporterar" = 1
12. **hur** (11) - Distance from head "ser" = 3
13. **valresultatet** (12) - Distance from head "ser" = 2
14. **ser** (13) - Head is itself = 0
15. **ut** (14) - Distance from head "ser" = 1

Now, we calculate the dependency distances:

- For each token: 
  - `Vid`: 2
  - `midnatten`: 1
  - `blir`: 0
  - `allt`: 1
  - `klart`: 1
  - `med`: 2
  - `valet`: 1
  - `och`: 2
  - `sedan`: 2
  - `rapporterar`: 0
  - `man`: 1
  - `hur`: 3
  - `valresultatet`: 2
  - `ser`: 0
  - `ut`: 1

Adding all dependency distances:
2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 0 + 1 = 20 

The total number of tokens in the sentence is 15.

Finally, we calculate the average dependency distance:
Average Dependency Distance = Total Distance / Total Tokens = 20 / 15 = 1.33

Thus, the average dependency distance for the sentence is **1.33**.
