To analyze the given sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we first need to identify the dependency relationships and their distances.

The sentence is:
"Since the climate in the attics is dependent on the outdoor climate, it was decided that outdoor climate data would be collected as well."

1. Identify the tokens and their head dependencies:
   - "Since" (head: "is") → distance = 1
   - "the" (head: "climate") → distance = 1
   - "climate" (head: "is") → distance = 2
   - "in" (head: "climate") → distance = 1
   - "the" (head: "attics") → distance = 1
   - "attics" (head: "in") → distance = 2
   - "is" (head: "is") → distance = 0
   - "dependent" (head: "is") → distance = 1
   - "on" (head: "dependent") → distance = 1
   - "the" (head: "climate") → distance = 1
   - "outdoor" (head: "climate") → distance = 1
   - "climate" (head: "on") → distance = 2
   - "," (punctuation, head: "is") → distance = 1
   - "it" (head: "was") → distance = 1
   - "was" (head: "was") → distance = 0
   - "decided" (head: "was") → distance = 1
   - "that" (head: "decided") → distance = 1
   - "outdoor" (head: "climate") → distance = 1
   - "climate" (head: "data") → distance = 1
   - "data" (head: "collected") → distance = 1
   - "would" (head: "be") → distance = 1
   - "be" (head: "collected") → distance = 1
   - "collected" (head: "decided") → distance = 1
   - "as" (head: "well") → distance = 0
   - "well" (head: "collected") → distance = 1

2. Calculate total dependency distances:
   - Distances: 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1
   - Total distance = 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 21
   - Number of tokens = 24

3. Calculate average dependency distance:
   - Average dependency distance = Total distance / Number of tokens = 21 / 24 ≈ 0.875

Thus, the average dependency distance for the provided sentence is approximately **0.875**.
