To analyze the sentence "2 92 hela omr, 55 st 92 hela omr, 100 st Radhus Del 1 Radhus Lukt i flera lgh 1." and calculate the average dependency distance, we first identify the tokens and their relationships, including the punctuation.

Assuming the following dependency structure (this is a hypothetical example as the actual syntactic structure may vary based on the context):

1. "2" (distance to head, e.g., "omr")
2. "92" (distance to head, e.g., "omr")
3. "hela" (distance to head, e.g., "omr")
4. "omr" (head)
5. "," (punctuation)
6. "55" (distance to head, e.g., "st")
7. "st" (head)
8. "92" (distance to head, e.g., "omr")
9. "hela" (distance to head, e.g., "omr")
10. "omr" (head)
11. "," (punctuation)
12. "100" (distance to head, e.g., "st")
13. "st" (head)
14. "Radhus" (distance to head, e.g., "Del")
15. "Del" (head)
16. "1" (distance to head, e.g., "Radhus")
17. "Radhus" (head)
18. "Lukt" (distance to head, e.g., "i")
19. "i" (head)
20. "flera" (distance to head, e.g., "lgh")
21. "lgh" (head)
22. "1" (distance to head, e.g., "lgh")
23. "." (punctuation)

Next, we calculate the dependency distances for each token to its head:

1. Distance from "2" to "omr": 3
2. Distance from "92" to "omr": 3
3. Distance from "hela" to "omr": 3
4. Distance from "omr" to "omr": 0
5. Distance from "," to "omr": 1
6. Distance from "55" to "st": 2
7. Distance from "st" to "st": 0
8. Distance from "92" to "omr": 2
9. Distance from "hela" to "omr": 3
10. Distance from "omr" to "omr": 0
11. Distance from "," to "omr": 1
12. Distance from "100" to "st": 2
13. Distance from "st" to "st": 0
14. Distance from "Radhus" to "Del": 1
15. Distance from "Del" to "Del": 0
16. Distance from "1" to "Radhus": 1
17. Distance from "Radhus" to "Del": 1
18. Distance from "Lukt" to "i": 0
19. Distance from "i" to "lgh": 1
20. Distance from "flera" to "lgh": 2
21. Distance from "lgh" to "lgh": 0
22. Distance from "1" to "lgh": 1
23. Distance from "." to "lgh": 1

Now, we sum these distances:

Total distance = 3 + 3 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 27

Now, we count the number of tokens (23).

Average dependency distance = Total distance / Number of tokens = 27 / 23 â‰ˆ 1.17

Thus, the average dependency distance for the given sentence is approximately **1.17**.
