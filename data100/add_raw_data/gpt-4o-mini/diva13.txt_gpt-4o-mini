To calculate the average dependency distance for the provided English sentence, we'll first identify the head-dependent relationships and their distances.

1. **Tokenization**: Let's break down the sentence into its tokens:
   - This
   - led
   - to
   - questions
   - about
   - how
   - the
   - outbound
   - logistics
   - is
   - planned
   - in
   - Zwolle
   - today
   - ,
   - and
   - how
   - it
   - can
   - be
   - planned
   - in
   - the
   - future
   - with
   - increased
   - production
   - volumes
   - .

2. **Dependency Relationships**:
   - 'This' (1) → 'led' (0) → distance = 1
   - 'to' (2) → 'led' (0) → distance = 2
   - 'questions' (3) → 'led' (0) → distance = 3
   - 'about' (4) → 'questions' (3) → distance = 1
   - 'how' (5) → 'about' (4) → distance = 1
   - 'the' (6) → 'logistics' (8) → distance = 2
   - 'outbound' (7) → 'logistics' (8) → distance = 1
   - 'logistics' (8) → 'is' (9) → distance = 1
   - 'planned' (9) → 'is' (9) → distance = 0
   - 'in' (10) → 'planned' (9) → distance = 1
   - 'Zwolle' (11) → 'in' (10) → distance = 1
   - 'today' (12) → 'in' (10) → distance = 2
   - ',' (13) → 'led' (0) → distance = 13
   - 'and' (14) → ',' (13) → distance = 1
   - 'how' (15) → 'about' (4) → distance = 11
   - 'it' (16) → 'can' (17) → distance = 1
   - 'can' (17) → 'be' (18) → distance = 1
   - 'be' (18) → 'planned' (19) → distance = 1
   - 'planned' (19) → 'is' (9) → distance = 10
   - 'in' (20) → 'planned' (19) → distance = 1
   - 'the' (21) → 'future' (22) → distance = 1
   - 'future' (22) → 'with' (23) → distance = 1
   - 'with' (23) → 'increased' (24) → distance = 1
   - 'increased' (24) → 'production' (25) → distance = 1
   - 'production' (25) → 'volumes' (26) → distance = 1
   - 'volumes' (26) → '.' (27) → distance = 1
   - '.' (27) → 'led' (0) → distance = 27

3. **Calculating Total Dependency Distances**:
   - Summing the distances: 
   1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 13 + 1 + 11 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 78

4. **Total Number of Dependencies**:
   - Total tokens = 28
   - Number of dependencies = 24 (some tokens do not have dependencies, such as the token "planned" having two dependencies)

5. **Average Dependency Distance**:
   - Average Dependency Distance = Total Dependency Distance / Number of Dependencies = 78 / 24 = 3.25

Thus, the average dependency distance for the sentence is **3.25**.
