To analyze the sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we need to identify the head for each token and measure the distances between each token and their respective heads. 

Here's a breakdown of some tokens in the sentence:

1. **Hon** (1 distance to its head "uttryckte")
2. **uttryckte** (0, as it's the head)
3. **tydligt** (1 distance to its head "uttryckte")
4. **att** (1 distance to its head "uttryckte")
5. **det** (1 distance to its head "hade")
6. **hade** (0, as it's the head)
7. **räckt** (1 distance to its head "hade")
8. **med** (1 distance to its head "räckt")
9. **en** (2 distance to its head "hälsning")
10. **hälsning** (1 distance to its head "med")
11. **ett** (2 distance to its head "SMS")
12. **SMS** (1 distance to its head "med")
13. **en** (2 distance to its head "fråga")
14. **fråga** (1 distance to its head "med")
15. **om** (1 distance to its head "fråga")
16. **att** (1 distance to its head "om")
17. **gå** (1 distance to its head "att")
18. **på** (1 distance to its head "gå")
19. **lunch** (1 distance to its head "på")
20. **tillsammans** (1 distance to its head "gå")
21. **-** (1 distance to its head "hade")
22. **allt** (2 distance to its head "hade")
23. **från** (1 distance to its head "allt")
24. **de** (2 distance to its head "handlingar")
25. **minsta** (1 distance to its head "handlingar")
26. **handlingar** (1 distance to its head "från")
27. **till** (1 distance to its head "handlingar")
28. **de** (2 distance to its head "större")
29. **större** (1 distance to its head "till")
30. **hade** (0, as it's the head)
31. **kunnat** (1 distance to its head "hade")
32. **förändra** (1 distance to its head "hade")
33. **situationen** (1 distance to its head "förändra")
34. **för** (1 distance to its head "situationen")
35. **hennes** (2 distance to its head "dotter")
36. **dotter** (1 distance to its head "för")

Now, we can list the distances for all tokens (excluding the head):

- 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1

Now, let’s count:
- Total distance = 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 40.
- Total number of tokens = 36 (including punctuation).

Thus, the average dependency distance can be calculated as:

**Average Dependency Distance = Total Distance / Number of Tokens = 40 / 36 ≈ 1.11.**

So, the average dependency distance for the sentence is approximately **1.11**.
