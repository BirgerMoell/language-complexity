To calculate the average dependency distance for the given sentence, we first need to identify the head words for each token and the distances from each token to its corresponding head. Below, I'll break down the dependencies based on the structure of the sentence:

Here is the sentence analyzed for its tokens and dependencies (heads in parentheses):

1. In (are)
2. a (house)
3. passive (house)
4. house (are)
5. the (walls)
6. walls (are)
7. are (thicker)
8. thicker (than)
9. than (thicker)
10. normal (than)
11. due (to)
12. to (due)
13. increased (insulation)
14. insulation (due)
15. , (puts)
16. which (puts)
17. puts (demands)
18. higher (demands)
19. demands (on)
20. on (demands)
21. accuracy (on)
22. and (accuracy)
23. detail (and)
24. planning (junctions)
25. in (junctions)
26. junctions (puts)
27. , (junctions)
28. such (as)
29. as (such)
30. those (are)
31. for (windows)
32. windows (junctions)
33. . (puts)

Next, we calculate the distances:

- 'In' to 'are': 3
- 'a' to 'house': 2
- 'passive' to 'house': 2
- 'house' to 'are': 3
- 'the' to 'walls': 1
- 'walls' to 'are': 2
- 'are' to 'thicker': 1
- 'thicker' to 'than': 1
- 'than' to 'thicker': 1
- 'normal' to 'than': 1
- 'due' to 'to': 1
- 'to' to 'due': 1
- 'increased' to 'insulation': 1
- 'insulation' to 'due': 2
- ',' to 'puts': 4
- 'which' to 'puts': 3
- 'puts' to 'demands': 1
- 'higher' to 'demands': 1
- 'demands' to 'on': 1
- 'on' to 'demands': 1
- 'accuracy' to 'on': 2
- 'and' to 'accuracy': 1
- 'detail' to 'and': 1
- 'planning' to 'junctions': 1
- 'in' to 'junctions': 1
- 'junctions' to 'puts': 2
- ',' to 'junctions': 4
- 'such' to 'as': 1
- 'as' to 'such': 1
- 'those' to 'are': 4
- 'for' to 'windows': 1
- 'windows' to 'junctions': 1
- '.' to 'puts': 4

Now we add these distances:

Total distances = 3 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 60

The number of tokens (including punctuation) = 33

Average dependency distance = Total distances / Number of tokens = 60 / 33 â‰ˆ 1.82

Thus, the average dependency distance for the sentence is approximately **1.82**.
