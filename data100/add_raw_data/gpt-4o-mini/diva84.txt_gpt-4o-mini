To calculate the average dependency distance in the given sentence, we first need to identify the tokens and their respective head words. 

Here is a basic analysis of the dependencies in the provided Swedish sentence:

1. "Med" (with) → head: "analyseras" (3)
2. "den" (the) → head: "modellen" (1)
3. "injusterade" (adjusted) → head: "modellen" (1)
4. "modellen" (the model) → head: "analyseras" (2)
5. "analyseras" (is analyzed) → head: null (it's the root, distance 0)
6. "uppträdande" (performing) → head: "krafter" (1)
7. "krafter" (forces) → head: "analyseras" (3)
8. "och" (and) → head: "analyseras" (3)
9. "deformationer" (deformations) → head: "analyseras" (4)
10. "på" (on) → head: "grund" (2)
11. "grund" (basis) → head: "av" (1)
12. "av" (of) → head: "laster" (1)
13. "nyttiga" (useful) → head: "laster" (1)
14. "laster" (loads) → head: "analyseras" (4)
15. "med" (with) → head: "beaktande" (3)
16. "beaktande" (taking into account) → head: "är" (2)
17. "att" (that) → head: "föränderligt" (2)
18. "systemet" (the system) → head: "är" (2)
19. "är" (is) → head: null (0)
20. "geometriskt" (geometrically) → head: "föränderligt" (1)
21. "föränderligt" (variable) → head: "är" (3)
22. "och" (and) → head: "blir" (3)
23. "analysen" (the analysis) → head: "blir" (2)
24. "blir" (becomes) → head: null (0)
25. "därmed" (thus) → head: "blir" (1)
26. "en" (a) → head: "analys" (1)
27. "ickelinjär" (non-linear) → head: "analys" (1)
28. "analys" (analysis) → head: "blir" (2)

Next, we calculate the distances:

- Distance from "Med" to "analyseras": 3
- Distance from "den" to "modellen": 1
- Distance from "injusterade" to "modellen": 1
- Distance from "modellen" to "analyseras": 2
- Distance for "analyseras": 0 (root)
- Distance from "uppträdande" to "krafter": 1
- Distance from "krafter" to "analyseras": 3
- Distance for "och" to "analyseras": 3
- Distance from "deformationer" to "analyseras": 4
- Distance from "på" to "grund": 2
- Distance from "grund" to "av": 1
- Distance from "av" to "laster": 1
- Distance from "nyttiga" to "laster": 1
- Distance from "laster" to "analyseras": 4
- Distance from "med" to "beaktande": 3
- Distance from "beaktande" to "är": 2
- Distance from "att" to "föränderligt": 2
- Distance from "systemet" to "är": 2
- Distance for "är": 0 (root)
- Distance from "geometriskt" to "föränderligt": 1
- Distance from "föränderligt" to "är": 3
- Distance for "och" to "blir": 3
- Distance from "analysen" to "blir": 2
- Distance for "blir": 0 (root)
- Distance from "därmed" to "blir": 1
- Distance from "en" to "analys": 1
- Distance from "ickelinjär" to "analys": 1
- Distance from "analys" to "blir": 2

Now, summing these distances:
3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 =  59

We have 28 tokens in total, excluding the root nodes.

Finally, the average dependency distance is calculated by dividing the total distance by the number of dependencies:

Average Dependency Distance = Total Distance / Number of Tokens = 59 / 28 = 2.11 (approximately).

Thus, the average dependency distance of the given Swedish sentence is approximately **2.11**.
