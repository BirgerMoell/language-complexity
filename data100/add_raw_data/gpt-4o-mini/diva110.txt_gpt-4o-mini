To analyze the sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we first identify the dependency relationships and distances involved. The sentence provided is:

"The suggested solution uses a translation layer called Metadata FTL (MFTL), where file system metadata and userdata are separated from each other in order to improve performance."

Let's break it down:

1. Identify the main verb and its immediate dependencies:
   - "uses" is the main verb.
   - "solution" is the subject of "uses" (distance 1).
   - "suggested" modifies "solution" (distance 1).
   - "layer" is a direct object (distance 2).
   - "called" modifies "layer" (distance 1).
   - "Metadata FTL" is the complement of "called" (distance 2).
   - "(MFTL)" is an explanation or apposition of "Metadata FTL" (distance 1).

2. Analyze the dependent clause introduced by "where":
   - "where" indicates a new clause modifying "layer."
   - "metadata" and "userdata" are the subjects of "are separated" (distance 3).
   - "file system" modifies "metadata" (distance 2).
   - "are" is the main verb of this clause (distance to each subject is 2).
   - "separated" is a predicate, linking "metadata" and "userdata" with their complements (this adds some additional dependencies).

3. "in order to improve performance" indicates a purpose and "improve" is linked back to the main verb—its distance from the main verb (for each structure in context).

Now, calculate each distance:

- **Distances from "uses":**
  - "suggested" → "uses": 1
  - "solution" → "uses": 1
  - "layer" → "uses": 2
  - "called" → "layer": 1
  - "Metadata FTL" → "called": 2
  - "(MFTL)" → "Metadata FTL": 1

- **Distances from "are separated":**
  - "file system" → "metadata": 2
  - "metadata" → "are": 2
  - "userdata" → "are": 2
  - "where" → "uses": 3
  - "in" → "order": 1
  - "order" → "to": 2
  - "improve" → "order": 2
  - "performance" → "improve": 1

**Calculating the Total Distance and Number of Dependencies:**

Adding up each of those distances:

1 (suggested) + 1 (solution) + 2 (layer) + 1 (called) + 2 (Metadata FTL) + 1 (MFTL) +  
2 (file system) + 2 (metadata) + 2 (userdata) + 3 (where) + 1 (in) + 2 (order) + 2 (improve) + 1 (performance) = 24

Number of tokens: 18 tokens (including one punctuation mark) = 13 dependencies.

Calculating Average Dependency Distance:

Total distance = 24
Number of dependencies = 13

Average Dependency Distance = Total Distance / Number of Dependencies = 24 / 13 ≈ 1.85.

Thus, the average dependency distance for the sentence is approximately **1.85**.
