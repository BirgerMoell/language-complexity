To analyze the Swedish sentence and compute the average dependency distance, we first need to identify the dependency relations in the sentence. The sentence is composed of several clauses connected by conjunctions. 

Let's break it down:

1. **Sentence Structure**: 
   - "För chassiets del" (For the chassis' part) is an introductory phrase.
   - "är" (is) functions as the main verb connecting the subject to the necessary information.
   - "just nu" (just now) acts as an adverb modifying the verb.
   - "de huvudsakliga problemen" (the main problems) is the subject of the sentence.
   - "att skruvavstånden är för långa" (that the screw distances are too long) serves as a complement.
   - " mellan många skruvar" (between many screws) modifies the complement.
   - "ytorna är ytbehandlade med isolerande material" (the surfaces are treated with insulating material) is another independent clause.
   - "och" (and) connects the previous clause to the next one.
   - "klämkrafterna mellan skarvarna är för små" (the clamping forces between the seams are too small) is the third independent clause.

2. **Tokenization**: The sentence consists of the following tokens:
   - För, chassiets, del, är, just, nu, de, huvudsakliga, problemen, att, skruvavstånden, är, för, långa, mellan, många, skruvar, ,, ytorna, är, ytbehandlade, med, isolerande, material, och, klämkrafterna, mellan, skarvarna, är, för, små, .

3. **Calculate Dependency Distances**:
   - Let's analyze key dependencies and their distances:
     - "För" (1) to "del" (2): distance = 1.
     - "del" (1) to "är" (3): distance = 2.
     - "de" (1) to "problem" (4): distance = 3.
     - "problemen" (1) to "att" (5): distance = 4.
     - "skruvavstånden" (1) to "är" (3): distance = 2.
     - "är" (1) to "långa" (6): distance = 2.
     - Distance for "mellan" (11) to "skruvar" (10) is 1.
     - "ytorna" (12) to "är" (3): distance = 9.
     - Next clause "ytbehandlade" to "med" (13) distance = 3.
     - "klämkrafterna" (14) to "är" (3): distance = 11.
     - For "mellan" (17) to "skarvarna" (16), distance = 1.
     - Finally, "är" (3) to "små" (19): distance = 16.

   Each token's distance is summed and averaged over the number of dependencies. 

4. **Total Distances**: Summing these distances gives:
   - 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 9 + 3 + 11 + 1 + 16.

   This results in a total of 55 distances counted.

5. **Count Dependencies**: The number of dependencies will depend on how many valid relations you can find in this structure, which could be counted as approximately the number of tokens minus 1 (disregarding the root dependency) — about 25 dependencies.

6. **Average Dependency Distance**: Finally, divide the total distance sum by the number of dependencies:
   - Average = Total Distance / Number of Dependencies = 55 / 25 = 2.2

**Answer**: The average dependency distance for the given Swedish sentence is approximately **2.2**.
