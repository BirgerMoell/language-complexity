To analyze the sentence "Hur mycket visste omvärlden om de ryska arbetslägren, och vad som pågick i Sovjetunionen" and calculate the average dependency distance, we first identify the dependencies in the sentence. 

1. **Dependencies**:
   - "Hur" (Why) is dependent on "visste" (knew), distance = 1
   - "mycket" (much) is dependent on "visste", distance = 1
   - "omvärlden" (the world) is the subject and main noun in the clause, dependent on "visste", distance = 2
   - "om" (about) is dependent on "visste", distance = 1
   - "de" (the) is dependent on "arbetslägren" (labor camps), distance = 1
   - "ryska" (Russian) is dependent on "arbetslägren", distance = 1
   - "arbetslägren" is dependent on "om", distance = 2
   - "," (comma) is a punctuation mark, but will not count towards dependency distance here.
   - "och" (and) connects "arbetslägren" and "vad", distance = 2
   - "vad" (what) is dependent on "pågått" (was going on), distance = 2
   - "som" (that) is dependent on "vad", distance = 1
   - "pågått" is dependent on "vad", distance = 3
   - "i" (in) is a preposition modifying "Sovjetunionen" (Soviet Union), distance = 1
   - "Sovjetunionen" is dependent on "pågått", distance = 4

2. **Calculating the total dependency distance**:
   - Distances: 1 (Hur) + 1 (mycket) + 2 (omvärlden) + 1 (om) + 1 (de) + 1 (ryska) + 2 (arbetslägren) + 2 (och) + 2 (vad) + 1 (som) + 3 (pågått) + 1 (i) + 4 (Sovjetunionen) = 23

3. **Count the number of tokens**: 
   The total number of tokens in the sentence is 14.

4. **Average dependency distance**:
   Average Dependency Distance = Total Dependency Distance / Number of Dependencies = 23 / 13 = approximately 1.77

Thus, the average dependency distance for the sentence is **1.77**.
