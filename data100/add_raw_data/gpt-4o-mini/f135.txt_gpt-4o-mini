To calculate the average dependency distance for the provided Swedish sentence, we'll first identify all the dependency relations and their respective distances to their heads.

The breakdown of the sentence is as follows (with head words included for reference):

1. Så (adverb) -> head: lades: distance = 1
2. sent (adverb) -> head: lades: distance = 1
3. som (conjunction) -> head: 1939: distance = 2
4. 1939 (numeral) -> head: lades: distance = 3
5. lades (verb) -> head: ned: distance = 0
6. Sveriges (proper noun) -> head: stridsvagnsbataljon: distance = 2
7. enda (adjective) -> head: stridsvagnsbataljon: distance = 1
8. stridsvagnsbataljon (noun) -> head: lades: distance = 1
9. ned (verb) -> head: lades: distance = 0
10. , (punctuation) -> head: lades: distance = 2
11. och (conjunction) -> head: hade: distance = 3
12. innan (preposition) -> head: krigsutbrottet: distance = 3
13. krigsutbrottet (noun) -> head: hade: distance = 1
14. hade (verb) -> head: hunnit: distance = 0
15. endast (adverb) -> head: miljoner: distance = 1
16. 78 (numeral) -> head: miljoner: distance = 1
17. miljoner (noun) -> head: hunnit: distance = 2
18. av (preposition) -> head: anslagen: distance = 2
19. de (pronoun) -> head: anslagen: distance = 2
20. extra (adjective) -> head: anslagen: distance = 1
21. anslagen (noun) -> head: utnyttjas: distance = 2
22. hunnit (verb) -> head: utnyttjas: distance = 0
23. utnyttjas (verb) -> head: utnyttjas: distance = 0
24. . (punctuation) -> head: utnyttjas: distance = 5

Now, we'll sum the distances and count the number of dependencies (excluding roots where distance is 0):

- Total Distance = 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 5 = 43
- Number of Dependencies with non-zero distance = 24

Average Dependency Distance = Total Distance / Number of Dependencies = 43 / 24 ≈ 1.79

Thus, the average dependency distance for the sentence is approximately **1.79**.
