To analyze the given Swedish sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we first need to identify the dependency structure of the sentence. 

### Analyzing the dependency structure:
1. Identify the head of the sentence (main verb): "var" (was).
2. Identify the dependencies for each word based on their relationships.

For instance:
- "Sammanfattning" (summary) → "var": distance = 1
- "Syftet" (the purpose) → "var": distance = 1
- "med" (with) → "syftet": distance = 1
- "uppsatsen" (the essay) → "syftet": distance = 2
- "att" (to) → "var": distance = 1
- "analysera" (analyze) → "att": distance = 1
- "vad" (what) → "kan": distance = 2
- "som" (that) → "kan": distance = 1
- "kan" → "analysera": distance = 1
- "ge" (give) → "kan": distance = 1
- "arbetsglädje" (work joy) → "ge": distance = 1
- "samt" (and) → "ge": distance = 1
- "utvärdera" (evaluate) → "att": distance = 1
- "effekter" (effects) → "utvärdera": distance = 1
- "på" (on) → "effekter": distance = 1
- "upplevd" (experienced) → "hälsa": distance = 2
- "hälsa" (health) → "effekter": distance = 2
- "gott" (good) → "liv": distance = 1
- "liv" (life) → "effekter": distance = 2
- "arbetsglädje" (work joy) → "effekter": distance = 2
- "av" (of) → "åtgärder": distance = 2
- "de" (the) → "åtgärder": distance = 1
- "ergonomiska" (ergonomic) → "åtgärder": distance = 1
- "åtgärder" (measures) → "vidtagits": distance = 2
- "som" → "åtgärder": distance = 1
- "vidtagits" (taken) → "var": distance = 3
- "på" (at) → "företag": distance = 2
- "ett" (a) → "livsmedelsföretag": distance = 1
- "livsmedelsföretag" (food company) → "på": distance = 1

### Total distances and tokens:
Now we count the total distances and the number of tokens:
- Total distance = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 37
- Total tokens (including punctuation) = 26

### Calculating the average dependency distance:
\[ \text{Average Dependency Distance} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Tokens}} = \frac{37}{26} \approx 1.42 \]

Thus, the average dependency distance for the sentence is approximately **1.42**.
