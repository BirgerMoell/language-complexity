To analyze the provided English sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we must first identify the head of each token and compute their respective distances to that head.

The sentence is:

"Even though it’s young, it has already transformed itself multiple times and survived both super expansive growth and fire and depression."

### Step 1: Identify the Dependencies
1. **Even** (head: transformed) - distance: 2
2. **though** (head: transformed) - distance: 2
3. **it’s** (head: has) - distance: 1
4. **young** (head: it’s) - distance: 1
5. **,** (punctuation, still a token, head: transformed) - distance: 4
6. **it** (head: has) - distance: 2
7. **has** (head: transformed) - distance: 1
8. **already** (head: transformed) - distance: 2
9. **transformed** (head: transformed) - distance: 0
10. **itself** (head: transformed) - distance: 1
11. **multiple** (head: times) - distance: 3
12. **times** (head: transformed) - distance: 1
13. **and** (head: transformed) - distance: 3
14. **survived** (head: transformed) - distance: 1
15. **both** (head: super) - distance: 3
16. **super** (head: growth) - distance: 1
17. **expansive** (head: growth) - distance: 1
18. **growth** (head: survived) - distance: 1
19. **and** (head: growth) - distance: 3
20. **fire** (head: and) - distance: 1
21. **and** (head: depression) - distance: 2
22. **depression** (head: survived) - distance: 1

### Step 2: Summing the Distances
Now we add the distances:
- Total distance = 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 36

### Step 3: Count the Tokens
Count the total number of tokens:
- Total tokens = 22

### Step 4: Calculate Average Dependency Distance
Average dependency distance = Total distance / Total number of tokens = 36 / 22 ≈ 1.64

### Result
The average dependency distance for the sentence is approximately **1.64**.
