To analyze the sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we first need to identify the dependencies between the words. Based on natural language syntax, we will establish the relationships and the distances involved.

The sentence is: 
"Jag vet att åtminstone att jag skulle vilja bli bemött och behandlad på samma sätt som alla andra blev om jag kom till ett annat land."

For simplicity, let's focus on some key dependencies:

1. "Jag" (I) → "vet" (know): Distance = 1
2. "att" → "vet": Distance = 1 (the clause introduces a complement)
3. "åtminstone" (at least) → "att": Distance = 1
4. "att" → "jag": Distance = 3 (second clause)
5. "skulle" (would) → "vilja": Distance = 1 
6. "vilja" → "bli": Distance = 1
7. "bemött" → "bli": Distance = 0 (no distance as it's part of the same verb phrase)
8. "behandlad" → "bli": Distance = 0
9. "sätt" (way) → "som": Distance = 1
10. "alla" (all) → "andra": Distance = 1
11. "andra" → "blev": Distance = 2
12. "om" (if) → "blev": Distance = 1
13. "kom" (came) → "land": Distance = 3
14. "till" → "land": Distance = 1
15. Additional dependencies could include relationships for "samma", "ett", "annat", etc.

Now, we summarize the distances calculated:
1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1

Count the total number of dependencies and their distances:
- Total distance = 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 17
- Total dependencies = 14 

Now, we calculate the average dependency distance:
Average dependency distance = Total distance / Number of dependencies = 17 / 14 ≈ 1.21

Therefore, the average dependency distance for the given Swedish sentence is approximately **1.21**.
