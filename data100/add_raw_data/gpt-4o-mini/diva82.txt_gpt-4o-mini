To calculate the average dependency distance for the sentence provided, we first need to identify the head of each token and calculate the dependency distances from each token to its head.

The sentence is: "Stockholm, december 2009 Patrik Berggren iii Sammanfattning Byggnadsbeståndet i Sverige blir bara äldre och äldre."

Let's break down the tokens and their heads:

1. Stockholm → (head: n/a)
2. , → (head: Stockholm) → distance: 1
3. december → (head: n/a)
4. 2009 → (head: n/a)
5. Patrik → (head: n/a)
6. Berggren → (head: n/a)
7. iii → (head: n/a)
8. Sammanfattning → (head: n/a)
9. Byggnadsbeståndet → (head: n/a)
10. i → (head: Byggnadsbeståndet) → distance: 1
11. Sverige → (head: i) → distance: 1
12. blir → (head: n/a)
13. bara → (head: blir) → distance: 1
14. äldre → (head: blir) → distance: 1
15. och → (head: äldre) → distance: 1
16. äldre → (head: blir) → distance: 1

Now, let's denote the distances we calculated:
- From "," to "Stockholm": 1
- From "i" to "Byggnadsbeståndet": 1
- From "Sverige" to "i": 1
- From "bara" to "blir": 1
- From "äldre" (1st occurrence) to "blir": 1
- From "och" to "äldre" (1st occurrence): 1
- From "äldre" (2nd occurrence) to "blir": 1

We need to sum these distances. The total sum of distances is: 

1 (for ',') + 1 (for 'i') + 1 (for 'Sverige') + 1 (for 'bara') + 1 (for 'äldre') + 1 (for 'och') + 1 (for 'äldre') = 7.

Next, we count the number of tokens, which in this case gives us a total of 16 tokens (considering counting all tokens including punctuation).

Finally, we calculate the average dependency distance:

Average Dependency Distance = Total Distance Sum / Number of Tokens = 7 / 16 = 0.4375.

Therefore, the average dependency distance for the given Swedish sentence is **0.44** (rounded to two decimal places).
