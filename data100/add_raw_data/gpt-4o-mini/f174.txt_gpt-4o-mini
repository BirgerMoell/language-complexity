To calculate the average dependency distance for the Swedish sentence: 

"så viftar hundar på svansen när de är glada, eller så springer vildsvin för livet när de får syn på ett rovdjur."

we first need to determine the dependencies and their distances. 

1. **Identify the main verb and its subjects/objects:**

   - "viftar" is the main verb, with:
     - Subject: "hundar" (distance = 1)
     - Object: "svansen" (distance = 2) from "viftar"
     - Modifier: "på" (distance = 2) from "svansen"
   - "är" connects to "de" (subject) (distance = 1) 
   - "glada" modifies "de" (distance = 1)
   - "springer" is another main verb, with:
     - Subject: "vildsvin" (distance = 1)
     - Object/Modifier: "livet" (distance = 2) from "springer"
   - Similarly, "får" connects to "de" (distance = 1)
   - "syn" (object) and "rovdjur" (distance = 1) from "syn"

2. **Count the total distances:**
   - "så" to "viftar" (2)
   - "hundar" to "viftar" (1)
   - "svansen" to "viftar" (2)
   - "de" to "är" (1)
   - "glada" to "är" (1)
   - "så" to "springer" (2)
   - "vildsvin" to "springer" (1)
   - "livet" to "springer" (2)
   - "de" to "får" (1)
   - "syn" to "får" (1)
   - "rovdjur" to "syn" (1)

3. **Sum of distances:**
   - Total distances: 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 16.

4. **Count the number of dependencies:** 
   - Total dependencies: 11 (the number of words connected to their heads).

5. **Calculate the average dependency distance:**
   - Average dependency distance = Total distances / Total dependencies = 16 / 11 ≈ 1.45.

So, the average dependency distance for the given sentence is approximately **1.45**.
