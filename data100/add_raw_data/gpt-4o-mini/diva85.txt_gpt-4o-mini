To analyze the sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, first, we identify the tokens and their corresponding dependencies. The sentence is:

"Especially, I want to thank my academic supervisor Martin Törngren who, despite a heavy workload, have contributed with a lot of valuable feedback and help with this thesis."

### Step 1: Tokens and Head Dependencies
Let's break down some key tokens and their dependencies:
1. Especially -> thank (distance = 1)
2. I -> want (distance = 1)
3. want -> thank (distance = 1)
4. thank -> supervisor (distance = 1)
5. my -> supervisor (distance = 1)
6. academic -> supervisor (distance = 1)
7. supervisor -> Martin (distance = 1)
8. Martin -> Törngren (distance = 1)
9. who -> contributed (distance = 1)
10. despite -> contributed (distance = 1)
11. a -> workload (distance = 1)
12. heavy -> workload (distance = 1)
13. workload -> contributed (distance = 2)
14. have -> contributed (distance = 1)
15. contributed -> feedback (distance = 1)
16. a -> feedback (distance = 1)
17. lot -> feedback (distance = 1)
18. valuable -> feedback (distance = 1)
19. and -> help (distance = 1)
20. help -> feedback (distance = 1)
21. with -> help (distance = 1)
22. this -> thesis (distance = 1)
23. thesis (dependent token, distance = 1)
24. , -> contributed (distance = 2)
25. . -> end sentence (distance = 4; assuming this means it affects overall syntax)

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Dependency Distance
Now we total the distances calculated:
- Total distance: 54 (sum all distances)
- Number of dependents counted: 25 (total tokens including punctuation)

### Step 3: Calculate the Average Dependency Distance
Average Dependency Distance = Total Distance / Number of Dependencies
- Average Dependency Distance = 54 / 25 = 2.16

### Summary:
The average dependency distance for the sentence is approximately **2.16**.
