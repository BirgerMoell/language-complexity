To analyze the provided sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we first identify the dependencies and their distances:

The sentence is:
"An academic benchmark case (Unsteady Aerodynamics Experiment Phase III) was selected as a starting point of the optimization because wind tunnel data was available for that campain."

1. **Tokenization**: The tokens in the sentence are:
   - An
   - academic
   - benchmark
   - case
   - (
   - Unsteady
   - Aerodynamics
   - Experiment
   - Phase
   - III
   - )
   - was
   - selected
   - as
   - a
   - starting
   - point
   - of
   - the
   - optimization
   - because
   - wind
   - tunnel
   - data
   - was
   - available
   - for
   - that
   - campain
   - .

2. **Dependency Structure**: Let's assume a simplified dependency structure. For demonstration purposes, the main heads can be identified (though actual linguistic parsing would need to be performed for precise analysis).

   - An (modifies) case
   - academic (modifies) case
   - benchmark (modifies) case
   - case (subject to) was
   - was (main verb)
   - selected (main verb)
   - as (introduces complement)
   - a (modifies) point
   - starting (modifies) point
   - point (object of selected)
   - of (introduces complement)
   - the (modifies) optimization
   - optimization (object of point)
   - because (subordinating conjunction)
   - wind (modifies) tunnel
   - tunnel (modifies) data
   - data (subject to) was
   - was (main verb in subordinate clause)
   - available (complement of was)
   - for (introduces complement)
   - that (modifies) campain
   - campain (object of for)
   - . (punctuation)

3. **Distance Calculation**: Now, we calculate the dependency distances:

   - "An" to "case" = 1
   - "academic" to "case" = 1
   - "benchmark" to "case" = 1
   - "case" to "was" = 2
   - "(" to "case" = 4 (to nearest key word "case")
   - "Unsteady" to "Experiment" = 3
   - "Aerodynamics" to "Experiment" = 2
   - "Experiment" to "case" = 3
   - "Phase" to "Experiment" = 1
   - "III" to "Experiment" = 2
   - ")" to "case" = 5
   - "was" to "selected" = 1 
   - "as" to "point" = 2
   - "a" to "point" = 1
   - "starting" to "point" = 1
   - "point" to "selected" = 1
   - "of" to "optimization" = 2
   - "the" to "optimization" = 1
   - "optimization" to "point" = 1
   - "because" to "was" = 1
   - "wind" to "tunnel" = 1
   - "tunnel" to "data" = 1
   - "data" to "was" = 1
   - "was" to "available" = 1
   - "available" to "was" = 1
   - "for" to "campain" = 3
   - "that" to "campain" = 1
   - "campain" to "for" = 1
   - "." to "was" = 5

4. **Sum of Distances**: 
   - Total distance = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 5 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 5 = 56

5. **Calculating Average**:
   - Number of tokens = 30
   - Average dependency distance = Total distance / Number of tokens = 56 / 30 = 1.87

Therefore, the average dependency distance of the analyzed sentence is approximately **1.87**.
