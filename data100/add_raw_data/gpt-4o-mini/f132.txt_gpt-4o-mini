To calculate the average dependency distance for the given Swedish sentence, we need to identify the dependencies between each word and their heads. Let's break down the sentence into its components and calculate the distances.

1. **Dependencies Analysis**: 
   - Each word in the sentence connects to its head (governing word). 
   - We measure the distance in terms of how many tokens are between the word and its head.

2. **Sentence Breakdown**: 
   The sentence consists of multiple clauses with various dependencies. The simplest representations of these dependencies lead to the following calculations (approximations):

   - "Somalia" → "har" (distance: 1)
   - "har" is the root, hence distance is 0.
   - "jättehög" → "spädbarnsdödlighet" (distance: 1)
   - "spädbarnsdödlighet" → "har" (distance: 2)
   - "och" → "spädbarnsdödlighet" (distance: 2)
   - "relativt" → "låg" (distance: 1)
   - "låg" → "medel" (distance: 1)
   - "medel" → "livsålder" (distance: 1)
   - "det" → "beror" (distance: 1)
   - "på" → "beror" (distance: 1)
   - "att" → "har" (distance: 2)
   - "landet" → "har" (distance: 3)
   - "har" (distance: 0 as head)
   - "sämre" → "sjukvård" (distance: 1)
   - "än" → "har" (distance: 3)
   - "vad" → "har" (distance: 3)
   - "extrem" → "ekonomibrist" (distance: 1)
   - "pengarna" → "läggs" (distance: 3)
   - "inte" → "läggs" (distance: 1)
   - "ner" → "läggs" (distance: 1)
   - "på" → "sjukvården" (distance: 1)
   - "väldigt" → "dåliga" (distance: 1)
   - "dåliga" → "vattenförhållanden" (distance: 1)
   - "dålig" → "miljö" (distance: 1)
   - "klanverksamheten" → "är" (distance: 4)
   - "inbördeskriget" → "är" (distance: 4)
   - "stora" → "faktorer" (distance: 1)
   - "bidragande" → "faktorer" (distance: 1)
   - "faktorer" → "är" (distance: 2)
   - "till" → "är" (distance: 3)
   - "Somalias" → "låga" (distance: 2)
   - "låga" → "livsålder" (distance: 1)

3. **Total Distance Calculation**:
   - Count all the distances: 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 55 

4. **Total Number of Words**: 
   - The sentence consists of 40 tokens.

5. **Average Dependency Distance Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Average Dependency Distance} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Number of Words}} = \frac{55}{40} = 1.375
   \]

Thus, the average dependency distance for the given Swedish sentence is **1.375**.
