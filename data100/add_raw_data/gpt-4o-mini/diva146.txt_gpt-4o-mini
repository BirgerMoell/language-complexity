To calculate the average dependency distance for the given sentence, we first need to identify the dependencies and their respective distances.

### Sentence:
"Today, new buildings are already being constructed on contaminated land, and in the future contaminated land will probably constitute an important part of the exploitable land with population growing."

### Dependencies and Distances:
- **Today** (head: constructed) -> Distance = 4
- **new** (head: buildings) -> Distance = 1
- **buildings** (head: are) -> Distance = 2
- **are** (head: constructed) -> Distance = 1
- **already** (head: being) -> Distance = 2
- **being** (head: constructed) -> Distance = 1
- **constructed** (head: are) -> Distance = 0 (not counted since it's the root)
- **on** (head: constructed) -> Distance = 2
- **contaminated** (head: land) -> Distance = 0 (not counted since it's the head of this phrase)
- **land** (head: constructed) -> Distance = 1
- **and** (head: will) -> Distance = 4
- **in** (head: future) -> Distance = 2
- **the** (head: future) -> Distance = 2
- **future** (head: will) -> Distance = 0 (not counted since it's the head of this phrase)
- **will** (head: constitute) -> Distance = 0 (not counted since it's the head of this phrase)
- **probably** (head: constitute) -> Distance = 2
- **constitute** (head: will) -> Distance = 0 (not counted since it's the head of this phrase)
- **an** (head: important) -> Distance = 1
- **important** (head: part) -> Distance = 1
- **part** (head: constitute) -> Distance = 0 (not counted since it's the head of this phrase)
- **of** (head: part) -> Distance = 2
- **the** (head: land) -> Distance = 1
- **exploitable** (head: land) -> Distance = 0 (not counted since it's the head of this phrase)
- **land** (head: part) -> Distance = 1
- **with** (head: growing) -> Distance = 2
- **population** (head: growing) -> Distance = 1
- **growing** (head: land) -> Distance = 0 (not counted since it's the head of this phrase)

### Valid Dependency Distances:
Now, we will summarize the valid distances:
1. Today = 4
2. new = 1
3. buildings = 2
4. are = 1
5. already = 2
6. being = 1
7. on = 2
8. land = 1
9. and = 4
10. in = 2
11. the = 2
12. probably = 2
13. an = 1
14. important = 1
15. of = 2
16. the = 1
17. land = 1
18. with = 2
19. population = 1

### Total Distances and Tokens:
- Total distance = 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 28
- Total token count = 19

### Average Dependency Distance:
\[ \text{Average Dependency Distance} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Tokens}} = \frac{28}{19} \approx 1.47 \]

The average dependency distance for the given sentence is approximately **1.47**.
