To calculate the average dependency distance for the given English sentence, we first identify the head words of the sentence.

**Sentence Breakdown:**
- "If" (0, part of a conditional clause) does not have a direct dependency, but connects to "is"
- "the" (1) depends on "value" (4) → distance = 2
- "actual" (2) depends on "consumption" (3) → distance = 1
- "energy" (3) depends on "consumption" (3) → distance = 0
- "consumption" (3) depends on "is" (7) → distance = 4
- "is" (7) depends on the subject clause led by "we" (11) → distance = 4 (distance of 1 from "we" to "is" and 3 from "is" to the clause)
- "significantly" (8) depends on "below" (9) → distance = 1
- "below" (9) depends on "is" (7) → distance = 2
- "the" (10) depends on "value" (4) → distance = 6
- "reference" (11) depends on "value" (4) → distance = 7
- "value" (12) connects to "is" (7) → distance = 5
- "we" (11) connects to "believe" (16) → distance = 5
- "believe" (15) is the main verb for "we" (11) → distance = 4
- "that" (16) introduces a subordinate clause → distance = 6
- "a" (17) depends on "investigation" (19) → distance = 2
- "major" (18) depends on "investigation" (19) → distance = 1
- "costly" (19) depends on "investigation" (19) → distance = 0 
- "investigation" (19) reconnects back to "that" (16) → distance = 3
- "is" (20) connects to "investigation" (19) → distance = 1
- "not" (21) modifies "necessary" (22) → distance = 1
- "necessary" (22) depends on "is" (20) → distance = 2

**Calculating the Distances:**
- Total dependency distances: 
  - If: n/a (not calculated due to no head)
  - the: 6
  - actual: 1
  - energy: 4
  - consumption: 
      - 0 + 4 = 4
  - is: total from connections = 4 + 5 + 0 = 9
  - significantly: 1
  - below: 2
  - the: 6
  - reference: 7
  - value: 5
  - we: 5
  - believe: 4
  - that: 6
  - a: 2
  - major: 1
  - costly: 0
  - investigation: distance to is = 1 (to head)
  - not: 1
  - necessary: 2

**Sum of Distances: (partial for the breakdowns)**
Distances: 0 (if) + 2 + 1 + 4 + 0 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 5 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 35

Counting the total number of dependencies (excluding any words without head connections):
Total tokens: 22 
Total dependency connections: 20 (if is excluded for scoring)

**Average Dependency Distance:**
Average Dependency Distance = Total Distances / Total Token Connections = 35 / 20 = 1.75.

The average dependency distance for the provided sentence is **1.75**.
