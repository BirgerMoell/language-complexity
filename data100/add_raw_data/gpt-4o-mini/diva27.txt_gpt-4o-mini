To analyze the sentence "An IPM from International Rectifier has been modified and tested by letting the IPM drive a permanent magnet motor under typical load conditions for a long time." and calculate the average dependency distance, we need to consider the dependencies between words and measure the distance from each dependent word to its head (the governing word).

1. **Identify the dependencies**: We need to identify which word governs each dependent word and how many words separate them in the sentence. 

2. **Calculate the distances**: For each word, compute the distance to its head.

Here's a simplified analysis of some key dependencies:

- **"An"** (determiner) → "IPM" (noun) → Distance: 1
- **"IPM"** (noun) → "has" (auxiliary) → Distance: 2
- **"from"** (preposition) → "International Rectifier" (proper noun) → Distance: 3
- **"has"** (auxiliary) → "been" (auxiliary) → Distance: 1
- **"been"** (auxiliary) → "modified" (verb) → Distance: 1
- **"modified"** (verb) → "and" (conjunction) → Distance: 1
- **"tested"** (verb) → "by" (preposition) → Distance: 1
- **"letting"** (gerund) → "drive" (verb) → Distance: 1
- **"drive"** (verb) → "motor" (noun) → Distance: 1
- **"under"** (preposition) → "conditions" (noun) → Distance: 3
- **"for"** (preposition) → "time" (noun) → Distance: 3

3. **Count total distances**: Here, we count dependencies from several key words for simplicity:
  
Total Distances = 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 = 18

4. **Count total dependencies**: Count the number of dependencies (tokens in this case). There are 19 major dependent structures identified.

5. **Calculate the average dependency distance**:
\[ \text{Average Dependency Distance} = \frac{\text{Total Distances}}{\text{Total Dependencies}} = \frac{18}{19} \approx 0.95 \]

Thus, the average dependency distance for the given sentence is approximately **0.95**.
