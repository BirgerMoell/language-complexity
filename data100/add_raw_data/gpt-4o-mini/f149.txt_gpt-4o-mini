To calculate the average dependency distance for the sentence "Mellan åren 1885 och 1889 har störst i Götaland, och minst i Norrland.", we first identify the dependencies and their respective distances:

1. **Mellan**: dependency to "åren" (distance = 1)
2. **åren**: dependency to "har" (distance = 3)
3. **1885**: dependency to "åren" (distance = 1)
4. **och**: dependency to "1885" (distance = 2)
5. **1889**: dependency to "åren" (distance = 2)
6. **har**: dependency to "störst" (distance = 1)
7. **störst**: dependency to "i" (distance = 1)
8. **i**: dependency to "Götaland" (distance = 1)
9. **Götaland**: dependency to "," (distance = 1)
10. **, (comma)**: dependency to "och" (distance = 2)
11. **och**: dependency to "minst" (distance = 1)
12. **minst**: dependency to "i" (distance = 1)
13. **i**: dependency to "Norrland" (distance = 1)
14. **Norrland**: no further dependency (distance = 0)

Now we list out the distances:
- From "Mellan" to "åren" = 1
- From "åren" to "har" = 3
- From "1885" to "åren" = 1
- From "och" to "1885" = 2
- From "1889" to "åren" = 2
- From "har" to "störst" = 1
- From "störst" to "i" = 1
- From "i" to "Götaland" = 1
- From "Götaland" to "," = 1
- From "," to "och" = 2
- From "och" to "minst" = 1
- From "minst" to "i" = 1
- From "i" to "Norrland" = 1

Counting all the individual distances, we get:
1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 =  22

The number of dependencies in the sentence is 13.

The average dependency distance is calculated as:
Average Dependency Distance = Total Distance / Number of Dependencies = 22 / 13 ≈ 1.69

So, the average dependency distance for the sentence is approximately **1.69**.
