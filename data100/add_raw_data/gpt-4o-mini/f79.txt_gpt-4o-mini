To analyze the sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we'll identify each word's dependency distance from its head. Here’s the breakdown of dependencies in the given sentence:

1. **Tokens**: Total tokens = 25 (including punctuation).
2. **Dependencies**:
   - "Pontare" (0 distance to "avslutar") = 1
   - "avslutar" (head verb)
   - "intervjun" (2 distance to "avslutar") = 2 
   - "med" (1 distance to "säga") = 1
   - "att" (1 distance to "säga") = 1
   - "säga" (head infinitive)
   - "att" (1 distance to "är") = 1
   - "det" (1 distance to "är") = 1
   - "är" (head verb)
   - "fruktansvärt" (2 distance to "synd") = 2
   - "synd" (head adjective)
   - "att" (1 distance to "förstöra") = 1
   - "de" (1 distance to "mörka") = 1
   - "mörka" (1 distance to "krafterna") = 1
   - "krafterna" (head noun)
   - "måste" (1 distance to "komma") = 1
   - "komma" (head verb)
   - "in" (1 distance to "komma") = 1
   - "och" (1 distance to "försöka") = 1
   - "försöka" (head verb)
   - "förstöra" (head infinitive)
   - "något" (1 distance to "som") = 1
   - "som" (1 distance to "är") = 1
   - "egentligen" (2 distance to "är") = 2
   - "är" (head verb)
   - "menat" (1 distance to "att") = 1
   - "att" (1 distance to "stärka") = 1
   - "stärka" (head infinitive)
   - "alla" (1 distance to "människor") = 1
   - "människor" (head noun)
   - "oavsett" (1 distance to "hudfärg") = 1
   - "hudfärg" (1 distance to "eller") = 1
   - "eller" (1 distance to "nationalitet") = 1
   - "nationalitet" (head noun)
   - Punctuation marks are not separately counted here but contribute to distances in dependency parsing.

Now, adding up all the dependency distances we computed:
- Total distances: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 25
- Total tokens = 25 

Now, let's calculate the average dependency distance:
Average dependency distance = Total distances / Total tokens = 25 / 25 = 1.0

Therefore, the average dependency distance for the given Swedish sentence is **1.0**.
