To analyze the Swedish sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we first identify the tokens and their respective heads. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **Tokens and their Heads:**
   - "Syftet" (subject, head is "har"): distance = 1
   - "med" (preposition, head is "simuleringarna"): distance = 2
   - "simuleringarna" (object of "med"): head is "har": distance = 2
   - "har" (auxiliary, main verb): head is "har": distance = 0
   - "varit" (auxiliary verb): head is "har": distance = 1
   - "att" (to-infinitive marker): head is "undersöka": distance = 1
   - "undersöka" (infinitive): head is "har": distance = 2
   - "om" (subordinating conjunction): head is "undersöka": distance = 2
   - "det" (proform): head is "gör": distance = 3
   - "går" (verb): head is "gör": distance = 0
   - "att" (to-infinitive marker, another instance): head is "minimera": distance = 1
   - "minimera" (infinitive): head is "går": distance = 2
   - "den" (determiner): head is "kostnaden": distance = 2
   - "totala" (adjective): head is "kostnaden": distance = 1
   - "kostnaden" (object): head is "minimera": distance = 3
   - "investeringskostnader" (coordinated noun): head is "kostnaden": distance = 2
   - "samt" (conjunction): head is "investeringskostnader": distance = 1
   - "förväntade" (adjective): head is "avbrottskostnad": distance = 2
   - "avbrottskostnad" (object): head is "kostnaden": distance = 3
   - "genom" (preposition): head is "investeringar": distance = 1
   - "slumpvisa" (adjective): head is "investeringar": distance = 2
   - "investeringar" (object): head is "i": distance = 2
   - "i" (preposition): head is "ledningssektioner": distance = 2
   - "systemets" (possessive): head is "ledningssektioner": distance = 2
   - "ledningssektioner" (object of preposition): head is "genom": distance = 2

2. **Calculating Dependence Distances:**
We add all the dependency distances calculated:
- Total distance = 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 38

3. **Counting Tokens:**
The number of tokens is 22.

4. **Average Dependency Distance:**
Average = Total Distance / Number of Tokens = 38 / 22 = 1.73 (approximately).

Thus, the average dependency distance for the given sentence is approximately **1.73**.
