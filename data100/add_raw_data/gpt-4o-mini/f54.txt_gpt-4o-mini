To calculate the average dependency distance for the sentence:

"Den del av koden som ger order om andra saker utöver att sprida och gömma sig kallas ”payload”, dvs last på svenska."

Let's break it down into its components and their dependencies.

1. Identify the head of the main clause and its dependencies.
   - "kallas" (head verb)
   - Dependents: "Den", "del", "av", "koden", "som", "ger", "order", "om", "andra", "saker", "utöver", "att", "sprida", "och", "gömma", "sig", "payload", "dvs", "last", "på", "svenska".

2. Determine the distance from each token to its head:
   - From "Den" to "kallas": distance 2
   - From "del" to "kallas": distance 2
   - From "av" to "koden" (which depends on "del"): distance 3 (2 from "del" to "kallas" + 1 from "av" to "koden")
   - From "koden" to "kallas": distance 1
   - From "som" to "koden": distance 1
   - From "ger" to "kallas": distance 2
   - From "order" to "ger": distance 1
   - From "om" to "order": distance 1
   - From "andra" to "saker": distance 2 
   - From "saker" to "kallas": distance 4 
   - From "utöver" to "saker": distance 2 
   - From "att" to "sprida": distance 1 
   - From "sprida" to "kallas": distance 3 
   - From "och" to "gömma": distance 1 
   - From "gömma" to "kallas": distance 3 
   - From "sig" to "gömma": distance 1 
   - From "payload" to "kallas": distance 2 
   - From "dvs" to "last": distance 1
   - From "last" to "kallas": distance 2 
   - From "på" to "svenska": distance 1 
   - From "svenska" to "kallas": distance 4 

3. Count total dependency distances:
The distances are summed up as follows:
(2 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 4) = 40

4. Count the number of dependencies:
19 tokens are dependent on "kallas".

5. Calculate the average dependency distance:
Average dependency distance = Total distance / Number of dependencies = 40 / 19 = 2.11

Thus, the average dependency distance for the given Swedish sentence is approximately **2.11**.
