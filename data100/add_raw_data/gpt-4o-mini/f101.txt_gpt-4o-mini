To analyze the Swedish sentence "Delarna sätter man in i så kallade I/O-portar (In/Out-portar), och desto fler sådana man har, desto fler grafikkort och ljudkort m." and calculate the average dependency distance, we first identify the heads of each token and their distances from those heads. 

1. Each token is analyzed for its distance to its head:
   - "Delarna" (1 to "sätter") = 1
   - "sätter" (head) = 0 (itself)
   - "man" (1 to "sätter") = 1
   - "in" (1 to "sätter") = 1
   - "i" (1 to "in") = 1
   - "så" (1 to "kallade") = 1
   - "kallade" (head) = 0 (itself)
   - "I/O-portar" (1 to "kallade") = 2
   - "(" (1 to "I/O-portar") = 3
   - "In/Out-portar" (1 to "(") = 0
   - ")" (1 to "In/Out-portar") = 1
   - "," (1 to "sätter") = 2 (right after "portar")
   - "och" (1 to ",") = 1
   - "desto" (1 to "fler") = 1
   - "fler" (head) = 0 (itself)
   - "sådana" (1 to "fler") = 1
   - "man" (1 to "säger") = 1
   - "har" (head) = 0 (itself)
   - "," (1 to "har") = 1
   - "desto" (1 to "fler") = 1
   - "fler" (head) = 0 (itself)
   - "grafikkort" (1 to "fler") = 1
   - "och" (1 to "grafikkort") = 1
   - "ljudkort" (1 to "och") = 1
   - "m." (1 to "ljudkort") = 1

2. Now we add all distances:
   - Total distances = 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **20**

3. Count the number of tokens:
   - Number of tokens = 24

4. Now we compute the average dependency distance:
   - Average Dependency Distance = Total Distances / Number of Tokens = 20 / 24 = **0.83**

Therefore, the average dependency distance for the given sentence is approximately **0.83**.
