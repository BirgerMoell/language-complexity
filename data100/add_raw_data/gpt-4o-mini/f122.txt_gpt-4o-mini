To calculate the average dependency distance for the given Swedish sentence "Barnfamiljer som vistats i Sverige i minst 4 år som sökande, anses ha skäl på grund av vistelsetiden," we first need to identify the dependency relations between the words and their heads.

1. **Identify the words and their heads**:
   - "Barnfamiljer" (subject) → head: "anses"
   - "som" (relative pronoun) → head: "barnfamiljer"
   - "vistats" (verb) → head: "som"
   - "i" (preposition) → head: "vistats"
   - "Sverige" (noun) → head: "i"
   - "i" (preposition) → head: "år"
   - "minst" (adverb) → head: "4"
   - "4" (numeral) → head: "år"
   - "år" (noun) → head: "vistats"
   - "som" (relative pronoun) → head: "sökande"
   - "sökande" (noun) → head: "anses"
   - "anses" (verb) → head: main verb (matrix)
   - "ha" (verb) → head: "anses"
   - "skäl" (noun) → head: "ha"
   - "på" (preposition) → head: "skäl"
   - "grund" (noun) → head: "på"
   - "av" (preposition) → head: "grund"
   - "vistelsetiden" (noun) → head: "av"
   - "," (comma) → punctuation
   - "minst" (adverb) → head: "4" (considering its position in the sequence)

2. **Calculate the distance from each word to its head**:
   - "Barnfamiljer" → "anses": distance = 3
   - "som" → "barnfamiljer": distance = 1
   - "vistats" → "som": distance = 1
   - "i" → "vistats": distance = 1
   - "Sverige" → "i": distance = 1
   - "i" → "år": distance = 2
   - "minst" → "4": distance = 3
   - "4" → "år": distance = 2
   - "år" → "vistats": distance = 2
   - "som" → "sökande": distance = 1
   - "sökande" → "anses": distance = 1
   - "anses" → main verb: distance = 0
   - "ha" → "anses": distance = 1
   - "skäl" → "ha": distance = 1
   - "på" → "skäl": distance = 1
   - "grund" → "på": distance = 1
   - "av" → "grund": distance = 1
   - "vistelsetiden" → "av": distance = 1
   - ",": Not counted as it is punctuation and has no dependency distance
   - "minst" → "4": distance = 3

3. **Sum the distances and count the words**:
   Summing the distances:
   3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 21

   Counting the words including punctuation as tokens gives us:
   Total tokens = 17

4. **Calculate the average dependency distance**:
   Average dependency distance = Total distance / Total tokens = 21 / 17 = 1.24

So, the average dependency distance for the sentence is approximately **1.24**.
