To analyze the sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we will first identify the words and their respective heads. The sentence is:

"För att dimensionera denna bypassventil inför tillverkning samt för att undersöka bypassventilens inverkan på motorn utfördes simuleringar i GT-Power."

To determine the dependency distances, we will need to identify the dependency relationships in the sentence:

1. "För" → "dimensionera" (distance: 1)
2. "att" → "dimensionera" (distance: 1)
3. "dimensionera" → "bypassventil" (distance: 1)
4. "denna" → "bypassventil" (distance: 1)
5. "inför" → "tillverkning" (distance: 1)
6. "tillverkning" is a conjunction to "samt" (distance: 1)
7. "för" → "undersöka" (distance: 1)
8. "att" → "undersöka" (distance: 1)
9. "undersöka" → "bypassventilens" (distance: 1)
10. "bypassventilens" → "inverkan" (distance: 1)
11. "inverkan" → "motorn" (distance: 1)
12. "utfördes" → "simuleringar" (distance: 1)
13. "simuleringar" → "i" (distance: 1)
14. "i" → "GT-Power" (distance: 1)
15. "GT-Power" is also a complement to "simuleringar" (distance: 1)

Now let's calculate the average dependency distance:

1. Each of the words listed has a dependency relationship that results in a distance of 1 from their head or parent.
2. Count the total number of words and their dependencies. The number of distances is 15.
3. The total distance is \(1 \times 15 = 15\).

Now, we calculate the average dependency distance:

Average Dependency Distance = Total Distance / Number of Dependencies  
= \(15 / 15\)  
= \(1.00\).

Therefore, the average dependency distance for the analyzed Swedish sentence is **1.00**.
