To calculate the average dependency distance in the sentence "Som metod valdes att studera befintliga arbetsprocesser på Scania samt att utföra semistrukturerade intervjuer med personer i funktioner inom motor som idag arbetar med dessa frågor.", we first identify the head and its dependents along with their corresponding distances. We consider the distance to be the number of tokens between a word and its head.

Let's break down the analysis step by step:

1. **Tokenization**: We will tokenize the sentence, considering all words and punctuation marks. The sentence has 23 tokens.

2. **Dependency structure**: For a detailed analysis, we would ideally have the dependency parse tree for the sentence. However, we can estimate based on typical Swedish syntax. The main verb "valdes" acts as the head of the clause, with "metod" as its subject. The infinitives and their complements would attach to "valdes" and other verbs as needed.

3. **Calculating distances**:

- For "Som" (1) -> "metod" (2) -> "valdes" (0): Distance 2 + 1 = 3
- For "metod" (0) -> "valdes" (0): Distance 0
- For "att" (2) -> "studera" (1): Distance 1
- For "befintliga" (3) -> "arbetsprocesser" (1): Distance 2
- For "arbetsprocesser" (2) -> "valdes" (0): Distance 2
- For "på" (2) -> "Scania" (1): Distance 1
- For "samt" (2) -> "att" (1): Distance 1
- For "att" (2) -> "utföra" (1): Distance 1
- For "semistrukturerade" (4) -> "intervjuer" (1): Distance 3
- For "intervjuer" (3) -> "med" (1): Distance 2
- For "personer" (4) -> "i" (1): Distance 3
- For "funktioner" (5) -> "inom" (1): Distance 4
- For "motor" (1) -> "som" (1): Distance 0
- For "idag" (1) -> "arbetar" (1): Distance 0
- For "arbetar" (0) -> "med" (1): Distance 1
- For "dessa" (2) -> "frågor" (1): Distance 1

Total distances calculated above sum to: 3 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 25.

4. **Count the number of dependencies**:
From the analysis, we have 23 tokens leading to 15 dependency links (every token likely has a dependency except the main verb and prepositions, where they serve as heads).

5. **Average Dependency Distance Calculation**:
Now we compute the average dependency distance as follows:

\[
\text{Average Dependency Distance} = \frac{\text{Total Dependency Distance}}{\text{Number of Dependencies}} = \frac{25}{15} \approx 1.67
\]

Therefore, the average dependency distance for the provided Swedish sentence is approximately **1.67**.
