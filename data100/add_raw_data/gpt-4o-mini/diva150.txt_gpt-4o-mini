To analyze the Swedish sentence "An extensive literature study has been made to evaluate all techniques on the market and characterize what separates the different processes." and calculate the average dependency distance, we start by identifying the head of each token and their respective distances.

1. **Token and Head Identification**:
   - **An** → head: **study** (distance = 2)
   - **extensive** → head: **study** (distance = 1)
   - **literature** → head: **study** (distance = 1)
   - **study** → head: **made** (distance = 1)
   - **has** → head: **made** (distance = 1)
   - **been** → head: **made** (distance = 1)
   - **made** → head: **evaluate** (distance = 3)
   - **to** → head: **evaluate** (distance = 1)
   - **evaluate** → head: **characterize** (distance = 1)
   - **all** → head: **techniques** (distance = 1)
   - **techniques** → head: **evaluate** (distance = 2)
   - **on** → head: **market** (distance = 1)
   - **the** → head: **market** (distance = 1)
   - **market** → head: **evaluate** (distance = 3)
   - **and** → head: **characterize** (distance = 2)
   - **characterize** → head: **processes** (distance = 3)
   - **what** → head: **separates** (distance = 1)
   - **separates** → head: **processes** (distance = 1)
   - **the** → head: **processes** (distance = 1)
   - **different** → head: **processes** (distance = 1)
   - **processes** → head: none (or could be seen as independent)

2. **Calculating Distances**:
   Now, we list all the distances:
   - Distance = 2 (An)
   - Distance = 1 (extensive)
   - Distance = 1 (literature)
   - Distance = 1 (study)
   - Distance = 1 (has)
   - Distance = 1 (been)
   - Distance = 3 (made)
   - Distance = 1 (to)
   - Distance = 1 (evaluate)
   - Distance = 2 (all)
   - Distance = 1 (techniques)
   - Distance = 1 (on)
   - Distance = 1 (the)
   - Distance = 3 (market)
   - Distance = 2 (and)
   - Distance = 3 (characterize)
   - Distance = 1 (what)
   - Distance = 1 (separates)
   - Distance = 1 (the)
   - Distance = 1 (different)
   - Distance = 1 (processes)

3. **Summing Distances**:
Total distances = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = **26**

4. **Counting Tokens**:
There are **20 tokens** in total.

5. **Average Dependency Distance**:
Average = Total Distances / Total Tokens = 26 / 20 = **1.30**

Thus, the average dependency distance for the given sentence is **1.30**.
