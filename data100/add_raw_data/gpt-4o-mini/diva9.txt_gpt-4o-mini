To calculate the average dependency distance for the provided sentence, we first need to identify the head of each token and the distance from each dependent token to its head.

Here’s a basic breakdown of the tokens in the provided sentence:
1. The (1)
2. study (0)
3. concludes (0)
4. in (1)
5. that (2)
6. ‘a (1)
7. sense (1)
8. of (1)
9. place’ (1)
10. as (2)
11. defined (2)
12. within (1)
13. the (2)
14. study (1)
15. , (3)
16. is (0)
17. highly (1)
18. relevant (1)
19. and (0)
20. present (1)
21. in (1)
22. Swedish (2)
23. municipal (2)
24. planning (1)
25. practice (1)
26. . (7)

Now, calculate each dependency distance:
- The to study: 1
- study to concludes: 0
- concludes to in: 0
- in to that: 1
- that to ‘a: 2
- ‘a to sense: 1
- sense to of: 1
- of to place’: 1
- place’ to as: 2
- as to defined: 2
- defined to within: 1
- within to the: 2
- the to study: 1
- study to ,: 3
- , to is: 3
- is to highly: 1
- highly to relevant: 1
- relevant to and: 0
- and to present: 1
- present to in: 1
- in to Swedish: 2
- Swedish to municipal: 2
- municipal to planning: 1
- planning to practice: 1
- practice to .: 7

Now, total the distances:
1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 7 = 25

Next, count the number of tokens (including punctuation): 26 tokens.

Finally, divide the total dependency distance by the number of dependent tokens. Note that the number of head tokens should be counted carefully. Since not every token has a dependent, we consider only the dependents, which include all except the heads.

The number of dependencies (tokens which are not heads): 23

Average dependency distance = Total distances / Number of dependencies = 25 / 23 ≈ 1.09

Thus, the average dependency distance for the given sentence is approximately **1.09**.
