To analyze the sentence "Viruset aktiveras då användaren kör det program som viruset infekterat" and calculate the average dependency distance, we first need to identify the dependency relations between words.

1. **Identify words and their dependencies:**
   - "Viruset" (Virus) → head is "aktiveras"
   - "aktiveras" (activates) → is the main verb
   - "då" (when) → modifies "aktiveras"
   - "användaren" (the user) → head is "kör"
   - "kör" (runs) → another verb connected to "program"
   - "det" (it) → modifies "program"
   - "program" (program) → head is "kör"
   - "som" (that) → introduces relative clause modifying "program"
   - "virus" (virus) → modifies "infekterat"
   - "infekterat" (infected) is the main verb in the relative clause

2. **Calculate distances:**
   - "Viruset" → "aktiveras": distance = 1
   - "aktiveras" → "då": distance = 1
   - "användaren" → "kör": distance = 1
   - "det" → "program": distance = 1
   - "program" → "kör": distance = 1
   - "som" → "program": distance = 1
   - "virus" (in "viruset") → "infekterat": 2
   - "infekterat" → "program": distance = 1 (from "virus" to "infekterat")

3. **Distance totals:**
   - "Viruset" (1) + "aktiveras" (1) + "då" (1) + "användaren" (1) + "det" (1) + "program" (1) + "som" (1) + "virus" (2) + "infekterat" (1) = 10 distances
   - Total number of tokens = 10.

4. **Calculate average dependency distance:**
   \[
   \text{Average Dependency Distance} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Number of Tokens}} = \frac{10}{9} \approx 1.11
   \]

Thus, the average dependency distance for the sentence is approximately **1.11**.
