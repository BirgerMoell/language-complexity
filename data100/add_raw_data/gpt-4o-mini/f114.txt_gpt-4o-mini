To calculate the average dependency distance for the given Swedish sentence, we first need to determine the dependencies between the words (tokens) and their heads. The sentence is:

"Den del av koden som ger order om andra saker utöver att sprida och gömma sig kallas ”payload”, dvs last på svenska."

1. **Tokenization**: The sentence contains the following tokens:
   - Den
   - del
   - av
   - koden
   - som
   - ger
   - order
   - om
   - andra
   - saker
   - utöver
   - att
   - sprida
   - och
   - gömma
   - sig
   - kallas
   - ”payload”
   - ,
   - dvs
   - last
   - på
   - svenska
   - .

2. **Dependency parsing**: We'll need to understand the head for each token and their respective distances. For simplicity, let’s define the following rough dependency structure:
   - "Den" (1) → "del" (1) → "koden" (1) → "ger" (2) → "order" (1) → "som" (2) → "saker" (2) → "utöver" (1) → "att" (1) → "sprida" (1) and "gömma" (1) → "sig" (1) 
   - "kallas" (2) → "payload" (1) and 
   - "dvs" (1) → "last" (1) 
   - "på" (1) → "svenska" (1)

3. **Calculating distances**:
   - Distance from "Den" to "del" = 1 
   - Distance from "del" to "koden" = 1
   - Distance from "koden" to "som" = 1
   - Distance from "som" to "ger" = 2
   - Distance from "ger" to "order" = 1
   - Distance from "order" to "om" = 1
   - Distance from "om" to "andra" = 1
   - Distance from "andra" to "saker" = 1
   - Distance from "saker" to "utöver" = 2
   - Distance from "utöver" to "att" = 1
   - Distance from "att" to "sprida" = 1
   - Distance from "att" to "gömma" = 1
   - Distance from "sprida" to "sig" = 1
   - Distance from "sig" to "kallas" = 2
   - Distance from "kallas" to "payload" = 1
   - Distance from "payload" to "," = 1
   - Distance from "," to "dvs" = 1
   - Distance from "dvs" to "last" = 1
   - Distance from "last" to "på" = 1
   - Distance from "på" to "svenska" = 1
   - Distance from "svenska" to "." = 1

Now, we can compute the total dependency distances and the number of dependencies:

**Total distances** = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 19

**Number of dependencies** = 21 (tokens in the sentence including punctuation)

4. **Average dependency distance calculation**:
   - Average Dependency Distance = Total distances / Number of dependencies = 19 / 21 ≈ 0.90

Therefore, the average dependency distance of the sentence is approximately **0.90**.
