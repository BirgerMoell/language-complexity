To calculate the average dependency distance in the Swedish sentence "Jag hoppas att ni som läser detta arbete ska uppskatta det och få ut lika mycket kunskap av det som jag har fått," we first need to determine the dependencies of each word in relation to their heads.

1. **Tokenization and Dependencies**:
   - "Jag" (I) → head is "hoppas" (hopes): distance = 1
   - "hoppas" (hopes) → head is the main verb: distance = 0 (its own head)
   - "att" (that) → head is "hoppas": distance = 1
   - "ni" (you) → head is "läser": distance = 3
   - "som" (who) → head is "ni": distance = 1
   - "läser" (reads) → head is "hoppas": distance = 2
   - "detta" (this) → head is "arbete": distance = 1
   - "arbete" (work) → head is "läser": distance = 2
   - "ska" (shall) → head is "uppskatta": distance = 1
   - "uppskatta" (appreciate) → head is "hoppas": distance = 2
   - "det" (it) → head is "uppskatta": distance = 1
   - "och" (and) → head is "uppskatta": distance = 3
   - "få" (get) → head is "ut": distance = 2
   - "ut" (out) → head is "få": distance = 1
   - "lika" (as) → head is "mycket": distance = 1
   - "mycket" (much) → head is "kunskap": distance = 2
   - "kunskap" (knowledge) → head is "ut": distance = 3
   - "av" (of) → head is "kunskap": distance = 1
   - "det" (it) → head is "få": distance = 2
   - "som" (that) → head is "jag": distance = 4
   - "jag" (I) → head is "fått": distance = 4
   - "har" (have) → head is "fått": distance = 1
   - "fått" (got): distance = 0 (its own head)

2. **Total Distances**:
   Now we sum these distances:
   - Distances: 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 0 = 42

3. **Total Number of Tokens**:
   The sentence contains **22 tokens**.

4. **Average Dependency Distance**:
   Average dependency distance = Total distance / Number of tokens = 42 / 22 ≈ 1.91

Therefore, the average dependency distance for the given sentence is approximately **1.91**.
