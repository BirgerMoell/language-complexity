To properly analyze the dependency distance of a sentence, we need to identify the dependency relations between the tokens. However, "Longest Sentence" is not a complete Swedish sentence, and it appears to lack sufficient context.

If you meant to provide a different Swedish sentence, please do so for a more accurate analysis. If the sentence is indeed "Longest Sentence," there are no clear dependencies to analyze. 

Please provide a complete Swedish sentence for accurate dependency distance calculation.
