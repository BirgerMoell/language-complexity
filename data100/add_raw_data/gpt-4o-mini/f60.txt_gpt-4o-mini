To analyze the Swedish sentence "Fördelar & nackdelarUSB - fördelarImplementerad standard i PC och som har stort operativssystemsstöd, i t.", we first identify the dependencies and their distances:

1. "Fördelar" (head) to "&": distance = 1
2. "&" to "nackdelarUSB": distance = 1
3. "nackdelarUSB" to "-": distance = 1
4. "-" to "fördelarImplementerad": distance = 1
5. "fördelarImplementerad" to "standard": distance = 0 (head)
6. "standard" to "i": distance = 1
7. "i" to "PC": distance = 1
8. "PC" to "och": distance = 1
9. "och" to "som": distance = 1
10. "som" to "har": distance = 1
11. "har" to "stort": distance = 1
12. "stort" to "operativssystemsstöd": distance = 1
13. "operativssystemsstöd" to ",": distance = 1
14. "," to "i": distance = 1
15. "i" to "t": distance = 1
16. "t" to "": distance = 0 (doesn't count)

Now, let's count the total distance:

- Tokens: 14 (since we ignore the last token as it’s not attached to anything)
- Total dependency distances = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 13

Now, we calculate the average dependency distance:

Average Dependency Distance = Total Distance / Number of Dependent Tokens
= 13 / 14 ≈ 0.93

Therefore, the average dependency distance for the given sentence is approximately **0.93**.
