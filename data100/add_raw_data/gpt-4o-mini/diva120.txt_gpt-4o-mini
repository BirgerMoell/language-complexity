To analyze the given sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we first need to identify the tokens and their relationships. Here’s the segmentation of the sentence and the dependencies:

**Sentence:** "The city is currently growing and densifying in a rapid pace and most of the new buildings are being built in existing environments."

### Tokenization
1. The
2. city
3. is
4. currently
5. growing
6. and
7. densifying
8. in
9. a
10. rapid
11. pace
12. and
13. most
14. of
15. the
16. new
17. buildings
18. are
19. being
20. built
21. in
22. existing
23. environments
24. .

### Dependency Analysis
For simplicity, I will summarize the dependencies and their distances:

1. **The** → **city**: 1
2. **city** → **is**: 1
3. **is** → **growing**: 1
4. **currently** → **growing**: 1
5. **growing** → **and**: 1
6. **densifying** → **and**: 1
7. **and** → **growing**: 1 (shared between growing and densifying)
8. **in** → **densifying**: 2
9. **a** → **pace**: 1
10. **rapid** → **pace**: 1
11. **pace** → **in**: 2
12. **and** → **buildings**: 2 (shared)
13. **most** → **buildings**: 1
14. **of** → **most**: 1
15. **the** → **buildings**: 1
16. **new** → **buildings**: 1
17. **buildings** → **are**: 1
18. **are** → **being**: 1
19. **being** → **built**: 1
20. **in** → **built**: 2
21. **existing** → **environments**: 1
22. **environments** → **built**: 2
23. **built** → **built**: 0 (self)

### Calculating Total Distances
Now, we need to sum all the dependency distances:

- Total distances: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 = 30
- Count of dependencies: 23 (including punctuation as a token)

### Average Dependency Distance
The average dependency distance is calculated by dividing the total distances by the number of tokens (23):

- Average = Total distances / Count of dependencies = 30 / 23 ≈ 1.30

### Final Result
The average dependency distance for the given sentence is approximately **1.30**.
