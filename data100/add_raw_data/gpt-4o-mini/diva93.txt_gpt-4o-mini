To calculate the average dependency distance for the provided sentence, we first identify the tokens and their dependencies. 

### Sentence Breakdown
Tokens:
1. However
2. ,
3. VIP
4. make
5. it
6. possible
7. to
8. reduce
9. the
10. thickness
11. of
12. the
13. building
14. envelope
15. and
16. you
17. can
18. thereby
19. increase
20. the
21. area
22. for
23. selling
24. with
25. increased
26. income
27. as
28. a
29. result
30. .

### Dependency Mapping 
Let's consider the dependency relationships:
- "However" → (0 distance, as it often doesn't have a head in certain contexts)
- "," → (1 distance to "However")
- "VIP" → (1 distance to "make")
- "make" → (0 distance, as main verb)
- "it" → (1 distance to "make")
- "possible" → (1 distance to "make")
- "to" → (1 distance to "possible")
- "reduce" → (1 distance to "to")
- "the" (before "thickness") → (1 distance to "thickness")
- "thickness" → (1 distance to "reduce")
- "of" → (1 distance to "thickness")
- "the" (before "building") → (1 distance to "building")
- "building" → (1 distance to "envelope")
- "envelope" → (1 distance to "reduce")
- "and" → (0 distance, as a conjunction)
- "you" → (1 distance to "can")
- "can" → (1 distance to "make")
- "thereby" → (1 distance to "increase")
- "increase" → (1 distance to "make")
- "the" (before "area") → (1 distance to "area")
- "area" → (1 distance to "increase")
- "for" → (1 distance to "area")
- "selling" → (1 distance to "for")
- "with" → (1 distance to "income")
- "increased" → (1 distance to "income")
- "income" → (1 distance to "increase")
- "as" → (1 distance to "result")
- "a" → (1 distance to "result")
- "result" → (1 distance to "as")
- "." → (2 distance to "result")

### Total Dependency Distances Calculation
Now we tally the distances:
- Total distances: 1 (,) + 1 (VIP) + 1 (it) + 1 (possible) + 1 (to) + 1 (reduce) + 1 (the) + 1 (thickness) + 1 (of) + 1 (the) + 1 (building) + 1 (envelope) + 0 (and) + 1 (you) + 1 (can) + 1 (thereby) + 1 (increase) + 1 (the) + 1 (area) + 1 (for) + 1 (selling) + 1 (with) + 1 (increased) + 1 (income) + 1 (as) + 1 (a) + 1 (result) + 2 (.) = 27 distances.

### Average Dependency Distance Calculation
The number of tokens is 30. Thus, the average dependency distance (sum of distances/total number of tokens) is:
\[ \text{Average Dependency Distance} = \frac{27}{30} = 0.9 \]

### Conclusion
The average dependency distance for the provided sentence is approximately **0.9**.
