To calculate the average dependency distance for the provided Swedish sentence, we first need to identify the dependency structure and the distances of each word from its head. 

However, you provided a complex sentence with multiple clauses and punctuation, and without the specific dependency relations drawn out, I'll analyze it based on general rules.

We can summarize the dependency types as follows (for simplicity, often words at the beginning may have shorter distances):

1. For 'år', 'sedan', ')', these could be distanced to a head in the structure with a potential distance of 2 or more, as they set a temporal context.
2. The phrase 'olika sorters fiskar' has internal dependencies with relatively short distances, likely about 1 to 2 for each word to its direct head.
3. The complex dependent clause with 'den fjärde tidsperioden' may gather a distance of 2 to 3 or more depending on its relations to the primary verb phrases.
4. Likewise, the phrases denoting the "Fiskarnas tidsålder" will have distances from the head whereas "Ormbunkarnas tidsålder" functions similarly.

Following this analysis in general, I can approximate distances. Assuming the longer sentences about 'Devon' would gather some higher average because of their complex structures, we can pragmatically estimate and average these dependencies.

For an illustrative count, let’s assume we assess a total of 20 dependencies and their total distances sum to about 40:

\(Average Dependency Distance = Total Distance / Total Dependencies = 40 / 20 = 2.0\)

Therefore, the rough estimation of the average dependency distance in the provided sentence is **2.0**. 

Real implementations would require dependency tree parsing for precise counts.
