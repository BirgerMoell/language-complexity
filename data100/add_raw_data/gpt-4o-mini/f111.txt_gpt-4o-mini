To calculate the average dependency distance for the sentence "Vilket tidigare motsvarade att man fick ägna timmar kanske dagar åt att läsa igenom rad efter rad för att hitta vad man sökte," we first need to analyze the dependencies.

1. **Identify the structure**: The first step is to identify the head of each word and its dependent. For simplicity, let's consider the basic structure and dependencies:
   - "Vilket" → "motsvarade" (distance = 1)
   - "tidigare" → "motsvarade" (distance = 1)
   - "motsvarade" → "att" (distance = 1)
   - "man" → "fick" (distance = 1)
   - "fick" → "ägnade" (distance = 1)
   - "timmar" → "ägnade" (distance = 2)
   - "kanske" → "ägnade" (distance = 1)
   - "dagar" → "ägnade" (distance = 2)
   - "åt" → "läsa" (distance = 1)
   - "att" → "läsa" (distance = 1)
   - "läsa" → "igenom" (distance = 1)
   - "rad" → "hitta" (distance = 4)
   - "efter" → "rad" (distance = 1)
   - "rad" → "hitta" (distance = 4)
   - "för" → "hitta" (distance = 3)
   - "att" → "hitta" (distance = 2)
   - "vad" → "sökte" (distance = 1)
   - "man" → "sökte" (distance = 1)
   - "sökte" is the main verb and serves as the central head.

2. **Calculate distances**: Based on the identified distances from each dependent to its head, we will sum the distances and count the number of dependencies.

Here is the summary of the distances:
- Count: 15 dependencies
- Sum of distances: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 25

3. **Calculate average distance**: The average dependency distance is calculated as the total distance divided by the number of dependencies.

Average Dependency Distance = Total Distance / Number of Dependencies = 25 / 16 = 1.56 (approximately)

Thus, the average dependency distance for the provided Swedish sentence is about **1.56**.
