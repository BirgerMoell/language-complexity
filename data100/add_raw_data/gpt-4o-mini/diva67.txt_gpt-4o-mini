To calculate the average dependency distance for the given sentence "The number of experts responsible for different parts of the design should, however, be kept to a minimum," we first need to identify the distanced dependencies between each word and their heads.

1. **Dependency Distances:**
   - "The" (distance to "number") = 1
   - "number" (distance to "be") = 6
   - "of" (distance to "number") = 1
   - "experts" (distance to "number") = 2
   - "responsible" (distance to "experts") = 1
   - "for" (distance to "responsible") = 1
   - "different" (distance to "parts") = 1
   - "parts" (distance to "for") = 2
   - "of" (distance to "design") = 3
   - "the" (distance to "design") = 1
   - "design" (distance to "kept") = 4
   - "should" (distance to "kept") = 1
   - "however" (distance to "kept") = 2
   - "be" (distance to "kept") = 1
   - "kept" (distance to "minimum") = 3
   - "to" (distance to "minimum") = 1
   - "a" (distance to "minimum") = 1
   - "minimum" = 0 (it's the final word and does not have a head)

2. **Total distance calculation:**
   We sum up all the dependency distances:
   1 + 6 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 34

3. **Count of dependent tokens:**
   We count all the tokens excluding the main verb and including any punctuation marks. The tokens amount to 17.

4. **Average Dependency Distance:**
   The average dependency distance is calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Average Dependency Distance} = \frac{\text{Total Dependency Distances}}{\text{Number of Dependencies}} = \frac{34}{17} = 2.0
   \]

Therefore, the average dependency distance for the provided Swedish sentence is **2.0**.
