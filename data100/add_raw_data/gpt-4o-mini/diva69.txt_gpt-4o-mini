To analyze the given Swedish sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we'll first break down the sentence into its components and identify the dependency relationships. The relevant sentence for calculation is:

"Under tidigare delen av 1960-talet var det akut bostadskris i Sverige."

1. **Dependency Relationships**:
   - "Under" (head verb) → 1 (distance from "Under" to "del")
   - "tidigare" → 1 (to "del")
   - "delen" → 1 (to "var")
   - "av" (prep) → 2 (to "del")
   - "1960-talet" → 1 (to "av")
   - "var" (head verb) → 0 (itself)
   - "det" → 1 (to "var")
   - "akut" → 1 (to "bostadskris")
   - "bostadskris" → 1 (to "var")
   - "i" (prep) → 2 (to "bostadskris")
   - "Sverige" → 1 (to "i")

2. **Calculating Distances**:
   - From "Under" to "delen": 1
   - From "tidigare" to "delen": 1
   - From "delen" to "var": 1
   - From "av" to "delen": 2
   - From "1960-talet" to "av": 1
   - From "var" to itself: 0
   - From "det" to "var": 1
   - From "akut" to "bostadskris": 1
   - From "bostadskris" to "var": 1
   - From "i" to "bostadskris": 2
   - From "Sverige" to "i": 1

3. **Distance Totals**:
   - Total dependency distances = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 12
   - Number of words (tokens) = 11

4. **Average Dependency Distance**:
   \[
   \text{Average Dependency Distance} = \frac{\text{Total Dependency Distances}}{\text{Number of Words}} = \frac{12}{11} \approx 1.09
   \]

Thus, the average dependency distance for the sentence is approximately **1.09**.
