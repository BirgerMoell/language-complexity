To analyze the sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we first need to identify the tokens and their corresponding dependency distances.

1. **Tokenization**:
   The sentence is: "Rising costs of energy, combined with an increasing environmental consciousness on the part of building owners, render timely the law on certification of buildings for energy efficiency."
   
   Here are the tokens, including punctuation:
   - Rising
   - costs
   - of
   - energy
   - ,
   - combined
   - with
   - an
   - increasing
   - environmental
   - consciousness
   - on
   - the
   - part
   - of
   - building
   - owners
   - ,
   - render
   - timely
   - the
   - law
   - on
   - certification
   - of
   - buildings
   - for
   - energy
   - efficiency
   - .

2. **Dependency Relationships**:
   Next, we establish the dependencies in the sentence:
   - "Rising" depends on "costs"
   - "costs" depends on "render"
   - "of" depends on "costs"
   - "energy" depends on "of"
   - "combined" depends on "render"
   - "with" depends on "combined"
   - "an" depends on "environmental consciousness"
   - "increasing" depends on "consciousness"
   - "environmental" depends on "consciousness"
   - "consciousness" depends on "render"
   - "on" depends on "consciousness"
   - "the" depends on "part"
   - "part" depends on "on"
   - "of" depends on "part"
   - "building" depends on "of"
   - "owners" depends on "building"
   - "render" depends on "timely"
   - "the" depends on "law"
   - "law" depends on "render"
   - "on" depends on "law"
   - "certification" depends on "on"
   - "of" depends on "certification"
   - "buildings" depends on "of"
   - "for" depends on "buildings"
   - "energy" depends on "for"
   - "efficiency" depends on "energy"
   - "." depends on "render"

3. **Calculating Distances**:
   Using the dependencies, we calculate the distance of each token from its head:
   - Rising (1)
   - costs (1)
   - of (2)
   - energy (3)
   - , (3)
   - combined (2)
   - with (3)
   - an (6)
   - increasing (5)
   - environmental (6)
   - consciousness (3)
   - on (4)
   - the (7)
   - part (3)
   - of (4)
   - building (5)
   - owners (6)
   - , (5)
   - render (0)
   - timely (1)
   - the (3)
   - law (2)
   - on (3)
   - certification (4)
   - of (5)
   - buildings (6)
   - for (6)
   - energy (7)
   - efficiency (8)
   - . (6)

4. **Calculate Total Distance and Average**:
   Sum of distances: 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 5 + 6 + 3 + 4 + 7 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 5 + 0 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 104.

   Total number of relations (tokens that have a dependency): 30 tokens.

   Average distance = Total distance / Number of dependencies = 104 / 30 = 3.47.

Therefore, the average dependency distance for the given sentence is **3.47**.
