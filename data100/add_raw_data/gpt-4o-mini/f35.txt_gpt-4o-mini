To calculate the average dependency distance for the given Swedish sentence, we first identify the tokens and their respective heads, as well as their dependency distances.

The sentence is:
"Delarna sätter man in i så kallade I/O-portar (In/Out-portar), och desto fler sådana man har, desto fler grafikkort och ljudkort m."

Let's break down the dependencies:
1. "Delarna" → "sätter" (distance = 1)
2. "man" → "sätter" (distance = 1)
3. "in" → "sätter" (distance = 2)
4. "i" → "in" (distance = 1)
5. "så" → "kallade" (distance = 1)
6. "kallade" → "portar" (distance = 1)
7. "I/O-portar" → "kallade" (distance = 2)
8. "(In/Out-portar)" → "I/O-portar" (distance = 1)
9. "och" → "sätter" (distance = 5) (assuming "och" connects to the nearest verb, which is "sätter")
10. "desto" → "fler" (distance = 1)
11. "fler" → "har" (distance = 2)
12. "sådana" → "fler" (distance = 1)
13. "man" → "har" (distance = 2)
14. "har" → "fler" (distance = 2)
15. "desto" → "fler" (distance = 1)
16. "fler" → "grafikkort" (distance = 1)
17. "grafikkort" → "och" (distance = 1)
18. "ljudkort" → "och" (distance = 1)
19. "m." → "ljudkort" (distance = 3) (assuming "m." connects to the last token)

Now we sum the distances:
1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 =  30

Next, we count the number of tokens (including punctuation):
There are 19 tokens in total.

Finally, we calculate the average dependency distance:
Average dependency distance = Total distance / Number of tokens 
= 30 / 19 
≈ 1.58

Thus, the average dependency distance for the sentence is approximately **1.58**.
