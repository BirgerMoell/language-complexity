To analyze the sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we first need to determine the individual dependencies based on a typical dependency parse. Let's break down the sentence:

**Sentence:** "Furthermore, a work sampling was carried out and the content of work in the workstations which were earlier identified as bottlenecks were observed."

1. **Dependencies:**
   - "Furthermore," to "was" (distance = 2)
   - "a" to "sampling" (distance = 1)
   - "work" to "sampling" (distance = 1)
   - "sampling" to "was" (distance = 1)
   - "carried" to "was" (distance = 1)
   - "out" to "carried" (distance = 1)
   - "and" to "was" (distance = 2)
   - "the" to "content" (distance = 1)
   - "content" to "were" (distance = 2)
   - "of" to "content" (distance = 1)
   - "work" to "of" (distance = 1)
   - "in" to "workstations" (distance = 1)
   - "the" to "workstations" (distance = 1)
   - "which" to "workstations" (distance = 1)
   - "were" to "which" (distance = 1)
   - "earlier" to "identified" (distance = 1)
   - "identified" to "workstations" (distance = 2)
   - "as" to "identified" (distance = 1)
   - "bottlenecks" to "as" (distance = 1)
   - "observed" to "were" (distance = 1)

2. **Count of distances:**
   - Distances: 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1.

3. **Sum of distances:** 
   - Total distance = 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 21.

4. **Number of tokens:** 
   - The total number of tokens in the sentence is 21 (including punctuation).

5. **Average dependency distance:**
   - Average = Total distance / Number of tokens = 21 / 20 = 1.05.

Thus, the average dependency distance for the given sentence is **1.05**.
