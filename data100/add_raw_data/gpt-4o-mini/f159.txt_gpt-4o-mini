To calculate the average dependency distance for the given Swedish sentence "I Atlanten lever ca 1 500 olika djurarter medan det i Östersjön bara finns ca 80,", we first need to identify the dependency relations and their distances.

1. **Identify tokens and their dependencies**:
   - "I" (prep) -> "Atlanten" (noun): distance 1
   - "Atlanten" (noun) -> "lever" (verb): distance 2
   - "lever" (verb) -> "ca" (quantifier): distance 1
   - "ca" (quantifier) -> "1" (number): distance 1
   - "1" (number) -> "500" (number): distance 1
   - "500" (number) -> "olika" (adj): distance 1
   - "olika" (adj) -> "djurarter" (noun): distance 1
   - "djurarter" (noun) -> "medan" (conj): distance 1
   - "medan" (conj) -> "det" (pronoun): distance 2
   - "det" (pronoun) -> "i" (prep): distance 1
   - "i" (prep) -> "Östersjön" (noun): distance 1
   - "Östersjön" (noun) -> "bara" (adv): distance 1
   - "bara" (adv) -> "finns" (verb): distance 1
   - "finns" (verb) -> "ca" (quantifier): distance 1
   - "ca" (quantifier) -> "80" (number): distance 1
   - "80" (number) -> "," (punct): distance 1

2. **Calculate total distances**:
   - Total distances from each token to its head:
     - "I": 1
     - "Atlanten": 2
     - "lever": 1
     - "ca" (1st): 1
     - "1": 1
     - "500": 1
     - "olika": 1
     - "djurarter": 1
     - "medan": 1
     - "det": 2
     - "i": 1
     - "Östersjön": 1
     - "bara": 1
     - "finns": 1
     - "ca" (2nd): 1
     - "80": 1
     - ",": 1

3. **Sum up the distances**:
   - Total distance = 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 18

4. **Count the number of tokens**:
   - Total number of tokens = 16

5. **Calculate average dependency distance**:
   - Average dependency distance = Total distance / Number of tokens = 18 / 16 = 1.125

Thus, the average dependency distance for the sentence is **1.125**.
