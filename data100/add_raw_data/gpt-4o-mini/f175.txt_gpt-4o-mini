To calculate the average dependency distance for the given Swedish sentence, we first need to identify the syntactic structure and the distances of each dependent word from its head.

The sentence is:
"Är vätskan varm, späd lite i sänder under omrörning och låt redningen koka upp mellan varje spädning."

1. **Tokenizing the sentence:**
   - ÄR (head of the main clause, dependent for "vätskan" and "varm")
   - VÄTSKAN (subject of the main clause)
   - VARM (subject complement)
   - COMMA (,)
   - SPÄD (head of the imperatives following)
   - LITE (modifier of "späd")
   - I (preposition for "sänder")
   - SÄNDER (object of the preposition)
   - UNDER (preposition for "omrörning")
   - OMRÖRNING (object of the preposition)
   - OCH (coordinating conjunction)
   - LÅT (imperative, head of the second clause)
   - REDNINGEN (subject of "låta")
   - KOKA (complement of "låta")
   - UPP (particle)
   - MELLAN (preposition for "spädning")
   - VARJE (modifier of "spädning")
   - SPÄDNING (object of the preposition)

2. **Mapping out distances:**
   - For "Är" (head) -> "vätskan": distance = 1
   - For "Är" (head) -> "varm": distance = 2
   - For  ",": distance = 0 (punctuation has no dependency distance)
   - For "späd" (head) -> "lite": distance = 1
   - For "späd" (head) -> "i": distance = 2
   - For "i" (head) -> "sänder": distance = 1
   - For "under" (head) -> "omrörning": distance = 1
   - For "låta" (head) -> "redningen": distance = 1
   - For "låta" (head) -> "koka": distance = 1
   - For "koka" (head) -> "upp": distance = 1
   - For "mellan" (head) -> "varje": distance = 1
   - For "mellan" (head) -> "spädning": distance = 1
   
3. **Calculating total distance:**
   - Total distance = 1 (from vätskan) + 2 (from varm) + 0 (for comma) + 1 (from lite) + 2 (from i) + 1 (from sänder) + 1 (from omrörning) + 1 (from redningen) + 1 (from koka) + 1 (from upp) + 1 (from varje) + 1 (from spädning)
   - Total distance = 12

4. **Counting total tokens:**
   - Total tokens = 14

5. **Calculating average dependency distance:**
   - Average dependency distance = Total Distance / Total Tokens = 12 / 14 ≈ 0.857

Thus, the average dependency distance for the given sentence is approximately **0.857**.
