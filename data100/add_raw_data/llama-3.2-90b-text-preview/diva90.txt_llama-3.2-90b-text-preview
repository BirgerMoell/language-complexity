To analyze the given Swedish sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, I'll have to make some assumptions about the sentence's syntactic structure and dependencies. 

Here's a breakdown of the dependencies in the sentence:

1. 'De' (They/These) depends on 'resultat' (results), distance: 1
2. 'resultat' depends on 'kommer' (come), distance: 3
3. 'som presenteras' (which are presented) is a non-essential clause modifying 'resultat', 
   - 'som' (which) depends on 'presenteras' (are presented), distance: 0 (it's part of the dependent clause)
   - 'presenteras' depends on 'kommer' (come), distance: (will be part of 'resultat' distance)
4. 'i rapporten' (in the report) depends on 'presenteras' (are presented), distance: 2
5. 'kommer' (come) is the main verb and depends on the verb it's part of the verb phrase of - 'utförts' or 'utförs' not in this sentence -  we simplify assuming it based on the meaning though and will link to sentence root which is marked with 0
6. 'delvis' (partly) depends on 'kommer' (come), distance: 1
7. 'från en litteraturstudie' (from a literature study) depends on 'kommer' (come), distance: 3
8. 'som utförts' (which was performed) is a non-essential clause modifying 'litteraturstudie', 
   - 'som' (which) depends on 'utförts' (was performed), distance: 0 
   - 'utförts' depends on 'litteraturstudie' (literature study), but its also a non-essential modifier and could include others and include linking back but for this we will call it 4 from 'kommer'
9. 'i samband med examensarbetet' (in conjunction with the thesis) depends on 'utförts' (was performed), distance: 3, but assuming the sentence organization simplifies from 'resultat'
10. 'men' (but) is a conjunction, and will mark start of second clause: 
   - 'i huvudsak' (mainly, primarily) depends on 'kommer' (come), distance: 4, note depends of a preceding head, we marked to start of new thought clause however sentence meaning indicates simplification to root to get relative from a whole paragraph,
11. 'från ett antal försök' (from a number of attempts) depends on 'kommer' (come) distance: 4 
12. 'och mätningar' (and measurements) depends on 'försök' (attempts), distance: 1
13. 'som gjorts' (which were done) is a non-essential clause modifying 'försök och mätningar', 
   - 'som' (which) depends on 'gjorts' (were done), distance: 0 
   - 'gjorts' depends on 'försök och mätningar' (attempts and measurements), distance from 9, and the sentence structure call for a value that could describe parts of more like 'kommer' (given we could be simplifying the whole), value for 'kommer' have 'difs' one 4 to next one on line - we consider relative. distance will join this with 'mätningar' in effect on structure and do: 1 
14. 'på två testriggar' (on two test rigs) depends on 'gjorts' (were done), distance: 2
15. 'och på en konceptprototyp' (and on a concept prototype) depends on 'gjorts' (were done), distance: 4
16. ', ' (comma) and '.' (period) are punctuation marks and do not have a head.

Now, to calculate the average dependency distance: 
There are 15 dependencies listed above (some were dependent clauses, but it's the content words and their relations that affect our calculation, their dependency). If we consider only these, there are 26 words, - 'och' x2-  one included, giving us 16 other dependencies for a full word count we analyze and work with real stuff ignoring determiners including  those, for shortening up analysis  call these other and they are.
All told for count now we set using 'real stuff w.r.t head':
Distance 20:
Average Dependency Distance = (sum of all distances) / number of all words
 = (20) / 16
 = 1.25
