To analyze the given Swedish sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we need to identify the tokens, their dependency relationships, and then calculate the distance.

The tokens in the sentence are:

1. För
2. att
3. dimensionera
4. denna
5. bypassventil
6. inför
7. tillverkning
8. samt
9. för
10. att
11. undersöka
12. bypassventilens
13. inverkan
14. på
15. motorn
16. utfördes
17. simuleringar
18. i
19. GT-Power
20. .

Now, let's analyze the dependency relationships:

- För (1) is a preposition with the head 'inför' (6) at a distance of 5
- att (2) is a subordinating conjunction with the head 'dimensionera' (3) at a distance of 1
- dimensionera (3) is a verb with the head 'utfördes' (16) at a distance of not direct; for simplicity we'll use 'att'-'dimensionera'-'inför '– 'utfördes'.
- denna (4) is an adjective with the head 'bypassventil' (5) at a distance of 1
- bypassventil (5) is a noun with the head 'dimensionera' (3) at a distance of not direct; for simplicity we'll use 'att'-'dimensionera'-'inför '– 'bypassventil'.
- inför (6) is a preposition with the head 'utfördes' (16) at a distance of not direct; for simplicity we'll use 'att'-'dimensionera'-'bypassventil'– 'utfördes'.
- tillverkning (7) is a noun that seems dependent on 'inför' at a distance of 1 
- samt (8) is a coordinating conjunction with the head 'samt'— 'utfördesGuidId=2 ' För at ' 'f '17 satt
 9' För't7; för simplicity we'll use 1 ('utfördes'.
- För (9) is a preposition with the head 'att' (10) at a distance of 1 
- att (10) is a subordinating conjunction with the head 'utfördes' (16) at a distance of 4 
- undersöka (11) is a verb with the head 'utfördes' (16) at a distance of 4 
- bypassventilens (12) is a possessive noun with the head 'undersöka' (11) at a distance of 1 
- inverkan (13) is a noun with the head 'undersöka' (11) at a distance of not direct; for simplicity we'll use 'undersöka-bypassventilens'
- på (14) is a preposition with the head 'inverkan' at a distance of 1 
- motorn (15) is a noun that seems dependent on 'på' at a distance of 1 
- utfördes (16) is a verb; not necessary as the distance is '0'.
- simuleringar (17) is a noun with the head 'utfördes' (16) at a distance of 1.
- i (18) is a preposition with the head 'utfördes' (16) at a distance of not direct; for simplicity we'll use 2 (see first example, calculating "köper-en"). 
- GT-Power (19) is a noun that seems dependent on 'i' at a distance of 1.
- ' . ' is an ending punctuation. Not necessary as the distance is 1 

So the average dependency distance is 
   sum of all the dependency: (5 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 4+ 1 + 3+1+5 + 3 + 4+ 1+ 1+ 2+ 1+ 1)/ 19 ≈ 2.26 
We also here took calculated both those simple and complex relationships.
