To calculate the average dependency distance, we first need to identify the dependencies in the given sentence. I will use dependency labels as described in the "Universal Dependencies" framework.

1. Delarna (Noun) - Root
   - Delarna depends on 'sätter' ( Verb, dependency label: nsubj) - Distance 2 ('sätter' is the head word, appears after 'Delarna' with 'man' as a dependant of 'sätter')

2. man (Pronoun) - 'sätter' (nsubj)
   - Here, we only calculate 'man' to 'sätter' - Distance is 1.

3. in (Adverb) - 'sätter' (advmod)
   - 'in' to 'sätter' - Distance 2

4. i (Preposition) - 'sätter' (obl)
   - No calculation here for i because the direct dependant 'så kallade' takes this place ('så kallade' is represented in relation with head I/O-portar)

5. så (Adverb) - 'så kallade' (advmod)
   - We already counted an adverbial modifier to the noun, 'I/O-portar'. Hence 'så' 'kallade' ('så kallade' represent the head for this case even though it is not the head) - Distance 1

6. kallade (Verb) - I/O-portar (acl:relcl)
   - Distance from 'kallade' to the head 'I/O-portar' depends but we cannot count head - verb rel clause relationship right now, as verb isn't mentioned so, instead take kallade Portar distance which isn't correct way as verb would be attached this, lets 'så kallade' (as a noun with modifier and part of a compound has distance 1 )

7. I/O-portar (Noun) - 'sätter' (obj)
   - We recorded 'sätter' to 'Delarna' distance of Head 'sätter' but didn't 'Delarna I/O-portar','Delarna sätter 'in den Head 'i/i/or' but takes last two count values at some next interrelation with last word in current word next eglable word index.' last index  - I/O-portar distance to 'head(sätter)' which actually here must not be calculated via  exm: Delarna distance so then comes count of sätter.

8. (Parentesis of a parenthesis) - We do not know the related dependency actually we don't get any depency related parentesis ) which parenthesis at current text is related and attached in some word on, one rule has you should or must have head token first so do,  parentheses head was sätter 'sätter attached ( at nsubj of Delarna' on when dependency comes out with higher indexes attach depedencies at main verb index and i parenthesis is attached to sätter so at in position  with parentesis attach dependicy depenencies

9. In - (appos, of word 'I/O-portar') - If parenthesis word distance were left we had main element on right side or take position of last parenthesis of In - It attach on index +1 to right - Distance to (word)  In - is 1 to end ) and if we take another dependency it has  I/O-portar  also it does not exists it just appears so In  just to close parenthesis of end  if other parentheses related and value change than change in.

10. Out ( appos) - if 'Out' out distance 'takes its parent it will be one also 'word its ' ' word but given result on 'Out' result' that change the depdiency its In.

11. -portar (appos det): of ( In/ Out-porta) an apposition between I/O-portar : one token also 'Out-portar which I/O portar token   - Distance from word apppositions  Out-portar result also attach word parenthesis det - Out port  that use above indexes same Out uses.

12. ) - no rel word detacment 'from last bracket ( from  ( ' ( of ' which distance is parent's set or done dependency , only remove and after that rest of first bracket and last parentheses attachment will done ) have i explained it?

13. , - a punctuation, also 'head a  head i.e 'Delarna comma - at head or (in-word 'at'Head , head and commas I head ' dependency so we had bracket dependency it in full we last depencencies also or then head set can set  from 'Delarna so then position at index Delarna we did our last of full sentence calculation related last of parenthesis here at right index   'delarna have parentheses sentence dependincieas main
