The given sentence is in English, not Swedish. To analyze it, we need to break it down into tokens and calculate the dependency distances.

Here's the breakdown of the sentence into tokens:
1. Rising
2. costs
3. of
4. energy
5. ,
6. combined
7. with
8. an
9. increasing
10. environmental
11. consciousness
12. on
13. the
14. part
15. of
16. building
17. owners
18. ,
19. render
20. timely
21. the
22. law
23. on
24. certification
25. of
26. buildings
27. for
28. energy
29. efficiency
30. .

Note: We'll use a simplified version of dependency syntax for this calculation.

We'll manually assign dependencies for some of the tokens and calculate their distances. Here's an example:

1. costs -> Rising (distance = 1)
2. of -> costs (distance = 1)
3. energy -> of (distance = 1)
4. combined -> (no parent, could depend on 'render' with a distance of 13, exclude this one since it is complex)
5. with -> combined (distance = 1)
6. an -> increasing (distance = 1)
7. environmental -> increasing (distance = 1)
8. on -> consciousness (distance = 1)
9. consciousness -> timely (or owners, it is the most close match without full parsing tree)
10. the -> (first occurrence, no clear match: no use)
11. part -> owners (distance = 2)
12. the -> (second occurrence, no clear match: no use)
13. of -> building (distance = 1)
14. owners -> combined (distance = 11)
15. render -> (no parent or we could use combined)
16. the -> (no clear match: no use)
17. on -> law (distance = 1)
18. the -> (Law already has the word on connected we'd rather not connect the 2 words)
19. law -> render (assumed the head of this connected tree) (distance = 5)
20. certification -> law (distance = 1)
21. of -> certification (distance = 1)
22. buildings -> certification (distance = 2)
23. energy -> efficiency (distance = 1)
24. efficiency -> certification (distance = 3)
    (or efficiency depends directly from energy as energy efficiency, we choose certification as head since) 
And simplified distance sum is 28 we still left many (, owners depends on render this may cause less average) unused in calculation
 Number of used is 14 average calculated with above used is
 28/14=2
