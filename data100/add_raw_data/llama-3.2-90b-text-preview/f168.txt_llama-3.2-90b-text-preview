1. år
2. sedan
3. (
4. )
5. och
6. olika
7. sorters
8. fiskar
9. –
10. Lungfeniga
11. &
12. Kvastfeniga
13. <
14. se
15. sidan
16. 25,
17. arternas
18. utveckling
19. människans
20. urtid
21. schema
22. >
23. Devon
24. är
25. den
26. fjärde
27. tidsperioden
28. under
29. forntiden
30. och
31. kallas
32. för
33. Fiskarnas
34. tidsålder
35. "
36. och
37. under
38. den
39. senare
40. Devonperioden
41. också
42. för
43. Ormbunkarnas
44. tidsålder

Representing the dependencies:

1. "år" is under "sedan" (distance: 1)
2. "sedan" has no direct head (dependent on the entire clause)
3. "och" is under "sedan" (distance: 2)
4. ")" has no clear head (dependent on the entire clause)
5. Note: I will treat punctuation marks like ")" as dependent on the entire clause

24. "är" is under "kallas" (distance: 7)
