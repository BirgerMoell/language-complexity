To calculate the average dependency distance for the given sentence, I will first identify the dependencies. Please note that this analysis relies on basic understanding of Swedish sentence structure, but might not be perfect, especially in a complex sentence like this one.

1. 'Mamma' is an apposition of 'Lisa', so 'Mamma' is dependent on 'Lisa'. Distance: 1
2. 'Lisa' is the subject of 'tar'. Distance: 3 (from 'Lisa' to 'Mamma', and then 'Mamma Lisa' is 3 positions away from 'tar').
3. 'picknick-korgen' is the direct object of 'tar'. Distance: 1 (from 'picknick-korgen' to the comma, but 'picknick-korgen' is the direct object, so the comma is not included in the distance).
4. 'Tojt' is the subject of 'bär'. Distance: 2
5. 'två stora filtar' is the direct object of 'bär'. Distance: 2
   - 'två' is an adjective dependent on 'filtar'. Distance: 2 (within the phrase 'två stora filtar')
   - 'stora' is an adjective dependent on 'filtar'. Distance: 1 (within the phrase 'två stora filtar')
6. 'att sitta på' is a prepositional phrase dependent on 'bär'. Distance: 2
   - 'att' is a marker dependent on 'sitta'. Distance: 1
   - 'sitta' is the main verb of the phrase 'att sitta på'. Distance: 1
   - 'på' is a preposition dependent on 'sitta'. Distance: 1
7. 'och' is a coordinating conjunction, we ignore its contributing distance but it must be included in the calculation as it moves words away.
8. 'Bojt' is the subject of the verb 'får'. Distance: 1
9. 'får' is dependent on 'bära'. Distance: 6 (very distant dependency due to the long phrase and subordinating conjunction).
10. 'att bära metspöna' is an infinitive dependent on 'får'. Distance: 2 (ignoring internals for this simplified explanation).
   - 'att' is a marker dependent on 'bära'. Distance: 1
   - 'bära' is the main verb of the phrase 'bära metspöna'. Distance: 2 
   - 'metspöna' is the direct object of 'bära'. Distance: 1
11. 'pappa' is an indirect object dependent on 'får'. Distance: 2
   - 'att' is a marker dependent on 'hjälpa'. Distance: 1
12. 'hjälpa' is a dependent verb for the action chain on 'pappa', dependent on 'får'. Distance: 4 
13. 'att' is a marker dependent on 'bära' within 'att bära metspöna', already included in previous calculation
14. The last 'att' (from 'att bära metspöna') can be also re-used from dependency 10.

Average distance = total dependency distance / number of dependencies. Ignoring the coordination 'och', calculating the distances the main relation is calculated as:

(1 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 4) / 20 ≈ 44/20 = 2.2
