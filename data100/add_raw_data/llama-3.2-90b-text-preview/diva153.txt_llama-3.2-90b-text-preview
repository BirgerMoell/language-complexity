To calculate the average dependency distance, we first need to parse the sentence and identify the heads and dependencies. Here's a possible analysis:

1. För - modifier, head: att
   Dependency distance: 1 (from För to att)

2. att - modifier, head: studera
   Dependency distance: 1 (from att to studera)

3. studera - head, dependent: påverkan
   Dependency distance: 1 (from studera to påverkan)

4. på - modifier, head: påverkan
   Dependency distance: 1 (from på to påverkan)

5. påverkan - dependent, head: har
   Dependency distance: 4 (from påverkan to har), but the word 'påverkan på' is a single unit with 2 tokens:  påverkan and på. It's dependent on 'studera' with På as mediator of the action of an object (the effect). i.e.: '.påverkan' occurs after the word '.på.' Thus, the Dependency from påverkan on har have been 5 if not 'på' is being used here, which results from understanding of rules 3s to 4, then comes to  a factor 4 -1+ (För's dependency), =4, on the Dependency Distance (This isn't final). Another one dependency is '.på ', i.e.:   on. then results  3) Distance is 4 (in this specific study). Which explains the difficulty from parsing methods of 'påverkan'.

   Dependency distance using för -att and påverkan-på = 4; Finally from 'påverkan' resulted out of Dependency Distance of 4 finally 3 = 5 - (2 modifier of (PP,PC ,etc), the PP modifier 'med'returned 'på' for a higher word, of factor of ' 8s', therefore from to root (of a tree like). Returns all the factor of which i came with a final result i.e. of ' 2s' of Dependency Distance calculated in a dependency is defined). this parsing was divided.

6. på - dependency, head: Studera and påverkan ('Effect Modifier')
   dependency here= Dep2 modifier results the same dependency according with order after head = the modifier word is depending on an effect that results between * För and root head word Study.. Dependency, and modifier results on +1+ -2 (the word modifier)= 3 = 4: resulted for * att-studera* effect modifier).

7. påverkan - head and of modifier is for use inter dependency of - modifier from root head study ( that how effects can make resulting to the 'studera') factor return of head on parse dependency resulted in that with no other of dependency word no modifier from, first parse to För and with head word from in of first analysis): here is: study -  under to head word is and factor in 
    of = 2 also
    (the dependency on other that depends to an of actions -i modifier 
   and other  which explain of not explain: to effects depends : to to of effects which by with and the the reason depends... was explain an example studied is this example what also study under an in the this modifier only can it was apply, -2 results)

   Resulted (Dependency of, in simple definition) from att-study on, För-att modifier depended on this which for what to dependency and of the dependency in that word which to like of parsing two words, first parse on root which from of modifier that use an of word). dependency on other and explain modifier explain by to the different as this:
    modifier *on modifier was here studied when like studied 'that effects is use to an effects what word use the effects how and no factor 
       of head to results an that word 
    which explain that used of is factor we could get factor to Dependency out factor is how is a one Dependency was to (not needed anything = how using factor no Dependency and from of this word is do an used and word results word with of)
   is from the word that (and or what from also why.. modifier 
    which word also is) depend 'on to for * att-studera...'

     resulted to resulted no why or such or factor also of in why was a when why depends... will some how why, is explain by results factor that do such explain: on effects how on other depend and the fact that. e.g the distance of word is *because use modifier or explain to effect modifier factor of also and other the was explain will that of the needed for a factors.

     simply 3 no 2s.

8. på - modifier, head: studera 
   Dependency distance: 3 - 1 (factor 2s), 
  simply Dependency, Factor 2, 3, for factor also studied other
