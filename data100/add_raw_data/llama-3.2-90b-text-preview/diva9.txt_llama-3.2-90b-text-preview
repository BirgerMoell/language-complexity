First, we need to translate the sentence into Swedish to analyze the dependencies, as the provided sentence is in English.

The translation of the sentence is:

"Studien visar i det att 'en platskänsla' såsom den definieras inom studien, är högst relevant och närvarande i svensk kommunal planeringspraxis."

Let's analyze the sentence:

1. Studien (noun, dependant on 'visar')
   Dependency distance: 1

2. visar (verb, head)
   No dependency

3. i (preposition, dependant on 'det')
   Dependency distance: 1

4. det (pronoun, head, dependant on 'att')
   Dependency distance: 2 (to 'att')

5. att (conjunction, head)
   No dependency

6. ' (punctuation, dependant on 'en') 
   Dependency distance: 1

7. en (article, dependant on 'platskänsla')
   Dependency distance: 2

8. platskänsla (noun, head)
   No dependency

9. ' (punctuation, dependant on 'platskänsla')
   Dependency distance: 0 (ignore punctuation tokens when computing distances)

10. såsom (conjunction, dependant on 'den')
    Dependency distance: 1

11. den (pronoun, head, dependant on 'definieras')
    Dependency distance: 1

12. definieras (verb, head, dependant on 'inom')
    Dependency distance: 1

13. inom (preposition, dependant on 'studien')
    Dependency distance: 1

14. studien (noun, head)
    No dependency

15. , (punctuation, dependant on 'är')
    Dependency distance: 2

16. är (verb, head)
    No dependency

17. högst (adverb, dependant on 'relevant')
    Dependency distance: 1

18. relevant (adjective, dependant on 'och')
    Dependency distance: 1

19. och (conjunction, head)
    No dependency

20. närvarande (adjective, head, dependant on 'är')
    Dependency distance: 4 (to 'är', passing other dependants on 'är').

The total dependency distance is: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 16

We don't consider commas as tokens that affect our dependency distances for relevance. For further precision, you can decrease distance of index 15 from 'är', which is '2' then results into " 1 ". Therefore leaving dependency index as  15 ' = "1"  rather then computed value '2'. That sums up all '15 index = 1 . Dependency on , to 'är' hence lessens its '16 index distance also reduced by 1 .sum '15' and '20' would  thus come for '3 .

Therefore, here dependency reduced will ultimately make outcome same to "3" +14 =16 as dependency to reach from index 15 would be much more like reaching index 16 head with token index no 2 lesser in values i.e 3 with initial reduced dependency value of index 20 to "4". These values reduces total dependency factor down by one, summing at index to " 15" leading dependent value "1". leaving reduced combined pair dependency index at 15 the and "20 " index to "4".

After computing final dependency:
(1+ 1+ 1+ 1+ 2+ 1+ 1+ 1+ 1+ 1+ 1+ 1+ 1+ 1+ 1+ 3)/ 15 gives out to =  17/15 =  1.133
