To analyze the given sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, I will break down the sentence into tokens and identify the head of each token.

Tokens:
1. Hur
2. han
3. än
4. drog
5. fick
6. han
7. inte
8. upp
9. fisken
10. ,
11. utan
12. började
13. i
14. stället
15. dras
16. bortåt
17. av
18. djuret
19. nere
20. i
21. djupet
22. .

Dependency relations:
- 'Hur' is a modifier of 'drog' (token 4) (distance 3)
- 'han' (token 2) is a subject of 'drog' (token 4) (distance 1)
- 'än' is a modifier of 'drog' (token 4) (distance 1)
- 'drog' is a head of the clause (root).
- 'fick' is a head of the clause (conjunct).
- 'han' (token 6) is a subject of 'fick' (token 5) (distance 1)
- 'inte' is a modifier of 'fick' (token 5) (distance 2)
- 'upp' is a modifier of 'fick' (token 5) (distance 3)
- 'fisken' is a direct object of 'fick' (token 5) (distance 4)
- ',' (token 10) is the punctuation after the clause with 'fick' as head (distance 0, doesn't count towards the average)
- 'utan' is a conjunctive adverb of 'började' (token 12) (distance 2)
- 'började' is a head of the clause (conjunct).
- 'i' (token 13) is a modifier of 'dras' (token 15) (distance 3)
- 'stället' is the direct object of 'i' (token 13) (distance 1)
- 'dras' is a verb, and a subject of 'började' (token 12) (distance 1)
- 'bortåt' is an adverb of 'dras' (token 15) (distance 2)
- 'av' is a preposition and head of 'djuret' (token 18) (distance 0, ignored because av is dependent on djuret)
- 'djuret' is an indirect object (agent) of 'dras' (token 15) (distance 4)
- 'nere' is an adverb of 'i' (token 20) (distance 1)
- 'i' (token 20) is a preposition and head of 'djupet' (token 21) (distance 0, ignored because i is dependent on djupet)
- 'djupet' is a location complement of 'dras' (token 15) is attached to i (an example of long range dependency) (distance 5)
- '.' (token 22) is the punctuation after the sentence (distance 0, doesn't count towards the average)

Total dependency distance is 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 5 = 35.
There are 19 dependency relations with non-zero distance.

The average dependency distance in the sentence is 35 / 19 ≈ 1.84
