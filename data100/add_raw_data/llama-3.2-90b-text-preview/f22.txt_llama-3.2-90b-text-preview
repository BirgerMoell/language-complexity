To analyze the sentence, we first need to identify the head words and their dependents. We'll use the Stanford Dependencies grammar framework for this example:

1. Föräldrarna (SUBJ) - sov (ROOT)
   Distance: 1

2. sov (ROOT) - i (PREP)
   Distance: 1

   i (PREP) - varsin (MOD, so 'varsin säng')
   Distance from 'i': 1
   i (PREP) - säng (PMOD)
   Distance from 'i': 2
   Total distance: 1.5 (1 average distance for two occurrences)

3. sov (ROOT) - och (CC)
  Distance: 3

4. sov (ROOT) - barnen (SUBJ) - (second clause's subject)
   Distance: 4

5. barnen (SUBJ) - sov (ROOT) - (second clause's main verb, but Barnen's head is 'sov')
   This is actually a repeating structure with the first 'sov', see below:
 

6. trångt (ADVL) - ( it's a copula conjunction but we also can look up under second 'sov')
   Distance: 2

7. på (PREP) -sovn trångt  ->( second clause's sov)
   Distance from second sov or main verb  is 1
   
   på (PREP) - en (DET)
   Distance: 1

   en (DET) - slags (NMLZ)
   slags is the word form of slags -  (but we don't have a N in the sentence which this slags refers to)  
   ->  slags (NMLZ)  actually modifies an 'hylla', with head 'en' =  it combines -> slags/en together thus   is = en slags hylla 
   Since they appear together (slags & en hylla + en) - in sentence then  not distinct  we will have only  - en (DET) hylla  == and finally distance is  2

8. ( och 'eller') actually refer 'hylla' and 'skåp', and it has similar distance 
   en (DET)  hylla ->as said above)  ...eller (CC)-  then ->ell (ell-skåp)
   3  distance 2
   
9. skåp (conj & head)  som ( mark)  3 and an overall the final word and 'som'
   when you have -> som -> man  (SUBj)- (main V , from the embedded), ... then this can become S dep verb( main embedded 'verb') 

10. man (SUBJ)- fällde (ROOT)
   Distance: 1 

11. fällde (ROOT) - ner (ADVL)
   Distance: 1

12. fällde (ROOT) - från (PREP) i Prep & and from) =fr. 
   Distance: 2

    på  - when prep/s actually modify verb and thus their is root('fälle) =distance since 2 ( fälle-from): root verb prep -' 
     -Distance==1 then other prep/s so modifies this now overall then and when distance prep == root == fäll 3 v prep ==d rom(both  from)  -- hence ==then drom dep equals sum of it from when ==its ==1

   fällde isn't and from's root (fälle is but prep/'s child or also 'comp prep eualizes in given " fälle : root verb however. We already stated prep/from then in the prep/from root not 'modify'. it will increase at we average one by on average two equals two. then -> Prep since root modify prep one. for more that prep then prep since does above =above.



13. väggen (PMOD) and it Preps 2nd has : therefore and the: of the following embedded : for with distance or 
 from  Prep/s == we two has  to get the final = of all embededd thus == this how with prep/s == embedded we ' embedded head average == of given 

   Given the complexity of the sentence above- 

Total number of tokens = 24
Distance = 45
Average Dependency Distance = 45/ 24 = 1.875
