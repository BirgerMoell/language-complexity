To analyze the sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we first need to identify the dependencies between the words in the sentence. 

Here is the sentence broken down into individual tokens:

1. Resultatet
2. är
3. ett
4. fristående
5. program
6. som
7. inte
8. kräver
9. någon
10. installation
11. dock
12. krävs
13. att
14. plattformen
15. Microsoft
16. .

Dependency analysis:
- Resultatet is the subject of the sentence, and its head is 'är' (distance 1).
- 'är' is the main predicate of the sentence, and its head is the root (distance assigned as 0, as the root distance doesn't affect the average calculation directly).
- 'ett' is the determiner of 'fristående program' and its head is 'program' (distance 2, because it's connected to 'fristående').
- 'fristående' is an adjective modifying 'program', and its head is 'program' (distance 1).
- 'program' is the object of the sentence and the head of 'ett' and 'fristående', and its head is 'är' (distance 3, since 'ett fristående' appears before it).
- 'som' is a conjunction leading to a relative clause, its head is 'program' (distance 1, since this attachment point can vary).
- 'inte' is the negation of the relative clause, its head is 'kräver' (distance 1).
- 'kräver' is the main predicate of the relative clause, and its head is 'som' (distance 1), with an attachment to the root directly indirectly.
- 'någon' is the indirect object of the relative clause and its head is 'kräver' (distance 2).
- 'installation' is the direct object of the relative clause, and its head is 'kräver' (distance 3).
- 'dock' is an adverb modifying 'krävs' and its head is 'krävs' (distance 1).
- 'krävs' is the main predicate of the second independent clause, and its head is the root (as the other main predicate).
- 'att' is a subordinating conjunction leading to a relative clause and its head is 'krävs' (distance 1).
- 'plattformen' is the subject of the clause 'att ... Microsoft', its head is 'att' (distance 1).
- 'Microsoft' is the object of the clause 'att ... Microsoft' and its head is 'att' (it comes immediately before the punctuation, assigning the third unecessary term place the final token for term resolution 'att' -> Microsoft (distance 1)) 

A different head can be argued for some of these relations, so average distances will vary slightly from user to user interpretation in the assessment case.
The sum of all these dependency distances is:
1 + (0 for 'är') + 2 + 1 + (3 corrected distance for main nominal following adjectival chains) + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1.

Calculating the actual sum of these individual terms for determining dependencies is 17. Then the average dependency distance can be calculated as the sum of the distances divided by the number of tokens minus one (to account for the root token), aka
