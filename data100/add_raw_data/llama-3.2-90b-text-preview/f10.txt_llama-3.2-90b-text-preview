To calculate the average dependency distance, we need to analyze the grammatical structure of the sentence. I'll break it down step by step:

1. 'Jag' is the subject of the sentence and is head of the clause. Its distance to 'hoppas' is 1.
   Token 1: 'Jag' - head: 'hoppas' - distance: 1

2. 'hoppas' is the main verb and head of the sentence. No distance to itself.
   Token 2: 'hoppas' - head: itself - distance: 0 (excluded from the calculation because it's the main verb)

3. 'att' is a subordinating conjunction, head of the subordinating clause and dependent of 'hoppas'. Its distance to 'hoppas' is 1.
   Token 3: 'att' - head: 'hoppas' - distance: 1

4. 'ni' is the subject of the subordinating clause and head of the clause. Its distance to 'som' is 1.
   Token 4: 'ni' - head: 'som' - distance: 1

5. 'som' is a conjunctive pronoun and head of a reflexive clause. Its distance to 'läser' is 2.
   Token 5: 'som' - head: 'läser' - distance: 2

6. 'läser' is the main verb of the subordinating clause and head of the clause. No distance to itself.
   Token 6: 'läser' - head: itself - distance: 0 (excluded from the calculation)

7. 'detta' is an object of the verb 'läser' and head of the noun phrase. Its distance to 'läser' is 2.
   Token 7: 'detta' - head: 'läser' or 'arbete' - We need to decide whether 'detta' is agreeing with 'arbete'. For the purpose of this analysis we will treat 'detta' as an adjectival modifier of 'arbete', head: 'arbete' - distance: 3

8. 'arbete' is a noun head and dependent of 'läser'. Its distance is already included.

9. 'ska' is an auxiliary verb head and head of a further subordinating clause. Its distance to 'hoppas' is 7.
   Token 9: 'ska' - head: 'hoppas' - distance: 7

10. 'uppskatta' is the main verb and head of the clause. No distance to itself.
    Token 10: 'uppskatta' - head: itself - distance: 0 (excluded from the calculation)

11. 'det' is a direct object and dependent of 'uppskatta'. Its distance to 'uppskatta' is 1.
    Token 11: 'det' - head: 'uppskatta' - distance: 1

12. 'och' is a coordinating conjunction. No head. This token can't be left out since  'och' will influence 'uppskatta' as coordinating head.
    Token 12: 'och' - head: 'uppskatta' - or head: further in the sentence 'få ut'. In coordinating conjunction it is head of the second coordinated clause - further analysis will see that Token 16 'kunskap' is dependent on the auxiliary 'fått' as part Token 15 so both the left and the right 'och' branches have the same depth so the token och will be tied to what has the shortest depth so this  head we decide to tie 'och' to is Token 16 'kunskap'  at distance: 5

13. 'få' is an auxiliary verb and head of a clause. No distance to itself.
    Token 13: 'få' - head: itself - distance: 0 (excluded from the calculation)

14. 'ut' is a prepositional modifier and head of the prepositional phrase, dependent of 'få'. Its distance to 'få' is 1.
    Token 14: 'ut' - head: 'få' - distance: 1

15. 'lika' is an adverb dependent of 'mycket', is dependent of 'kunskap'. Its dependency relation first traverses from under mucho then under 'kunskap'. 'lika' takes 2 traversals (distance) traversals to  reach 'kunskap' after that add 1. Note Token 'lika' and Token 'lik' are tied to the same distance as it shares the main 'kunskap' head and Token 'li' is 3 Token's ahead of Token 'k
