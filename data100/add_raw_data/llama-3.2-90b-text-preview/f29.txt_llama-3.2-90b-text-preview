To calculate the average dependency distance, we first need to identify the tokens, heads, and dependencies in the sentence. Let's analyze the given sentence:

1. 1985 (i USA) lanserades NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) 1982 hade spelindustrin formligen kollapsat (brukar kallas The Great Video Game Crash Of 1983).

Tokenized sentence:
1. 1985
2. (
3. i
4. USA
5. )
6. lanserades
7. NES
8. (
9. Nintendo
10. Entertainment
11. System
12. )
13. 1982
14. hade
15. spelindustrin
16. formligen
17. kollapsat
18. (
19. brukar
20. kallas
21. The
22. Great
23. Video
24. Game
25. Crash
26. Of
27. 1983
28. )
29. .

Identified dependencies and their distances:

- 1985 -> lanserades (distance: 5)
- i -> i has no direct head in the given sentence, so it's ignored.
- USA -> i has no direct head in the given sentence, so it's ignored.
- lanserades -> root
- NES -> lanserades (distance: 1)
- Nintendo -> NES has no direct head in the given sentence, so NES is the head in this case.
- Entertainment -> Nintendo 
- System -> Entertainment 
- 1982 -> hade (distance: 1), also can be the head, since it can be the 'time' for 'hade'.
- hade -> root
- spelindustrin -> hade (distance: 1)
- formligen -> kollapsat is more likely to be the head, but let's consider hade as the head, as an analysis may vary depending on the interpretation.
- kollapsat -> hade (distance: 3)
- (brukar kallas ...) is a separate clause, parenthesis is not being considered in this case.
- brukar -> kallas (distance: 1)
- kallas -> root
- The -> Great (distance: 1)
- Great -> Video 
- Video -> Game 
- Game -> Crash 
- Crash 
- Of -> for the overall context is considered as a part of this specific sequence and thus is counted as: the Crash happened in the year Of 1983 (distance: 1)
- 1983 -> kallas is likely the head as an analysis can also be interpreted with Crash. 

Let's ignore 'i' and 'USA' since they don't have clear dependencies, 'parenthesized clause for explanation' from NES, use alternative interpretation from (spelindustrin-) formligen, use NES for Nintendo, Entertainment and System when adding those separate tokens so we keep interpretation coherent as possible without over estimating original data for required analysis.

The calculated dependencies are:
- 1985 -> lanserades (distance: 5)
- NES -> lanserades (distance: 1)
- Nintendo (as the whole compound 'Nintendo Entertainment System) is tied -> to NES, then NES to 'lanserades' (not calculated since this won't be separate).
- 1982 -> hade (distance: 1), we'll choose this analysis over hades separate distance for root though other choices remain technically more accurate both interpretations hold different positions overall data usage here however) 
- spelindustrin -> hade (distance: 1)
- formligen -> hade (distance: 2)
- kollapsat -> hade (distance: 3)
- brukar -> kallas (distance: 1)
- The -> Great (distance: 1)
- Great -> Video (distance: 1)
- Video -> Game (distance: 1)
- Game -> Crash (distance: 1)
- Of -> 1983 (for the sake of use analysis have had to for now merge 'Of' location dependency on Crash; however other more exact parsing tools exists) (distance: 1)
- 1983 -> (Crash most intuitive as 'kallas'). distance as root kallas already being used under 'the entire dependency for gamecrisis by now) by current estimates, ignoring their uncounted values.

Sum of the dependencies' distances (calculated ones thus no entire of sentence analysis have this unmodified requirement usage of even then data, it results in):
5 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 18

Total number of the calculated dependencies:
10

Now, let's calculate the average dependency distance:
Average dependency distance = Total distance / Total number of dependencies
Average dependency distance = 18 / 10
Average dependency distance = 1.8
