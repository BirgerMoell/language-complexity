To analyze the sentence, we need to break it down into tokens and identify the dependencies between the tokens.

Here is the sentence broken down into tokens:

1. Många
2. afrikanska
3. regeringar
4. vill
5. helt
6. enkelt
7. inte
8. erkänna
9. att
10. HIV/AIDS
11. är
12. ett
13. stort
14. problem
15. trots
16. att
17. miljoner
18. dör
19. i
20. landet

Next, we need to identify the dependencies between the tokens. Here is the sentence with the dependencies:

- 'Många' (modifier of 'afrikanska')
- 'afrikanska' (modifier of 'regeringar')
- 'regeringar' (subject of 'vill')
- 'vill' (root)
- 'helt' (modifier of 'enkelt')
- 'enkelt' (modifier of 'inte')
- 'inte' (negation of 'erkänna')
- 'erkänna' (object of 'vill')
- 'att' (subordinating conjunction)
- 'HIV/AIDS' (subject of 'är')
- 'är' (predicate of 'HIV/AIDS')
- 'ett' (modifier of 'stort')
- 'stort' (modifier of 'problem')
- 'problem' (object of 'är')
- 'trots' (subordinating conjunction)
- 'att' (subordinating conjunction)
- 'miljoner' (subject of 'dör')
- 'dör' (predicate of 'miljoner')
- 'i' (preposition)
- 'landet' (object of 'i')

Now, let's calculate the average dependency distance:

- 'Många' to its head 'afrikanska': 1
- 'afrikanska' to its head 'regeringar': 1
- 'regeringar' to its head 'vill': 1
- 'helt' to its head 'enkelt': 1
- 'enkelt' to its head 'inte': 1
- 'inte' to its head 'erkänna': 1
- 'erkänna' to its head 'vill': 3
- 'att' to its head 'HIV/AIDS': 1
- 'HIV/AIDS' to its head 'är': 1
- 'är' to 'erkänna' is not a dependency between two tokens in the main sentence as 'är' is part of the subordinate clause; let's not count this as a dependency for the sake of this problem.
- 'ett' to its head 'stort': 1
- 'stort' to its head 'problem': 1
- 'problem' to 'HIV/AIDS': 2
- 'trots' to its head 'miljoner' is not a direct dependency; 'trots' is a subordinating conjunction; let's treat 'trots' as not linked to 'miljoner' for this calculation. 
- 'att' to its head 'miljoner': 1
- 'miljoner' to its head 'dör': 1
- 'dör' to 'erkänna' is not a dependency between two tokens in the main sentence as 'dör' is part of the subordinate clause; let's not count this as a dependency for the sake of this problem.
- 'i' to its head 'landet': 1 (actually, 'i' is the head of 'landet')
- 'landet' to its head 'i': 1

And for the punctuation mark:
- '.'  to 'dör': 3

The sum of the dependency distances is 24. However, considering each of the commas, we should realize we missed counting one in our initial breakdown. Adding one more for the comma:
- ',' to its head is a problem since the comma can be between 'problem' and 'trots'; also since the order of the words could influence the final breakdown and analysis in Swedish. Assuming a correct dependency, for now, let's tie its head to the last used word in the sentence list, which 'dör' with distance of 5.

Summing 24, 5, and 3 yields 32.

Finally, we have 20 tokens with 20 tokens having dependencies (treating 'trots' and the subordinating conjunction 'att' as headless). Therefore, to get the average dependency distance, we will divide 32 by 20. Thus the average is 32/20 = 1.6
