The given sentence is not in Swedish, it seems to be in English. However, I'll still analyze the sentence with respect to its dependency distance. 

First, we need to identify the heads and the dependents in the sentence. 

1. Since [subordinating conjunction]
2. the [determiner] 
   - head: climate
3. climate [noun]
   - head: is
4. in [preposition]
   - head: climate
5. the [determiner]
   - head: attics
6. attics [noun]
   - head: in
7. is [linking verb]
   - head: dependent
8. dependent [participple, head of a passive]
   - head: was
9. on [preposition]
   - head: dependent
10. the [determiner]
    - head: outdoor
11. outdoor [adjective]
    - head: climate
12. climate [noun]
    - head: dependent
13. , [comma]
   - head: decided
   (However, commas aren't usually connected to heads in the same way, so we should ignore it for the calculation of the average dependency distance)
14. it [pronoun]
    - head: was
15. was [main verb]
    - head: decided
16. decided [verb, head of the sentence]
17. that [subordinating conjunction]
    - head: decided
18. outdoor [adjective]
    - head: climate
19. climate [noun, head of the clause]
    - head: decided
20. data [noun]
    - head: climate
21. would [auxiliary]
    - head: be
22. be [main verb]
    - head: would
23. collected [verb]
    - head: would
24. as [preposition]
    - head: collected
25. well [adverb]
    - head: collected

Now, let's calculate the average dependency distance:

1. Since - decided: 8
2. the - climate: 1
3. climate - is: 3
4. in - climate: 2
5. the - attics: 1
6. attics - in: 1
7. is - dependent: 1
8. dependent - was: 9
9. on - dependent: 1
10. the - outdoor: 1
11. outdoor - climate: 1
12. climate - dependent: 1
13. (Ignoring comma)
14. it - was: 1
15. was - decided: 3
16. decided (head of the sentence)
17. that - decided: 1
18. outdoor - climate: 1
19. climate - decided: 5
20. data - climate: 2
21. would - be does not count since it is being 'attached to',  be - would: 1 
22. be (the other auxiliary will simply restate in this analysis a main verb attachment)
23. collected - would: 1
24. as - collected: 0
   (preposition directly tied to a verb)
25. well - collected: 1

Sum = 8 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 9 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 44

Dependency distance count: 23 tokens with edges
Average dependency distance = total distance/dependency distances count = 44/23 = 1.91
