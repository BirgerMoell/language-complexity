To calculate the average dependency distance, we need to analyze the sentence and identify the head of each word (or token). Let's break down the sentence:

1. Enheter - head is "med" ( modifier of the noun), distance is 1
2. med - head is "kan" (main verb), distance is 4
3. låg - head is "energiförbrukning" (modifier of the noun), distance is 1
4. energiförbrukning - head is "kan" (main verb), distance is 3
5. kan - (main verb), no head
6. strömförsörjas - head is "kan" (main verb), distance is 1
7. via - head is "strömförsörjas" (modifier), distance is 4
8. USB-bussen - head is "strömförsörjas" (object), distance is 3
9. då - head is "ingår" (subordinating conjunction), distance is 2
10. det - head is "ingår" (object), distance is 1
11. ingår - head is "kan" (main verb in the subordinate clause), distance is 5
12. en - head is "ström-jord" (modifier), distance is 1
13. ström-jord - head is "sladd" (modifier), distance is 1
14. sladd - head is "ingår" (object), distance is 3
15. i - head is "sladd" (modifier, or "kontakt" in the next sentence), distance is 5 (as the next head can be either "kontakt" or "sladd")
16. varje - head is "kontakt" (modifier), distance is 1
17. kontakt - head is "på" (modifier), distance is 1
18. på - head is "kontakt" (object, or "5V" preposition object), distance is 2
19. 5V - head is "kontakt" (prepositional phrase), distance is 2
20. och - head is "slipper" (main verb of the subordinate clause), distance is 6
21. på - head is "sätt" (preposition object), distance is 1
22. sätt - head is "slipper" (object, or "man" object as possible alternative), distance is 5 (but most suitable head is "slipper")
23. slipper - head is "kan" (the next head can also be the omitted predicate "strömförsörjas" before "kan" or both), distance is 19
24. man - head is "slipper" (object), distance is 1
25. i - head is "man" (modifier), distance is 4
26. många - head is "fall" (modifier), distance is 1
27. fall - head is "man" (object in the prepositional phrase), distance is 2
28. ha - head is "slipper" (object in the infinitive phrase, alternative), distance is 7
29. lösa - head is "transformatorer/nätdelar" (modifier), distance is 1
30. transformatorer/nätdelar - head is "ha" (object), distance is 3
31. till - head is "transformatorer/nätdelar" (preposition), distance is 4
32. varje - head is "enhet" (modifier), distance is 1
33. enhet - head is "kan" (the implied main verb "strömförsörjas" with "kan"), distance is 13
34. . (punctuation mark) head is none.

Now we calculate the average dependency distance by summing up all the distances and dividing by the number of tokens:

Total distance: 1 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 0 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 6 + 1 + 5 + 19 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 7 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 13 + 0 = 102

Average dependency distance: 102 / 34 ≈ 3.00.

Note that this method provides an estimate, and slight variations in parsing and head identification may alter the final result.
