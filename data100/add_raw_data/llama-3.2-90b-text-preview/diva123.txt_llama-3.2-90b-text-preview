To calculate the average dependency distance for the given sentence, we first need to perform dependency parsing on it. Here's a breakdown of the sentence with tokens and their heads:

1. Rapporten - (subject) 
   Head: inleds (distance = 1)
   Tokens in between: None
   Tokens including both: 2
   Distance from Rapporten to inleds = 1

2. inleds - (main verb)
   Head: None
   Tokens in between: None
   Tokens including both: 0 (since there is no head)
   (inleds is the head, not a dependent, so it's not included in the calculation)

3. med - (adposition to 'en litteraturstudie')
   Head: inleds (distance = 1 - note that this may depend on the actual grammatical relationships, 'med' is likely to modify 'inleds', it is usually an instrumental or means case marker)
   Tokens in between: None
   Tokens including both: 2
   Distance from med to inleds = 1

4. en - (modifier, determiner to 'litteraturstudie')
   Head: litteraturstudie (distance = 1)
   Tokens in between: None
   Tokens including both: 2
   Distance from en to litteraturstudie = 1

5. litteraturstudie - (object)
   Head: inleds (distance = 2)
   Tokens in between: med, en 
   Tokens including both: 3
   Distance from litteraturstudie to inleds = 2

6. där - (subordinating conjunction - this would presumably start a dependent clause)
   Head: litteraturstudie (as 'där' introduces a relative clause)
   Tokens in between: None
   Tokens including both: 2
   Distance from där to litteraturstudie = 1

7. ett antal - 'antal' is the quantifier
   'ett' is modifier/determiner to 'antal'. In both cases they are arguments, object to the following verb
   ett antal olika additiva tillverkningsmetoder, 
   ett (distance = 4), antal (distance = 3)
   Tokens in between: olika, additiva, tillverkningsmetoder 
   Tokens including both (ett, head): 5 (ett, olika, additiva, tillverkningsmetoder and redogörs)
   Tokens including both (antal, head): 4 (antal, olika, additiva, tillverkningsmetoder, and redogörs)
   Distance from antal to redogörs = 3
   Distance from ett to redogörs = 4

8. olika, additiva - both are modifier/attribute to tillverkningsmetoder (distance 1)
   Head: tillverkningsmetoder 
   Tokens in between: None
   Tokens including both: 2
   (Distance of each from 'tillverkningsmetoder' would both be 1)

9. tillverkningsmetoder - 
   Head: redogörs (distance 1)
   Tokens in between: None
   Tokens including both: 2
   (Distance of each from 'redogörs' would both be 1, this is similar to the situation with 'tillverkningsmetoder' i.e. these were arguments)
10.  redogörs - 
   Head: inleds (distance = 4 as head, note conjunction would presumably be at an even greater distance)
   Tokens in between: Ett antal olika, additiva , tillverkningsmetoder
   Tokens including both: 5 (redogörs, antal, olika, additiva, and tillverkningsmetoder)
   Distance from redogörs to inleds = 4

   redogörs 'and/or but/since' conjunction could attach different elements of conjunction in 'and avslutas' 
   there are various conjunction links so actual grammatical dependency might be under-determined here. redogörs isn't very clearly used under conjunction or even conjunction 'och'

11. tillsammans - this is an adverb to redogörs
   Head: redogörs
   Tokens in between: None
   Tokens including both: 2
   Distance from redogörs to tillsammans = 1

12. två - modifier/determiner (distance 1)
   Head: olika traditionella tillverkningsmetoder
   (distance in tillverkningsmetoders Head tillverkningsmetoder = 1)

   (under some 'metoder' has different
