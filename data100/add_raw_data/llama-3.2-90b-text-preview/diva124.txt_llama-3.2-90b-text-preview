To calculate the average dependency distance, we first need to split the sentence into tokens and identify the heads of each token. 

1. Syftet (Syftet is the head of the sentence, no dependency distance)
2. med (head: Syftet, dependency distance: 1)
3. denna (head: studie, dependency distance: 1 ( tokens 3 is head of 'denna studie' and distance is between 3 and 4) )
4. studie (head: Syftet, dependency distance: 1)
5. är (head: Syftet, dependency distance: 4)
6. att (head: är, dependency distance: 1)
7. identifiera (head: att, dependency distance: 1)
8. och (head: identifiera, dependency distance: 1)
9. undersöka (head: identifiera, dependency distance: 2)
10. faktorer (head: att (and are part of dependency for 'identifiera och undersöka'), dependency distance: 4)
11. för (head: faktorer, dependency distance: 1)
12. att (head: se, dependency distance: 6)
13. se (head: identifiera (and are part of dependency), dependency distance: 6)
14. huruvida (head: se, dependency distance: 1)
15. det (head: är, dependency distance: 10)
16. är (head: Syftet, dependency distance: 11)
17. mest (head: fördelaktigt, dependency distance: (tokens 17 is dependent on 18 and is 1) )
18. fördelaktigt (head: att (are a dependency of identifiera and undersöka but also head of adverb att fördelaktigt)), dependency distance: 5 (for undersöka and for identifiera))
19. att (head: fördelaktigt, dependency distance: 1)
20. använda (head: att (and are a part of the verb dependency att undersöka), dependency distance is with the whole VP ( are very high and could also be an indication that some tokens are being utilised with dual meanings) )
21. sig (head: använda, dependency distance: 1)
22. av (head: använda, dependency distance: 2)
23. traditionell (head: tillverkning, dependency distance: 1)
24. tillverkning (head: att (are part of verb and dependency of identifiera(att undersöka)), dependency distance: 1 ( but when combined with undersöka it's much greater))
25. eller (head: traditionell (are being used with a dual meaning head: 'i.e ' traditionell och/eller') ', dependency distance: (could either be - since head can be used for this dependent, can have multiple heads - 1 for 'traditionell' in the list or tillverkning in the event it only has tillverkning as the head) 
26. additiv ( head: traditionell, dependent(head as in tillverking has been already accounted for above), dependency distance 1 
    distance when measuring would only occur in the scenario 'traditionell och eller') (i.e has been used above)
27. tillverkning ( head: traditionell and/or as well as having a verb dependency att undersöka etc., dependency distance varied (an added dependency because verb distance varies similar too above)
28. som (head: produktionsmetod, dependency distance is actually smaller than other verbs, dependency distance for verb identifiera around above 11,  5 for productonsmetod above)
29. produktionsmetod ( head: tillverkning (also has verb form that form part that uses and head also having dependency distance above), distance is usually smaller
    (not smallest but smaller and within other not added however this does have head heads still already counted but at much lower)) 
30. för ( head: produktionsmetod, 
   used with the above head even even given a smaller dependency smaller both dependent lower count use method productonsmetod would) dependency distance is 'small' for dependent method so in this case also for not i.e will therefore lower method (distance (having already counted that will be))
31. slutprodukter ( this having verb dependency similar above also usage less common distances compared. dependency like in below verb for att identifiera undersöka and still is (are there and likely common distances small numbers) 
 head: är (productons head) but often might use heads lower down e.g also it can often used tillverkning i.e has many head but part dependency lowest at verb level see "slut" also often around 5 not given head dependent higher usage actually rather similar head 
identifier also head the tillverkning lower when used
