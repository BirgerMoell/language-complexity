To calculate the average dependency distance, we first need to parse the sentence into its constituents and identify the dependencies between them. 

Here's one possible parse:

1. Exporten (Subject) 
   - Head: ökade ( Verb, distance 1)
2. ökade (Verb) 
   - Head: (main verb, no distance)
3. och (Conjunction) 
   - Head: ökade (distance 1)
4. vid (Preposition) 
   - Head: sekelskiftet 1900 (distance 1)
5. sekelskiftet 1900 (Object) 
   - Head: var (distance 2)
6. var (Verb) 
   - Head: (main verb, no distance)
7. Sverige (Subject) 
   - Head: var (distance 1)
8. den (Determiner) 
   - Head: ledande (distance 1)
9. ledande (Adjective) 
   - Head: exportören (distance 1)
10. exportören (Object) 
    - Head: var (distance 2)
11. i (Preposition) 
    - Head: hela (distance 1) or exportören (distance 2), either is possible, let's say the head is hela världen (distance 2)
12. hela (Determiner) 
    - Head: världen (distance 1)
13. världen (Object) 
    - Head: i (not applicable since i is a preposition), its head is actually 'var' or the whole sentence which can't be measured for this question
14. full stop (Punctuation) 
   - Head: (not applicable since it is the end of the sentence), its head can't be defined for calculation

However, calculating full stop in the equation isn't correct, let's remove it.
Now that we have the dependencies, we can calculate the average dependency distance:

 Distance 1: 8 tokens
 Distance 2: 4 tokens
 Total tokens with a head: 12
 Total distance: 1 * 8 + 2 * 4 = 8 + 8 = 16
 Average dependency distance: 16 / 12 = 1.33
