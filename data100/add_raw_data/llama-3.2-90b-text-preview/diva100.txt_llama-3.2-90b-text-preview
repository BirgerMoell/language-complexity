To calculate the average dependency distance, we first need to analyze the sentence and assign dependencies to each token. 

Here is the analysis:
1. Traditionellt - modifier of 'sett' (distance: 1)
2. sett - modifier of 'har' (distance: 1)
3. så - adverb (no clear dependency; exclude for calculation)
4. har - main verb (no dependency; exclude for calculation)
5. järnvägsindustrin - subject of 'har' (distance: 3)
6. haft - verb (no dependency; exclude for calculation)
7. just - adverb (no clear dependency; exclude for calculation)
8. miljöargumenten - object of 'haft' (distance: 3)
9. som - subordinating conjunction (no clear dependency; exclude for calculation)
10. en - determiner of 'fördel' (distance: 3)
11. stark - modifier of 'fördel' (distance: 1)
12. fördel - noun phrase (distance: 4)
13. när - subordinating conjunction (no clear dependency; exclude for calculation)
14. det - relative pronoun (subject of subordinate clause; exclude for calculation)
15. gäller - main verb of sub. clause (distance: 4)
16. passagerartrafik - object of 'gäller' (distance: 4) 

 Tokens not included in the analysis (as they do not have a clear head or are punctuation marks):
 - punkt (not applicable since no head token given)
 - 'så' and 'just' have been treated as discourse markers with no clear depenedency to another token. However it is also valid to consider them as adverbs of 'sett' and 'miljöargumenten'

 Total sum of actual dependency distances: 1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4 
Total number of calculated distances: 9
Average dependency distance: (1 + 1 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 4) / 9 ≈ 2.11
