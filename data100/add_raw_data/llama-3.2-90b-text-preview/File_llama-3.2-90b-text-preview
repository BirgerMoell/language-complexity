To analyze the given sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we first need to know the part-of-speech (POS) of each word and how they relate to each other in a dependency parse. In this case, 'Longest Sentence' appears to be a phrase in English rather than Swedish.

Assuming a possible dependency parse for this phrase in a Swedish context: 

- 'LÃ¤ngsta' is a direct translation of 'Longest', used for adjective-determining purposes.
- 'Mening' is a direct translation of 'Sentence'

There are, however, two possible parses, when considering 'Longest' together with 'Sentence', in a context of it being 'the longest sentence': 

1. Without additional context and knowledge of actual sentence structure: 
- Longest (postmodifier, modifier of sentence) with governing word: Sentence 
     (dependency distance = 1)
- Sentence 
     (dependency distance = 0)

 Average Dependency Distance (ADD) for the above parse would be: 
 (0 + 1) / 2 = 0.5 

However, if the words in the phrase 'Longest Sentence' are analyzed and this is the full sentence itself - or last in a list of items with that name: 

2. Considering the adjectival phrase is together with 'Longest' describing 'Sentence'.
- 'Longest' with dependent word 'Sentence'
     (dependency distance = 1)
 The word 'Sentence' is a dependent of nothing as it is not properly part of the provided text as an example sentence can be seen.

However, one can correctly suppose using sentence length as first part item of the whole: "the longest sentence." includes itself with comma:
 - the (with governing word 'the longest sentence')
     (governing distance to 'sentence' = 3)
- longest (governing word, 'sentence')
     (dependency distance=1)
- sentence.
     (mark, period as dependent in given text (dependency = 0), considering only punctuation should be ignored for true dependency distance though when using true word as end term counting proper dependency calculations so 0= dependency distance, or ignored)

The Average Dependency Distance (ADD) for that given with sentence term ignored or not at end:
 
 (3 + 1)/ 2 = 2 or (3+1+0)/3= 4/3 or 1.33
