To analyze the sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, I'll break down the sentence into its constituent parts, identify the heads of each word or phrase, and then calculate the distance between each word or phrase and its head.

Here's the breakdown:

1. De - subject, head is "sitter" (distance 1)
2. sitter - head is none, is the main verb
3. fast - adverb, head is "sitter" (distance 2)
4. där - adverb, head is "sitter" (distance 3)
5. för - preposition, head is "att" (distance 1)
6. att - subordinating conjunction, head is "kunna" (distance 2)
7. snabbare - adverb, head is "kunna" (distance 3)
8. kunna - auxiliary verb, head is "hantera" (distance 1)
9. hantera - main verb, head is none
10. informationen - direct object, head is "hantera" (distance 1)
11. som - subordinating conjunction, head is "kommer" (distance 2)
12. kommer - verb, head is none
13. från - preposition, head is "datorns olika delar" (distance 3)
14. datorns - possessive pronoun, head is "olika delar" (distance 2)
15. olika - adjective, head is "delar" (distance 1)
16. delar - noun, head is none
17. , - punctuation ( comma ), head is none ( doesn't count towards distance )
18. kort - direct object, head is "hantera" (distance 7)
19. och - conjunction, head is "annan" (distance 1)
20. annan - adjective, head is "utrustning" (distance 2)
21. utrustning - noun, head is none

To calculate the average dependency distance, I'll sum up the distances:

1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 2 = 31

And then divide by the number of tokens (excluding punctuation):

There are 20 tokens without punctuation marks and the punctuation mark has a special treatment, hence the total is 20.

Average dependency distance = 31 / 20 = 1.55

So the average dependency distance for this sentence is approximately 1.55.
