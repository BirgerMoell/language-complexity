To analyze the sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we need to first identify the dependencies between the words in the sentence. We will use the CoNLL-U format to label the dependencies.

Since you provided a sentence in English and not Swedish, I'll proceed with the analysis. Here is the sentence with its dependency analysis:

1. The - (DET) - head: number
2. number - (N) - head: should
3. of - (ADP) - head: experts
4. experts - (N) - head: responsible
5. responsible - (ADJ) - head: should
6. for - (ADP) - head: parts
7. different - (ADJ) - head: parts
8. parts - (N) - head: of (Note: it is also dependent on 'for', and indirectly on 'experts' through 'for', but we will only consider the direct head)
9. of - (ADP) - head: design
10. the - (DET) - head: design
11. design - (N) - head: should
12. should - (AUX) - head: ROOT
13. be - (VERB) - head: should
14. kept - (VERB) - head: be
15. to - (ADP) - head: minimum
16. a - (DET) - head: minimum
17. minimum - (N) - head: to (However, it is more accurate to say its head is 'kept' but we have to consider it also dependent on 'to', I will consider both relationships below)
18. , - (PUNCT) - head: however
19. however - (ADV) - head: should

Now, calculating the dependency distances:

1. The - number = 1
2. number - should = 3
3. of - experts = 1
4. experts - responsible = 1
5. responsible - should = 3
6. for - parts = 2
7. different - parts = 1
8. parts - of = 2
9. of - design = 2
10. the - design = 1
11. design - should = 3
12. should (ROOT) = 0 (we will exclude it from the calculation)
13. be - should = 1
14. kept - be = 1
15. to - minimum = 2 (direct relationship), kept - minimum = 3 (indirect relationship, note this is more meaningful)
16. a - minimum = 1
17. , - however = 1
18. however - should = 4

Since 'minimum' can have dependency distance of either 2 or 3, considering its relationship as the direct child of 'kept' may give more meaningful results. Let's go with 3.

The total dependency distance = 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1
The total number of tokens (excluding the root token 'should') = 18
Average dependency distance = total dependency distance / total number of tokens = 33/18 â‰ˆ 1.83
