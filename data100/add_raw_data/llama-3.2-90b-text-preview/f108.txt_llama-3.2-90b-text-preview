To analyze the sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we first identify the head and dependencies of each token. The dependencies are represented as a tree-like structure, often referred to as a dependency parse tree. Here's a breakdown of the sentence:

1. Då - 'Då' is the main subordinate conjunction and depends on the main verb 'ändrade'.
2. ändrade - 'ändrade' is the main verb and head of the sentence. It depends on the subordinate conjunction 'Då'.
3. ordet - 'ordet' is the direct object and depends on the verb 'ändrade'.
4. hacker - 'hacker' is a modifier (attribute) of the direct object 'ordet' and depends on it.
5. mening - 'mening' is an indirect object and depends on the verb 'ändrade'.
6. till - 'till' is a preposition and head of the phrase 'till att betyda'.
7. att - 'att' is an infinitive marker and head of the phrase 'att betyda'.
8. betyda - 'betyda' is an infinitive verb and head of the phrase 'betyda ungefær'.
9. ungefär - 'ungefär' is a modifier (adverb) and depends on 'betyda'.
10. En - 'En' is a indefinite article and head of the phrase 'En person'.
11. person - 'person' is a noun and depends on 'En'.
12. som - 'som' is a relative pronoun and head of the phrase 'som arbetar'.
13. arbetar - 'arbetar' is a verb and head of the phrase 'arbetar, sover och lever'.
14. , - A comma punctuation mark, the token within the quotes is the head of this punctuation and the token before the comma is the dependee and the token following the comma the head itself: '[person] arbetar, ..., [somer]'
15. sover - 'lever' and 'somer' is a conjunctional phrase that depends on and is a co-dependent of '[person] arbetar'.
16. och - A conjunction of which heads the compound predicate to the sub-clause of 'person som'.
17. lever - 'lever' depends on the co-dependent preceding token '[arbetar] och [somer]'.
18. med - 'med' is a preposition and head of the phrase 'med datorer'.
19. datorer - 'datorer' is an object and depends on the preposition 'med'.
20. -. A full-stop punctuation mark, usually head to those token before, its immediately before the and this represents the 'ord' depending upon preceding 'punkt'.

To determine the average dependency distance, we will now calculate the distance for each token to its head.

- Distance from 'Då' to 'ändrade': 1
- Distance from 'ordet' to 'ändrade': 1 (ordinarily, however given the syntactical and immediate 'pre-ordet' we assign '2')
- Distance from 'hacker' to 'ordet': 1
- Distance from 'mening' to 'ändrade': 3
- Distance from 'till' to 'mening': 1
- Distance from 'att' to 'till': 1
- Distance from 'betyda' to 'att': 1
- Distance from 'ungefär' to 'betyda': 1
- Distance from 'En' to 'person': 1
- Distance from 'person' to 'som' (sub-'arbetar'): 1 (sub-dept 'som')
- Distance from 'som' to 'arbetar': 1 (dependency representing: person,somer,'...')
- Distance from ',' to 'arbetar': 2
- Distance from 'somer' to 'arbetar': 1 (dependency of co-ordinates/ compound predicate to [arbetar]-sub clause under main.)
- Distance from 'och' to 'somer': 1 (dependency representing the conjunction)
- Distance from 'lever' to 'och': 1
- Distance from 'med' to 'lever': 2
- Distance from 'datorer' to 'med': 1
- Distance from '.' to 'till': N/A (approximated '. ' assigned approximate relative at end position within full relative position)

Sum of distances: 1+2+1+3+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+2+1+1 (assigned the general relative 'end' N/A token). 19

The number of tokens is 20.

Average dependency distance = Sum of distances / Number of tokens 
Average Distance calculated = 18 / 20 
Average distance calculated is thus 18
