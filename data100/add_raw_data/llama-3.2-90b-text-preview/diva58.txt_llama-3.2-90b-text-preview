To analyze the sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we first need to break down the sentence into its constituent parts, and identify the relationships between them.

Here's a tokenized version of the sentence with each word or punctuation as a separate token:

1. Syftet
2. med
3. projektet
4. var
5. att
6. ta
7. fram
8. beräknings-
9. och
10. simuleringsverktyg
11. för
12. plattformar
13. som
14. används
15. av
16. ABB
17. FACTS
18. i
19. deras
20. seriekompenseringsanläggningar
21. .

Now, let's identify the dependencies between these tokens. We'll assume a basic dependency structure where each word is dependent on the word that governs its action or function.

- Syftet (1) is the subject, so its head is 'var' (4)
  - Distance: 3
- med (2) is a preposition modifying 'projektet', but 'projektet' (3) has a higher dependence on 'Syftet' as they form the subject. Therefore 'med' (2) also has its head 'projektet' (3).
  - Distance: 1
- projektet (3) has its head 'Syftet' (1) is mentioned above, however Syftet and projektet can be swapped in this context, as either one can have the other as the head in a dependency structure. For now we'll choose the other way around and say Syftet (1) has its head 'projektet' (3) with a distance of 2 and
  - Distance: 0 ( Projektet on itself would be the head)
- var (4) is the main verb. All other parts in this clause will depend on var.
  - No head or head of the sentence (distance not calculated in the dependencies)
- att (5) is an infinitive marker which depends on 'var' (4)
  - Distance: 1
- ta (6) is an infinite verb which depends on 'att' (5)
  - Distance: 1
- fram (7) is an adverb which depends on 'ta' (6)
  - Distance: 1
- beräknings- (8) is a compound word which merges with 'simuleringsverktyg' (10)
  - No head-distance for calculations (is omitted here but in its actual real structure, head is embedded within itself or it does not have)
- och (9) is a conjunction which connects 'beräkningsverktyg' (Not 8, 8's merged compound 10) to other Nouns 'tools'. Would logically depend on 'verktyg' in one N-structure or ABB FACTS as the parent term on second deeper parse tree.  But would logically be more of N-connection that takes parent relations on 
  - Assuming a 'verktyg' branch and not direct-conjoin's 
  - Depending therefore under logical framework assumed : Its either 1 or is counted as another noun 'simuleringsverktyg', with its head 'beräkningsverktyg'. choosing here logical relation   - logical assumption taken - distance - is - och (9) = 1 
  (still  actually: it lacks having N-relation).
- simuleringsverktyg (10) is a noun and has its head 'ta' (6)
  - Distance: 4
- för (11) is a preposition which has its head 'simuleringsverktyg' (10)
  - Distance: 1
- plattformar (12) is a noun which has its head 'för' (11)
  - Distance: 1
- som (13) is a conjunction (subordinating conjunction, relative pronoun) which has its head 'plattformar' (12)
  - Distance: 1
- används (14) is a verb which has its head 'som' (13).
  - Distance: 1
- av (15) is a preposition which has its head 'används' (14)
  - Distance: 1
- ABB (16) has its head 'av' (15)
  - Distance: 1
- FACTS (17) is a noun and has its head 'ABB' (16).
  - Distance: 1
- i (18) is a preposition which has its head 'FACTS' (17).
  - Distance: 1
- deras (19) is a pronoun which has its head 'i' (18)
  - Distance:
