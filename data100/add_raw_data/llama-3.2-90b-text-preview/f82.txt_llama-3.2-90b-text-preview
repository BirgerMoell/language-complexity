To analyze the given sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we need to identify the head words and their corresponding dependents, as well as their distances.

Here's a breakdown of the sentence:

1. Hon - uttryckte (distance: 1)
2. uttryckte - tydligt (distance: 1)
3. tydligt - uttryckte (distance: 1) (Note: 'tydligt' is a dependent, and its head is 'uttryckte')
4. att - uttryckte (distance: 2) (Note: 'att' is a subordinating conjunction introducing the clause)
5. det - hade (distance: 2)
6. hade - räckt (distance: 2) 
7. räckt - (main verb) 
8. med - räckt (distance: 2) (Note: 'med' is a preposition)
9. en - hälsning (distance: 3) 
10. hälsning - räckt (distance: 4) 
11. (comma after hälsning) - (this is a punctuation mark and does not have a head, so it's excluded from the average dependency distance calculation)
12. ett - SMS (distance: 2) 
13. SMS - (no main verb, has connection to the main verb sentence later) 
14. (comma after SMS)  - (punctuation mark, excluded from calculation)
15. en - fråga (distance: 3)
16. fråga - (connected to the same main verb as 'ett SMS' through coordination)
17. om - gå (distance: 2) 
18. att - gå (distance: 2) 
19. gå - (connected to main verb through coordination) 
20. på - lunch (distance: 3) 
21. lunch - tillsammans (distance: 4) (Note: in coordination)
22. tillsammans - (connected to main verb句 'alla ... från - till') 
23. (dash before allt) - (punctuation mark, excluded from calculation)
24. allt - (main verb in dependent clause sentence second to the main verb) 
25. från - allt (or dependent on the main verb, but we'll consider  'från' and 'till' as dependents) 
26. de - handlingar (distance: 3) 
27. minsta - handlingar (distance: 4) 
28. handlingar - (no direct connection but is object of 'från') 
29. till - (dependent on the same main verb and in relation to the main verb 'räckt') 
30. de - handlingar (another, 'de större' is coordinated, same as 'de minsta' so the 'handlingar' becomes  'alla') 
31. (no more token) - situationen (distance: 7 - no more head in that sentence phrase) 
32. för - situationen (distance can be 4; 1 of 'hennes' + 1 'dotter' + 1 'situationen' and 1 'för') 
33. hennes - dotter (distance: 2) 
34. dotter - (connected to main verb sentence through preposition) 

After listing all the tokens and their dependency distances, we can calculate the average dependency distance. The sentence contains 34 tokens (excluding three punctuation marks). 

Sum of the dependency distances = 1+1+1+2+2+2+2+3+3+4+2+2+3+3+4+2+2+2+3+3+4+4+3+3+4+3+4+4+4+1+1+4+2 = 73
Average dependency distance = 73 / 27 = 2.704 

The dependency distances were not calculated for the following tokens: 
- the comma after 'hälsning'
- the comma after 'SMS'
- the dash before 'allt'

These three were excluded as described, since punctuation marks and dash do not have heads and do not affect average dependency distance calculation here.
