To calculate the average dependency distance, we need to break down the sentence into its constituents and analyze the grammatical dependencies between the words. 

Here's the given sentence broken down into individual words or tokens:

1. Medlemmar
2. :
3. Det
4. fanns
5. 172
6. medlemmar
7. i
8. Jönköping
9. vid
10. årsskiftet
11. och
12. i
13. hela
14. Sverige
15. cirka
16. 2500
17. .

Now, we will identify the heads of each word and calculate the dependency distance. I will make some simplifications, assuming the following dependencies:

- Medlemmar (1) is the subject of a clause with no explicit head, so we will not consider it in our calculations.
- Det (3) is the subject of fanns (4), distance is 1.
- 172 (5) is an attribute of medlemmar (6), distance is 1.
- medlemmar (6) is the object of fanns (4), distance is 3.
- i (7) is a preposition attached to Jönköping (8), distance is 1.
- Jönköping (8) is an attribute of årsskiftet (10), distance is 2 (though the exact phrase Jönköping vid årsskiftet might have some semantic depth).
- vid (9) is a preposition attached to Jönköping (8), distance is 0 (ignoring or merging tokens as a part of analysis would be appropriate as there is not a universal rule for these shorter forms but a distance of '1' can also be considered).
- årsskiftet (10) is an attribute of the main clause with fanns (4) as the head, distance is 6.
- och (11) is a coordinating conjunction, not attached to a head, so its distance will not be calculated.
- i (12) is a preposition, similar to i (7), with the distance 1 to its head 'hela' (1 distance) would have been considered but here its head is 'hela Sverige', more appropriately its head is hela Sverige as a whole phrase so distance would be 2.
- hela (13) is an attribute of Sverige (14), distance is 1.
- Sverige (14) is the object of the clause with 'cirka' as intervening attribute and implied main action is 'hade/har' equivalent word to english verb 'had' (as 'cirka 2500' can be assumed having 'hade/har' as unseen/unsaid parent and this has not to be written) of which the visible part is fanns (4), distance is 9.
- cirka (15) is an attribute of the clause described with the 'hade/har' and the same unseen verb of fanns (4), distance is 8 (seen as follows a verb should come after 'cirka' or at other distance with unseen/unsaid main action which was initially written or can be said having in that seen " Det hade...."), distance would be alternatively put as its direct parent is 2500, 1 if considering visible structures only.
- 2500 (16) has the same relationship with 'hade/har' or main unsaid verb as 'fanns' at distance of 5 since the more general head is fanns in relation with our unseen equivalent verb to english 'had', and put head as cirka 1: distance from cirka 2500 to main action on which these has actual dependency is also provided as we simplify our process by visible equivalent hence we use actual spoken as above with assumption the parent is given in the spoken data.
