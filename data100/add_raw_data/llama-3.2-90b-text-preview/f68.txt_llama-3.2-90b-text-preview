To calculate the average dependency distance, we need to break down the sentence into its constituents and their respective heads. 

Here is the sentence with the words and punctuation marked as tokens:

1. Det
2. som
3. indetifierar
4. rasismen
5. är
6. den
7. främlingsfientliga
8. agendan
9. och
10. motståndet
11. till
12. invandring
13. .

Breaking down the sentence:

* 'Det' (1) is the subject of the sentence and the head of 'som' (2), so the distance from 'som' to 'Det' is 1 (but since 'Det' is a subject it doesn't contribute to the average dependency distance).
* 'indetifierar' (3) is the head of 'rasismen' (4), and the distance from 'rasismen' to 'indetifierar' is 1.
* 'är' (5) is a linking verb, and its head is 'indetifierar' (3) in some analysis or the root of the sentence. We'll consider the head of 'är' as 'indetifierar' (3), and the distance from 'är' to 'indetifierar' is 2.
* 'den' (6) is a determiner, and its head is 'främlingsfientliga' (7) is wrong. The correct head is 'agendan' (8), so the distance from 'den' to 'agendan' is 2.
* 'främlingsfientliga' (7) is an adjective, and its head is 'agendan' (8), and the distance from 'främlingsfientliga' to 'agendan' is 1.
* 'agendan' (8) is a compound subject, so 'och' (9) connects it to another part of the subject 'motståndet'. We'll consider the head of 'och' (9) as 'agendan' (8), so the distance from 'och' (9) to 'agendan' is 1.
* 'motståndet' (10) is another part of the subject compound and shares the same head as 'agendan' (8). 'och' (9) is a conjunction. In this case, we'll consider 'motståndet' has its head outside the sentence fragment we consider for the dependency calculation, or 'motståndet' (10) shares the same head as 'indetifierar' (3), and the distance from 'motståndet' to 'indetifierar' is 7 (or it could have a head of its own). 
* 'till' (11) is a preposition, and its head is 'motståndet' (10), and the distance from 'till' to 'motståndet' is 1.
* 'invandring' (12) is an object of 'motståndet', so the head of 'invandring' is 'motståndet' (10), and the distance from 'invandring' to 'motståndet' is 2.
* '.' (13) is a punctuation mark, but it doesn't have head and it's not a determinant in the dependency calculation.

Average dependency distance calculation:

Since 'som' (2) doesn't contribute to the average dependency distance and 'Det' (1) as a subject doesn't contribute to it and 'motståndet' (10) will have its head either outside or within 'indetifierar', there are two cases.

Case 1: When 'motståndet' (10) shares head with 'agendan' (8). Total dependency distance is: (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 1) = 12, and the total number of dependencies is 9, then the average dependency distance is 12 / 9 = 1.33.

Case 2: When 'motståndet' (10) shares head with 'indetifierar' (3). Total dependency distance is: (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 7) = 18, and the total number of dependencies is 9, then the average dependency distance is 18 / 9 = 2.
