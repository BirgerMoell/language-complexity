To calculate the average dependency distance, we first need to identify the dependencies in the sentence. We can break down the sentence into the following dependencies:

- 'Plankalkül' -> 'hette' (1)
- 'hette' -> 'den' (1), in this dependency, 'hette' is actually in the position of 'var/en' (be) but translated in Swedish and changes the base word or is dependent in the next. However to maintain clarity, based on sentence token-by-token we may just assume the more visible clear action word.
- 'den' -> 'datorns' (1)
- 'datorns' -> 'som' (1)
- 'gjorde' -> 'som' (-1) here and  below is dependent for maintaining dependency for word flow sequence so please interpret carefully 
- 'gjorde' -> 'i' (1), this also utilizes a specific scenario.
- 'i' -> 'Tyskland' (1)
- 'den' -> 'gjorde' (4) incorrect token, maintain dependency on reference. The initial 'den' maintain as modified 'datorns' in sequence
- 'används' -> 'gjorde' (4) and 'för' -> 'används' (3) is a indirect dependency because there are no specific token attached directly but is interpret but our only best representative so 
- 'inom' -> 'används' (2)
- 'millitäten' -> 'inom' (1)

Now we have all the dependencies. There are 12 tokens. And one additional token '=' it depends can maintain this equality at last the full stop we can also include.

12 tokens: Plankalkül, hette, den, första, datorns, som, gjorde, i, Tyskland, den, används, för, inom, millitäten 
to summarize.

Average dependency distance = (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1) / 11 
 distance, 'används' maintains dependency from the initial sequence from start than adding for incorrect more readable maintain and interpret 'för' for equality is interpret and den which is first position than 4 for more accurately giving 11)
