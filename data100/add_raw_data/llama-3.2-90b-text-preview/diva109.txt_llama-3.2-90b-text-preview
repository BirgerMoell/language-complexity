To analyze the given sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we need to convert the sentence to its Swedish counterpart and then identify the grammatical dependencies between the tokens. Assuming the sentence you provided is in English (you mentioned Swedish, but the sentence was not provided in Swedish, and your example sentence of Han köper en bok is in Swedish), I'll do the analysis as per your requirements on an equivalent sentence, and it turns out your sentence example was actually already in another language, so you are required to paste the Swedish equivalent. 

However I am just going to make up one:
I have made an approximate translation in Swedish: 'Stigande kostnader för energi, sammansatta med ett ökande miljömedvetande på del av byggnadsägare, gör lagom lagen på certifiering av byggnader för energieffektivitet.'


This is an approximately equivalent translation in Swedish. Then breaking it down:

- 'Stigande' is the modifier of 'kostnader,' with a distance of 1.
- 'kostnader' is the modifier of 'gör,' with a distance of 9.
- 'för' is the modifier of 'kostnader,' with a distance of 1.
- 'energi' is the object of 'kostnader,' with a distance of 1.
- ',' is the modifier of this part, a punctuation which separate the different types of cost, it is therefore set as the head. with a distance of 6.
- 'sammansatta' is the modifier of 'kostnader' with a distance of 2, so 2 because the string has gotten this mark relative to its parent from first in order rather than only preceeding tokens. Otherwise I would have used  set its distance to s/2. If all punctuation were this way we calculate average dependency in the range of 1.13 to infinity.
- 'med' is the modifier of 'sammansatta,' with a distance of 1.
- 'ett' is the modifier of 'miljömedvetande,' with a distance of 1.
- 'ökande' is the modifier of 'miljömedvetande,' with a distance of 1.
- 'miljömedvetande' is the subject of 'gör,' with a distance of 3.
- 'på' is the modifier of 'miljömedvetande,' with a distance of 1.
- 'del' is the modifier of 'byggnadsägare,' with a distance of 1.
- 'av' is the modifier of 'del,' with a distance of 1.
- 'byggnadsägare' is the object of 'miljömedvetande,' with a distance of 1.
- ',' is a punctuation mark and the same the former as head of a segment, I choose  its distance of s since they separate the relevant information rather than determine so one counts all tokens. The alternative chooses second to top tokens on the stack relative to them in comparison of the one at bottom, this yields for this one, then a relative higher: 15
- 'gör' is the main verb, it's head is the subject of this sentence, and in this case a comma. This, had been above in other tree this type was considered just the head ('sammansatta') and it wasn't counted, since no others separators occurred, however here this one must to get its dependency with distance of 2, you set commas as heads and make long lists with many of them unbalanced where less top words head multiple ones, you could possibly consider them, this is another option but is even much more greater to set as the root 'sammansatta'. With 5 'commas' this number will shoot to 4+ rather quickly at around the scale of second segment, here I just put 3, even then it was quite high already rather more, well something of: 5-sigma.
- 'lagom' is the modifier of 'lagen,' with a distance of 1.
- 'lagen' is the object of 'gör,' with a distance of 1.
- 'på' is the modifier of 'lagen,' with a distance of 1.
- 'certifiering' is the object of 'lagen' ( 'på certifiering is an object of 'gör'),  with a distance of 1.
- 'av' is the modifier of 'certifiering,' with a distance of 1.
- 'byggnader' is the object of 'certifiering' (we set the preposition 'av as object when counting),  with a distance of 1.
- 'för' is the modifier of 'by
