To calculate the average dependency distance in the given Swedish sentence, we need to break down the sentence into tokens and identify the head-word dependencies.

 Tokens:
1. Speciﬁkt
2. skulle
3. de
4. krav
5. identiﬁeras
6. som
7. var
8. n¨odv¨andiga
9. f¨or
10. att
11. garantera
12. att
13. applikationer
14. som
15. k¨ors
16. p˚a
17. mellan-varan
18. har
19. st¨od
20. f¨or
21. h˚arda
22. realtidskrav

 Dependency analysis:
1. Speciﬁkt - Head: skulle (Distance: 1)
2. skulle - Head: identiﬁeras (Distance: 2)
3. de - Head: krav (Distance: 1)
4. krav - Head: identiﬁeras (Distance: 1)
5. identiﬁeras - Head: skulle (Distance already calculated for the purpose of dep. distance – we do not count that)
6. som - Head: k¨ors (Distance: 7 because it is 8 words and a comma away, 8-1 for counting from 0 (som's pos), but for som p˚a not being counted)
7. var - Head: n¨odv¨andiga (Distance: 1)
8. n¨odv¨andiga - Head: identiﬁeras (Distance: 4)
9. f¨or - Head: k¨ors (Distance: 6)
10. att - Head: garantera (not shown here - instead refers to : next att) (Distance for analysis is therefore 2 not 1)
11. att - Head (Garantera)  (Here – head already referred to, dist.(shoulder dist): zero/no use given garantera has  to start further along)
12. garantera - Head: att  ( Distance for use = 2 to get to the lower att, headword for dependency purposes, this token is dependency word, not dep. distance counter)
13. att - 'Head word has been calculated' Use 2nd (first lower) for dep-word ( Distance to 2 first lower att Garantera  0 distance refer,word=  with its having being an end head)
14. applikationer - Head: k¨ors (Distance: 1)
15. som - Head: k¨ors (Distance: 1/ because, counted when "applik" was evaluated counted as "mell-(som'swordp.9an refer head refer.")
16. k¨ors - Head: har (Distance: 2)
17. p˚a - Head: k¨ors (correct, with k¨ors also ‘being the head’.but it might be possible in referance: or that it could take a comper:head higher as k¨’s
18. mellan-varan - Head: k¨ors  ,  already K¨’s 
19. har - Head: garantera  (its full dep – distance therefore = 6,
20. st¨od - Head: har (Distance: 1)
21. f¨or - Head: st¨od  (Distance: 1)
22. h˚arda - Head: realtidskrav ,  (Distance: 1)
23. realtidskrav  “do not need it”

 Dependency distances in total: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 7 + 4 + 6 + 2 + 2 + 0 + 0 + 0 +1 + 0 (both lower "som’s,  already evaluated k¨or evaluation), 2 + 1 + 0 + 6 + 1 + 1+ 1 
= 37
