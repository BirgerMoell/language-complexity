To calculate the average dependency distance of the Swedish sentence, we need to break it down into tokens, identify the heads, and then calculate the distance between each token and its head.

Here are the tokens in the sentence:

1. Några
2. virusmakare
3. svarade
4. själva
5. :-
6. Jag
7. gör
8. det
9. för
10. utmaningen
11. att
12. hitta
13. det
14. optimala
15. uttrycket
16. för
17. min
18. talang
19. svarade
20. en
21. .

Now, let's identify the heads for each token. Heads represent the word that a dependent word is connected to grammatically.

- Några (1) -> virusmakare (2) - 'Några' is a determiner modifying the noun 'virusmakare'.
- virusmakare (2) is the subject head of the whole sentence and, in the first clause, also the head of 'svarade' (3).
- svarade (3) is the head of 'själva' (4).
- själva (4) is connected to 'svarade' (3) as an adverb, a dependent of a verb.
- Jag (6) is the subject of the subordinate clause 'Jag gör det'.
- 'gör det' is a clause whose dependent is 'för utmaningen'.
- gör (7) is the head of 'det' (8), utmaningen's dependent, linked by a subordinating preposition 'för' (9).
- för (9) is subordinating 'utmaningen' (10) and not the head of it since the preposition indicates the connection between gör det and the object utmaningen, head 'hitta'.
- hitta (12) is the head of the whole subordinate clause sentence 'hitta det optimala uttrycket för min talang', making att (11) not act as a head.
- det (13) is dependent on hitta's object head 'uttrycket' (15).
- optimala (14) is an adjective attached to 'uttrycket' head (15).
- för (16) connects the option head for hitta's action but in the explanation does not support being an object here and is a preposition, similar to 'för' (9), which is connected to and not acting as a head in the prior "since....making".
- min (17) is an adjective, or rather, possessive genitive of noun functioning as an adjective joined to noun 'talang'.
- talang (18) connects 'svarade' and establishes the relationship with the one answering, making 'svarade' its head in context, though usually a quote not a full independent but embedded within dependent clause or as aside interjections having svarade for head as with rest.

- svarade (19) -> 'en' for 'en' is its head and a subject as individual, assuming 'svarade'.
- ' . '  This can be thought of with main head, previous "svarade"- main quotation within sentence when svarade before which included heads subject so better as svarade when connected for : symbol.

Now let's calculate the distances:

- 2 -> 'virusmakare's word index from head is |2-2|=0 in context 
- 2 also: 3-> 2, so distance there is 1
- 4-> 3 for a distance of 1
- 6-> 'svarade', for dist 3
- 7-> 6 for head, but as verb as relative dependency considered under quotes so use (head index minus (2 if applying current as individual) 'head's word index)
- 8-> 7, distance 1
- 10-> 12 for 2
- 9 is 1 from the 10 it connects  'hitta'.
- 11 (connecting the verb 'hitta' in infinitive)-dist from hitta is 1 
- 13  similar: optimal for ->distance from opt uttrycket index as found above, hitta object using: uttrycket index, word index minus by an index equal  optimal distance + two steps hence total:dist(15-index)+ two, in that second head location after being removed relative hitta and another used- optimal index equals (the connection utrytket has via utrytchet)-5 for index
- 12 from fourteen so index minus from twelve: optimala is index fifteen minus fourteen index of main word for current opt, meaning so adding we get index fifteen for index plus one for addition from twelves, counting hitta's removed after dist added
- With its value 7 distance
