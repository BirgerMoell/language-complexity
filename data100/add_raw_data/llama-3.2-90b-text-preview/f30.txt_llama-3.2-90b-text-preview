To analyze the sentence, we first break it down into its individual tokens:

1. Lully
2. utvecklade
3. recitativ
4. genom
5. att
6. modellera
7. musiken
8. på
9. den
10. franska
11. språkmelodin
12. med
13. noggrann
14. rytm
15. och
16. intonation

Then we identify the head words of each token:

- Lully's head is 'utvecklade' (distance = 1)
- utvecklade has no head (it's the main head)
- recitativ's head is 'utvecklade' (distance = 2)
- genom's head is 'utvecklade' (distance = 4)
- att's head is 'modellera' (distance = 2), but with an indirect relation to 'utvecklade'
- Since 'modellera' is not directly attached to 'utvecklade', we have 'att' (distance = 1) and 'modellera' (distance = 2), making the distance of 'att' to 'utvecklade' 3. Therefore, the distance of 'att' is 3.
- modellera's head is 'utvecklade' (distance = 3), plus 1 for 'att', making a total of 4 to 'utvecklade' but for simplicity the distance of 'modellera' to 'utvecklade' is 5.
- musiken's head is 'modellera' (distance = 1)
- på's head is 'modellera' (distance = 2)
- den's head is 'språkmelodin' (distance = 4), making the distance of 'den' to 'modellera' 5
- franska's head is 'språkmelodin' (distance = 3), making the distance of 'franska' to 'modellera' 4
- språkmelodin's head is 'modellera' (distance = 4)
- med's head is 'modellera' (distance = 6)
- noggrann's head is 'rytm' (distance = 1), and 'rytm's head is 'modellera' (distance = 5)
- rytm's head is 'modellera' (distance = 5)
- och's head is 'modellera' (distance = 6) 
  but also connects with 'intonation' which connects to 'modellera', making a distance of 6
- intonation's head is 'modellera' (distance = 7)

Now, add all the distances:
1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 4 + 6 + 1 + 5 + 6 + 6 + 7 = 74 (17 tokens - one utvecklade has no head, exclude it).
There are 16 distances with a total of 74. Therefore, the average dependency distance is 74 / 16 ≈ 4.63.
