To analyze the sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we need to define the dependencies between the tokens first. We will consider the following tokens:

1. An
2. extensive
3. literature
4. study
5. has
6. been
7. made
8. to
9. evaluate
10. all
11. techniques
12. on
13. the
14. market
15. and
16. characterize
17. what
18. separates
19. the
20. different
21. processes
22. .

Here's a possible dependency analysis of the sentence:

- An (1) modifies 'literature study' (head: 'study', 4), so the distance is 3.
- extensive (2) modifies 'literature study' (head: 'study', 4), so the distance is 2.
- literature (3) modifies 'study' (head: 'study', 4), so the distance is 1.
- study (4) has been modified by three heads above but it has 'has been made' as its head, with 'has' as the auxiliary head. So 'study' (4) modifies 'has' is wrong. Instead 'study' (4) is the head of the nominal phrase, but here its dependency is provided by 'has', and 'has' is not its head, rather 'made' (7) belongs here as well. The nominal and its modification verb phrases will modify processes although they belong to an overall sentence. Thus overall its dependency here is to characterize and its distance is 17.
- has (5) belongs to the verbal dependency of the 'study' nominal, where 'made' (7) is its head, so the distance is 2.
- been (6) depends on 'made' (7), so the distance is 1.
- made (7) has multiple dependents and also modifies 'study' so to characterize but its own head in the overall sentence would be 'characterize' and has the distance of the whole which is 10.
- to (8) is an infinitival marker modifying the subsequent verb, 'evaluate' (9), so the distance is 1.
- evaluate (9) modifies 'made' (7), so its modified word and so as the whole also requires using 'characterize' 8,  so distance is 8.
- all (10) depends on the head 'techniques', so the distance is 1.
- techniques (11) has 'market' as the head based upon its adpositions, the distance of 'on' and 'market' are as head words but the 'technical' belongs to 'made -and -evaluate, so here is an overlapping dependency. But simply dependent is in the on and market is 12-11 =1 and is being supported on 2 token's for making length as long and then an is already seen long dependency.
- on (12) is an adposition modifying 'the techniques' - so here dependency head is given, 11 and  11-12  equals -1 where in previous word to an amount of head words dependency applied is for previous not current at this dependency for calculating =+2 amounting  to dependency on 
- the (13) is an article modifying 'market' (14), so the distance is 1.
- market (14) is the head of 'techniques'. But its modified as 'characterize' requires same - head amounting here dependency upon long dependency. As a result of the requirement here is 9.
- and (15) is used as a conjunction linking 'evaluate' and 'characterize', so the distance is 1 (or its head but here evaluated based character depends for conjunction) i.e., 2 - since also depends 'evaluate'.
- characterize (16) has the same dependency requirements where we computed this is from both head evaluate as characterize are equal here this 'made' character will further undergo. So to "separates" then comes its "different processes", a subclausal sentence in nominational that is.  Is dependency further equals here of for conjunction distance evaluated so after  it use "characterize is 10  but with other also to character the for when compute dependency. Lastly dependency evaluate prior will computes then 8
- what (17) is an interrogative pronoun modifying the 'processes', but has subclausal word  amount at higher subclausal for  computes such dependency use with now given and dependency length result  character results in =4.
- separates (18) is the main verb of the subclausal 'what separates the different processes' but modified for equal compute comes see has equal use modify subclausal, so we treat words use use after higher up to evaluates separation here when becomes - "what" which is itself not see modified the verb further we treat after get  'separates' computes both here takes 'is here
