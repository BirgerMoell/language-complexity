To analyze the Swedish sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, I will break it down as follows:


1. 'Ett' depends on 'delmålen', distance: 3 ( indirect dependency: 'Ett av' "one of" that starts a phrase where ett is dependent to 'delmålen'), 
   Correct representation would be "av delmålen" hence distance is "3)

2. 'av' depends on 'delmålen', distance: 1
3. 'delmålen' depends on 'varit', distance: 3
4. 'med' depends on 'delmålen', distance: 2
5. 'NTRAC' depends on 'delmålen', distance: 4
6. 'har' depends on 'varit', distance: 5
7. 'varit' is head of the main clause, 
8. 'att' is subordinating conjunction for dependency on 'varit', therefore no distance.
9. 'det' depends on 'ska', distance: 2
10. 'lätt' depends on 'ska', distance: 3
11. 'ska' depends on the implicit subordinating construction of  'att' in dependency to 'varit' ( clause modifier, and part of main clause) 
12. 'kunna' depends on 'ska', distance: 1
13. 'anpassas' is depends on 'kunna', distance: 1
14. 'till' is depends on 'anpassas', distance: 1
15. 'olika' is depends on 'fordon', distance: 1
16. 'fordon' is depends on 'anpassas' indirectly on main clause, but distance here counted with next head, distance: 2. 
17. 'NTRAC' depends on 'har', distance: 1
18. 'har' depends on main clause construction and is main clause modifier for second independent construction.
19. 'därför' depends on 'har', so modifies an action of same distance 3 from the action, distance: 3
20. 'implementerats' is the second action depending on 'har', hence depends on 'har', depending on main clause modifier for second clause, distance 4 ( counted as as two clause joined at "har").
21. 'i' depends on 'implementerats', distance: 1
22. 'två' depends on 'testbilar', distance: 1
23. 'testbilar' depends on 'implementerats', distance: 2
24. 'av' depends on 'testbilar', distance: 3 
25. 'skiljda' depends on 'mått', distance: 4 via prep ("av") and 
26. 'mått' depends on 'motorkaraktäristik' (an attribute of a noun phrase), indirect dependency on compound noun - 'fysikaliska mått och motorkaraktäristik' (as attribute) and prep based construction for compound, distance: 4 
27. 'och' depends as coordinating conjunction 'skiljda', distance:  only occurs here just for enumeration ( dependent distance as enumeration), 
28. 'fysikaliska' depends on 'mått', indirectly. but more than prep directly attribute. no count more direct count is by "och" distance :1.
29. 'motorkaraktäristik' as further attribute distance to same, is enumeration or prep is same: ( prep based) attribute for compound noun at same enumeration as "mått" to count depend dist dist for. enumeration "skiljda", distance 5.

Since list no follows "in enumeration, distance start may (or may not) need to to as before enumeration begin e.g., "skilda' is attrib with "motorkarakteris-" for listing
some complexity

Final dependency distances then calculated is as 

total distance so is the no of tokens 
E.g., tokens are "30" "i" and "to" etc the token that will not occur here were deleted so less relevant words or no dep i 
can assign just list 
Then average or dist measure would finally be sum the all the listed divided no "dependency tokens in above list, now "distances" and now tokens, added relevant
like these extra after count is (token occur left or or as a first dep  but (distance one : for tokens also)


Avg = {[(3 +1 +3 2) + 4+5 2] + [11]  + [5 11 + 20 25] + [4 3 4+ 1 1 +4 4+1 25 1 3+ 3+  +5]}/ number of tokens .

total sum
