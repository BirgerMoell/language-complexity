Tokenize the sentence:
1. Är
2. vätskan
3. varm
4. ,
5. späd
6. lite
7. i
8. sänder
9. under
10. omrörning
11. och
12. låt
13. redningen
14. koka
15. upp
16. mellan
17. varje
18. spädning
19. .

Now, identify the head of each token and its dependency relationship:

1. Är - Main verb (Head of the sentence)
   Dependencies: vätskan -> Är; varm -> vätskan
   Distance from 'vätskan' to its head 'Är' is 1
   Distance from 'varm' to its head 'vätskan' is 1

2. Vätskan is the object of Är
   Dependencies: None (not considered as main object here since relation already described)

3. Varm is the predicate of vätskan
   Dependencies: None (not considered as it is also mentioned before)

4. ,
   Dependencies: 
   Comma separation should be connected to their relevant head. Let's consider it joins the condition with the actual activity
   Distance from ',' to 'späd' (verb head for its relevant clause) is 2.  
   Distance includes the presence of dependent elements after comma effectively starting at Är and getting conditioned, setting up a sequence leading to späd.

5. späd
   Dependencies: lite -> späd; i sänder -> späd; under omrörning -> späd; 
   Distance from 'lite' to its head 'späd' is 1
   Distance from 'sänder' to its head 'späd' is 2 
   Distance from 'omrörning' to its head 'späd' is 3

6. Lite
   Dependencies: None

7. i
   Dependencies: sänder -> i

8. sänder
   Dependencies: None
   Distance from 'i' to its head 'sänder' is 1

9. under
   Dependencies: omrörning -> under

10. omrörning
   Dependencies: None
   Distance from 'under' to its head 'omrörning' is 1

11. och
   Coordinating conjunction. Use this head as a conjunction. Should look at the joined entities head entities.

12. låt
   Dependencies: redningen -> låt; koka -> låt; (rest secondary)

13. redningen 
   Dependencies: None (describe connections with this under låt)
   Distance from 'redningen' to its head 'låt' is 1

14. koka
   Dependencies: 
   Co-ordinated verb to the first part with späd and leading for a secondary description.
   Distance from 'koka' to its head 'låt' is 2

15. upp
   Adverb. Relate to koka not låt.
   Distance from 'upp' to its head 'koka' is 1

16. mellan
   Dependencies: varje -> mellan; spädning -> koka through köz relation

17. varje
   Dependencies: None
   Distance from 'varje' to its head 'mellan' is 1

18. spädning
   Dependencies: None and closing dependency needs (lead towards closing phrase)

   Distance from 'spädning' to 'koka' is 2 

Finally to get average calculate for distance
1+1+2+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+2+1+1+1+2+1+1+2 = 22 
Since the total number of dependency used is 22, now by dividing that we have 19 segments participating in dependency making it total dependency 19. Finally 22/19 = 1.157 is the number resultant
