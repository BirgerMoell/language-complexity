To analyze the sentence, we need to identify the dependencies. 

Here's the breakdown of the sentence into tokens:
1. Är
2. det
3. möjligt
4. att
5. genom
6. kombinationer
7. av
8. kända
9. lösningar
10. få
11. en
12. mer
13. långsiktig
14. lösning
15. på
16. fuktproblematiken
17. i
18. uteluftsventilerade
19. krypgrunder

Now, we need to identify the dependencies:
- 'Är' is the main verb.
- 'det' is the subject.
- 'möjligt' is an adjective, but it can be linked to 'är', distance is 1.
- 'att' is a subordinating conjunction.
- 'genom' is a preposition, and is linked to 'att', distance is 1 (att -> genom, subordinating).
- 'kombinationer' is the object of 'genom', distance is 1.
- 'av' is a preposition, and is linked to 'kombinationer', distance is 1.
- 'kända' is an adjective linked to 'lösningar', distance is 1.
- 'lösningar' is the object of 'av', distance is 1.
- 'få' is linked to 'att', distance is 4 (att -> ... -> få).
- 'en' is a determiner linked to 'lösning', distance is 1.
- 'mer' is an adverb linked to 'långsiktig', distance is 1.
- 'långsiktig' is an adjective linked to 'lösning', distance is 1.
- 'lösning' is the object of 'få', distance is 3 (få -> ... -> lösning).
- 'på' is a preposition linked to 'få', distance is 4 (få -> ... -> på).
- 'fuktproblematiken' is the object of 'på', distance is 1.
- 'i' is a preposition linked to 'fuktproblematiken' (in this case though it leans to the next token), distance to the head 'fuktproblematiken' is 0, head 'uteluftsventilerade' distance is 1 (i 'uteluftsventilerade').
- 'uteluftsventilerade' is an adjective, distance is 1 (it leans to the next token).
- 'krypgrunder' is the object of 'i', distance is 1.

The distance is measured from the token to its head (dependency).

Now the average dependency distance can be calculated as the sum of the distances divided by the number of dependencies:
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 (treated as 1) + 1 + 1 = 26.

The number of dependencies is 18, but we also need to calculate two extra dependency distances because certain tokens in this sentence express multiple functions.

Average Dependency Distance (ADD) is therefore 26 / 20 = 1.3.

This is a rough estimate of the sentence's average dependency distance.
