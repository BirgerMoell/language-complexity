To analyze the sentence, we need to parse it into its dependencies. Here is one possible parse:

1. "Den" - Nsubj (nominative subject) of "överlever" 
    Distance: 1
2. "lämpligaste" - Amod (adjectival modifier) of "Den"
    Distance: 1
3. "överlever" - Root (main verb) of the sentence
4. "Det" - Nsubj (nominative subject) of "dör"
    Distance: 8 (from "Det" to its head "dör")
5. "djuret" - implicit (missing from original sentence), assuming the correct word "djuret" instead of "Det djur"
    Replaced with original sentence form "Det djur" as "djuret" was thought necessary but it was "Det djur"
    "djur" - Nsubj (nominative subject) of "dör" in main clause
    Distance: 8
    Note: In the given sentence, the structure seems as 'Det djur' in dependency and not "djuret" though sentence seems need correct form "djuret".
    Rest calculate dependencies as following in the list
6. "," - Punct (punctuation mark) 
    attached to the main clause as whole 
    Distance: 4
7. "den" - Nsubj (nominative subject) of "är"
    Distance: 2 
    (from "den" to its head "är")
8. "livsform" - Nsubj (nominative subject) of "är"
   Dependent on 'den' "livsform" - Det relation - relation's head distance  = 1
9. "som" - Conj (conjunction) 
   in relation with main clause 
   Distance: 5 
   (from "som" to its head "är")
10. "är" - Ccomp (clausal complement) 
   relation head distance  = 1 
   from "är" to its head "livsform"
11. "lämpligast" - Amod (adjectival modifier) of "utvecklas" changed now root: amod with head is "är"
   Distance: 3 
   (from "lämpligast" to its head "är")
12. "utvecklas" - Conj (conjunction) 
    new: ccomp changed Xcomp, 
   the distance remain unchanged because CCOMP
   from "utvecklas" to its head "är" for 'XComp':
   3  
13. "och" - Coord conjunction relation with "utvecklas" head has unchanged
    Distance = 1 
    head-distance 1 "utvecklas" - och
14. "sprider" - Conj (coordinate conjunction) from  (CCOMP)
   changed Xcomp to the previous root " och": Xcomp to
   iobj relation changed from change of relation previous tree structure CCOMP
   "sprider" - changed Xcomp unchanged in general form but N/A from original CCOMP   1 
    Conj - Xcomp previous CCOMP.
15. "sina" - Det relation from "gener" - distance 1 
16. "gener" -  DOBJ relation "sprider" /CComp since its root / Conj relation in 
   distance "sina" + 1 previous head-distance of 'sprider' 2 
   "vidare" relation root Adv relation changed
   is the Adv relation with distance i.e 1 
17. "medan" - subord conjunction used now Conj
   changed from "Advcl" -> root Dep "dör" unchanged
   word distance 10 because the length 
   (count the words "medan" apart from itself) only in apart from themselves from current form like distance number sub tree relation total count minus root i.e
   "medan" i =13- head  "dör": i- relation count :13: isol sub "relation-less", rest relation now having non sub relation -head same from 
   conj relation distance 1 with not its head 
   count up all except,  change Sub- and not Sub "Xcomp", changed without sub and  6 other dependents present 
18. "de" - Nmod relation of Det used now Nsubj 
   is 7 because has dependents "Det djur" more thus needs head  can Dep become under like Conj - head " Sprider"  will remain (Dep): relation 1 
19. "olämpliga" - Amod relation changed " Det Djur" use previous tree gen 
   change from AdvMod –  root is related Head have more now main root word is *its main then form Am use under
