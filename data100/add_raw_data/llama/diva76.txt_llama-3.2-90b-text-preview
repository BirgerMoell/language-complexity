To analyze the sentence, we need to identify the grammatical dependencies between tokens. I will assign the indices based on word position in Swedish (first word, 'Vi', as 0). Here are the word indices:

0. Vi (we)
1. vill (want)
2. tacka (thank)
3. vår (our)
4. handledare (supervisor)
5. Folke (first name)
6. Björk (last name)
7. ,  (comma)
8. Universitetslektor (university lecturer)
9. vid (at)
10. institutionen (institution)
11. för (for)
12. Byggvetenskap (building science)
13. KTH (Royal Institute of Technology)
14. ,  (comma)
15. för (for)
16. löpande (running)
17. handledning (guidance)
18. och (and)
19. hjälp (help)
20. under (during)
21. arbetets (work)
22. gång (on-going)
23. samt (and)
24. vår (our)
25. bihandledare (assistant supervisor)
26. Bert (first name)
27. Norlin (last name)
28. ,  (comma)
29. Byggvetenskap (building science)
30. KTH (Royal Institute of Technology)
31. , (comma)

Let's analyze the dependencies:

1. Vi (index 0) is connected to vill (index 1), distance: 1
2. vill (index 1) is the main verb and connected to tacka (index 2), distance: 1
3. tacka (index 2) is connected to handledare (index 4), distance: 2 (passing over vår)
4. vår (index 3) is connected to handledare (index 4), distance: 1
5. handledare (index 4) is connected to vill (index 1), distance: 3 (already counted in 2)
6. Folke (index 5) and Björk (index 6) are both connected to handledare (index 4), distance: 1 each
7. handledare (index 4) is connected to vill (index 1), not a new dependency
8. Universitetslektor (index 8) is connected to Björk (index 6), distance: 2
9. vid (index 9) is connected to Universitetslektor (index 8), distance: 1
10. institutionen (index 10) is connected to vid (index 9), distance: 1
11. för (index 11) is connected to institutionen (index 10), distance: 1
12. Byggvetenskap (index 12) is connected to för (index 11), distance: 1
13. KTH (index 13) is connected to Byggvetenskap (index 12), distance: 1
14. , (index 7) is a punctuation mark and has the same distance as a word or phrase would have from handledare (index 4) -  if we parse  "handlare , vid institution" so a distance of 3
15. för (index 15) is connected to handledning (index 17), distance: 2
16. löpande (index 16) is connected to handledning (index 17), distance: 1
17. handledning (index 17) is connected to tacka (index 2), distance: 15 (but also can be linked to tacka on sentence parsing strategies on when "och" introduces)
18. och (index 18) is a conjunction and its distance depends on exact parsing methods hence counted in other words. However for purpose of answer lets attach the word 'hjälp' to the word 'tacka' giving distance: 6 ( and hence total 6 steps back).
19. hjälp (index 19) is connected to tacka (index 2),  (hence distance derived above as an exercise consideration)
20. under (index 20) is connected to hjälp (index 19), distance: 1
21. arbetets (index 21) is connected to under (index 20), distance: 1
22. gång (index 22) is connected to under (index 20), distance: 2
23. Our (already seen)
24. Our bihandledare has same structure as our handledare  - folke Björk above so also repeat indexes as in above step numbers 23-25 steps back 

All ignored objects in handling in this question has link dependencies and assumed that analysis runs in reverse chronological order otherwise need take some from end. Given all the ignored or given steps assuming otherwise
