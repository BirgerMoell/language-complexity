To analyze the sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we need to first identify the tokens and their dependencies. We will use a simplified dependency grammar for Swedish. This analysis might not be perfect as dependency parsing is a complex task that often requires additional context and nuances.

Here is the sentence with tokens numbered:

1. Hon
2. hade
3. många
4. poser,
5. jag
6. tyckte
7. inte
8. de
9. var
10. så
11. speciella,
12. hon
13. var
14. flickan
15. alla
16. tjejer
17. konstigt
18. nog
19. ville
20. vara
21. och
22. alla
23. killar
24. ville
25. ta
26. på

Now, we identify the dependencies:

- 1 (Hon) is subject of 2 (hade)
  - Dist: 1
- 3 (många) is modifier of 4 (poser)
  - Dist: 1
- 4 (poser) is object of 2 (hade)
  - Dist: 1
- 5 (jag) is subject of 6 (tyckte)
  - Dist: 1
- 6 (tyckte) is main verb in the clause, no direct head
- 7 (inte) is negation of 6 (tyckte)
  - Dist: 1
- 8 (de) is subject of 9 (var)
  - Dist: 1
- 9 (var) is main verb in the clause, no direct head, head for the auxiliary
  - (this distance calculation could go either to tyckte or var - depending on the context,  we assume var, because the "var" represents presence/state)
- 10 (så) is modifier of 11 (speciella)
  - Dist: 1
- 11 (speciella) is predicate of 9 (var)
  - Dist: 2
- 12 (hon) is subject of 13 (var)
  - Dist: 7 (a result of the long dependency, but many of these should be subordinated, this may be adjusted, to match tree-bank more so here:   'dej' form as subordination is assumed rather than coordination 'both clauses are needed for the full meaning' adjustment:  dist 2 for hon(head var) ealier var is one distance)
- 13 (var) is main verb in the clause, no direct head
- 14 (flickan) is predicate of 13 (var)
  - Dist: 1
- 15 (alla) is modifier of 16 (tjejer)
  - Dist: 1
- 16 (tjejer) is object of 19 (ville)
  - for chain "alla killar" it can actually be modified to "alla" modifying in entirety for sense the chain without having to create an addition auxiliary rather for killar(ville not yet main clause)for the most efficient treebank : chain of full modification going to killar hence this yields: Dist 6 for chainKillar
