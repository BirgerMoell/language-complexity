To analyze the sentence, we need to break it down into tokens and determine the head words and their dependencies. 

Here's the tokenized sentence:
1. Nu
2. i
3. efterhand
4. har
5. jag
6. förstått
7. att
8. de
9. bara
10. var
11. ute
12. efter
13. en
14. identitet
15. i
16. ett
17. samhälle
18. där
19. alla
20. är
21. anonyma
22. .

The dependency relations can be determined as follows:
- 'Nu' (1) is an adverbial adjunct with its head 'har' (4), so its dependency distance is 3.
- 'i' (2) is a preposition with its phrase 'i efterhand' that modifies 'Nu', its head is still 'har', so its dependency distance is 2.
- 'efterhand' (3) is a prepositional object with head 'i', and 'i' is a preposition with head 'har', so its dependency distance is 1.
- 'jag' (5) is a subject with its head 'förstått' (6), so its dependency distance is 1.
- 'förstått' (6) is a complement clause with its head 'har' (4), so its dependency distance is 2 (from 'förstått' to 'har').
- 'att' (7) is a complementizer introducing the complement clause, its head is 'förstått', so its dependency distance is 1.
- 'de' (8) is a subject with its head 'var' (10), so its dependency distance is 2 (from 'de' to 'var').
- 'bara' (9) is an adverb modifying 'var', so its dependency distance is 1.
- 'var' (10) is the main verb in the complement clause, its head is 'förstått' in the main clause, so its dependency distance is 3 (from 'var' to 'förstått').
- 'ute' (11) is an adverb modifying 'var', so its dependency distance is 1.
- 'efter' (12) is a preposition with its phrase 'efter en identitet' that modifies 'var', its head is 'var' (10), so its dependency distance is 2 (from 'efter' to 'var').
- 'en' (13) is a quantifier with its head 'identitet' (14), so its dependency distance is 1.
- 'identitet' (14) is an object with its head 'efter', and 'efter' has a head of 'var', so its dependency distance is 2 (from 'identitet' to 'var').
- 'i' (15) is a preposition with its phrase 'i ett samhälle', it has 'samhälle' (17) as its object, the whole phrase modifies 'var', so its dependency distance is 2 (from 'i' to 'var').
- 'ett' (16) is a quantifier with its head 'samhälle', so its dependency distance is 1.
- 'samhälle' (17) is a prepositional object, the head of this whole phrase is 'var', so its dependency distance is 2 (from 'samhälle' to 'var').
- 'där' (18) is a subordinating conjunction introducing the adverbial clause that modifies 'samhälle', its head is 'samhälle' (further back is 'var'), but we consider its immediate head for dependency calculation which is 'samhälle', so its dependency distance is 1.
- 'alla' (19) is a quantifier modifying 'är', so its dependency distance is 1.
- 'är' (20) is the main verb of the embedded clause in 'där alla är anonyma', and this whole phrase modifies 'samhälle', its head is 'samhälle' (17), so its dependency distance is 2 (from 'är' to 'samhälle').
- 'anonyma' (21) is a predicate, the head of the 'anonyma' is 'är', so its dependency distance is 1.
- '.' (22) is punctuation and functions to mark the end of the sentence, in dependency analysis its head isn't well-defined within the sentence so it is often neglected.

Now we add all the distances up and divide by the number of words we considered:
- Dependency distance sum is 3 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 2 +
