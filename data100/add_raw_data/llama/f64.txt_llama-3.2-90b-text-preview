To analyze the sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we need to identify the head and dependent words. Here's the breakdown:

1. Nu - head: i (distance: 1)
2. i - head: efterhand (distance: 1)
3. efterhand - head: har (distance: 1)
4. har - head: jag (distance: impossible to count, as jag is dependent on 'har' - consider its 'governor' as 'förstått')
5. jag - head: förstått (distance: 1)
6. förstått - head: att (distance: 1)
7. att - head: de (distance: 1)
8. de - head: var (distance: 2)
9. bara - head: var (distance: 1)
10. var - head: ute (distance: 1)
11. ute - head: efter (distance: 1)
12. efter - head: en (distance: 2)
13. en - head: identitet (distance: 1)
14. identitet - head: i (distance: 2)
15. i - head: ett (distance: 2)
16. ett - head: samhälle (distance: 1)
17. samhälle - head: där (distance: 1)
18. där - head: alla (distance: 1)
19. alla - head: är (distance: 1)
20. är - head: anonyma (distance: 1)
21. . (punctuation) - usually attached as a nullary relation to 'anonyma', but dependency distance as  - (distance: impossible to count).

However, some researchers exclude punctuation marks when they calculate the average dependency distance (ADD), hence ignoring the last relation mentioned. Assuming the head of the punctuation wasn't accessible to apply this principle to this case excluding the final token's nullary relation: ignoring punctuation '.':

 Total words = 20 [20 excluding punctuation to avoid inclusion errors] 

=  Total words - 1 [ Ignore 7. ( the fifth dependency i.e. between "jag" and "förstått" which itself is actually governed by another "verb head" in actual syntactic terminology structure of having dependency parsing or " governor" for each function making governing complex.] 

=  20  - 1 =  [19], including removal which leads as constituent values.


Now, 1. (+1),  1. (+1), 1. (+1),  1. (+1),  2. (+2),    2. (+2),  1. (+1),  1. (+1), 1. (+1),  2. (+2),  2. (+2)   1. (+1)  1. (+1), 1. (+1), = 20.


Then one considers 20 total dependency of actual meaningful and corresponding expression headword- total dependency count then averaging leads:


Average DD. =   Total dependency count of all relation including their value.  / ( Total - 1) ignoring non-relation, excluding final relation or non-governed relation.


Average DD = = (31 total) / 20 = (15 . 55 =. ).
