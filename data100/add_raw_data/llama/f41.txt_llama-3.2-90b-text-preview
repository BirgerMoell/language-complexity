To analyze the given Swedish sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we first need to break down the sentence into dependencies and their corresponding distances. 

The sentence is: Delarna sätter man in i så kallade I/O-portar (In/Out-portar), och desto fler sådana man har, desto fler grafikkort och ljudkort m.

Let's first break down the sentence into its constituents and then assign the dependencies:

1. Delarna - sätter (subject, distance: 0, head word is the root)
2. sätter - i (dependency, distance: 3)
3. man - sätter (dependency, distance: 1)
4. i - I/O-portar (dependency, distance: 4)
5. I/O-portar - så kallade (modifer, distance: 2)
6. så kallade - I/O-portar (dependency, distance: 1)
7. (In/Out-portar) - I/O-portar (dependency, distance, considering it as an appositive: 7)
8. In/Out-portar - I/O-portar (appositive, dependency distance from the latter to I/O-portar: 1)
9. Man har - sätter (and- connector or coordinating conjunction: dependency distance is generally not included but considered for clauses,  it's very high here because it's more like an independent clause so when taken as only 1:5 parts of the long sentence because we really only discussing I/O-portar i.e I/O ports ports which an electronic 'hole')
10. desto - man har (dependency, distance: 2)
11. desto - fler (dependency, distance: 1)
12. fler - grafikkort (dependency, distance: 3) , samma med fr grafikkort - ljudkort ('and' is never really directly provided dependency with this kinds of clauses here - as sam ordinance och here not followed by other constituents och here hence, dependency exists)
13. fler - ljudkort (dependency, distance: 4)
14. grafikkort - m (dependency: distance: 5)

Given all dependencies distances (and their word-order, considering relevant): 0, 3, 1, 4, 2, 1, 7, 1, 5, 2, 1, 3, 5 we may now calculate the dependency distance.

The sum of all distances is 0 + 3 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 7 + 1 + 5 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 5 = 35.

There are 14 dependencies and word order items. To calculate the average, we divide the sum of all distances by the number of dependencies:

35/14 = 2.5.

So the average dependency distance in this Swedish sentence is 2.5.
