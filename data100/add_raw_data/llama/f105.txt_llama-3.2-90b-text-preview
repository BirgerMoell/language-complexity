To analyze the sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we need to identify the head of each word and calculate the distance between each word and its head.

Here's the breakdown of the sentence:

1. Så (fort) - distance: 1 (Så is an adverb, and its head is "fort")
2. fort (man) - distance: 1 (fort is an adverb, and its head is "man", but for simplicity, let's assume its head is the verb "ska")
3. man (sätta) - distance: 7 (man is the subject of the main clause, and its head is the verb "sätta", but "man" is not directly connected to "sätta",  since "sätta" is a subordinate clause. However, let's use 7 since there are other subclauses attached to "ska")
4. misstänker (att) - distance: 1 (misstänker is a verb, and its head is the subordinating conjunction "att")
5. att (är) - distance: 2 (att is a subordinating conjunction, and its head is the verb "är")
6. datorn (är) - distance: 1 (datorn is the subject, and its head is the verb "är")
7. är (smittad) - distance: 1 (är is a linking verb, and its head is the adjective "smittad")
8. smittad (av) - distance: 1 (smittad is an adjective, and its head is the preposition "av")
9. av (ett) - distance: 1 (av is a preposition, and its head is the determiner "ett")
10. ett (virus) - distance: 1 (ett is a determiner, and its head is the noun "virus")
11. virus (så) - distance: 5 (we ignore short-distance backward arcs with short-distance forward arcs according to most cases; however, some research may not, and there are multiple acceptable correct analyses depending on which research or parsing information theory we may depend on, but "virus" is in the "att" clause, and its head can be considered as the next main clause which is  "så"), for example. 
12. så (ska) - distance: 1 (så is an adverbial connecting particle, and its head is the verb "ska")
13. ska (sätta) - distance: 1 (ska is a modal verb, and its head is the verb "sätta")
14. man (sätta) - distance: 1 (man is the subject, and its head is the verb "sätta")
15. genast (sätta) - distance: 3 (genast is an adverb, and its head is the verb "sätta" / and not the adjacent or adjacent to immediate word if applicable)
16. sätta (den) - distance: 1 (sätta is a verb, and its head is the pronoun "den")
17. den (i) - distance: 1 (den is an object, and its head is the preposition "i")
18. i (karantän) - distance: 1 (i is a preposition, and its head is the noun "karantän")
19. karantän (alltså) - distance: 4 (this may depend on 'karantän' modifying 'alltså'; alltså below typically becomes just 1.)
20. alltså (genom) - distance: 1 (alltså is a connecting particle, and its head is the preposition "genom")
21. genom (att) - distance: 1 (this "genom" is a preposition, and its head is the infinitive marker "att")
22. att (dra) - distance: 1 (att is an infinitive marker, and its head is the verb "dra")
23. dra (ut) - distance: 1 (dra is a verb, and its head is the particle "ut")
24. ut (alla) - distance: 1 (ut is a particle, and its head is the determiner "alla")
25. alla (nätverkssladdar) - distance: 1 (alla is a determiner, and its head is the noun "nätverkssladdar")
26. nätverkssladdar (modem) - distance: 4  
   One can give many arguments here; it may be possible to write some grammars of certain linguistic  styles that can assign two main elements in a single 'och'. (, is just punctuation we move forward.) Some resources and tools to teach language / info extraction often may say its distance was 2
