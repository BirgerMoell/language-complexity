To calculate the average dependency distance, we need to identify the dependencies between tokens and the distance between each token and its head. 

Here's the given sentence with tokens numbered for ease of analysis:

1. Att
2. vi
3. lever
4. i
5. ett
6. demokratiskt
7. land
8. är
9. viktigt
10. därför
11. att
12. alla
13. har
14. rätt
15. att
16. ha
17. en
18. egen
19. åsikt
20. religion
21. etnisk
22. bakgrund
23. .

Token 1 'Att' has no head; it is a subordinating conjunction, but we will treat it as the head of this sentence for our purpose.

- Distance from 'vi' (2) to its head 'lever' (3) = 1
- Distance from 'lever' (3) to its head 'att' (1) = 2
- Distance from 'i' (4) to its head 'lever' (3) = 1
- Distance from 'ett' (5) to its head 'demokratiskt' (6) = 1
- Distance from 'demokratiskt' (6) to its head 'land' (7) = 1
- Distance from 'land' (7) to its head 'lever' (3) = 4
- Distance from 'är' (8) to its head 'lever' (3) = 5, due to 'lever' being implied in the prior sentence in order to enable the connection between 'lever' and its supplementary effect in, 'är'.
- Distance from 'viktigt' (9) to its head 'är' (8) = 1
- Distance from 'därför' (10) to its head 'att' (11) = 1
- Distance from 'att' (11) to its head 'viktigt' (9) = 2, essentially an adverb modifying this statement
- Distance from 'alla' (12) to its head 'har' (13) = 1
- Distance from 'har' (13) to its head 'att' (11) = 2
- Distance from 'rätt' (14) to its head 'har' (13) = 1
- Distance from 'att' (15) to its head 'rätt' (14) = 1
- Distance from 'ha' (16) to its head 'att' (15) = 1
- Distance from 'en' (17) to its head 'egen' (18) = 1 
- Distance from 'egen' (18) to its head 'åsikt' (19) = 1 
- Distance from 'åsikt' (19) to its head 'ha' (16) = 3
- Distance from 'religion' (20) to its head 'ha' (16) = 4, due to a comma not being used for separation of more than one aspect
- Distance from 'etnisk' (21) to its head 'bakgrund' (22) = 1 
- Distance from 'bakgrund' (22) to its head 'ha' (16) = 5, (due to a comma not being used for separation of more than one aspect)
- Distance from '.' (23) to its head 'ha' (16) = 7

Calculating the average dependency distance:

(1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 + 4 + 1 + 5 + 7) / 23 = 47 / 23 ≈ 2.04

The average dependency distance of the sentence is approximately 2.04.
