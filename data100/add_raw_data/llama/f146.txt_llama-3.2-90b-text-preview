To calculate the average dependency distance in the given sentence, we first need to identify the head of each token. Let's break down the sentence into its components and identify the head of each token:


1. Anledningen (head of 'Anledningen' is 'beror', dependency distance = 14)
2. till (head of 'till' is 'Anledningen', dependency distance = 1)
3. att (head of 'att' is 'till', dependency distance = 1)
4. Sverige (head of 'Sverige' is 'har', dependency distance = 1)
5. har (head of 'har' is 'beror', dependency distance = 10)
6. relativt (head of 'relativt' is 'varmt', dependency distance = 1)
7. varmt (head of 'varmt' is 'har', dependency distance = 1, with 'relativt' as intermediate dependency, effective distance = 2)
8. klimat (head of 'klimat' is 'har', dependency distance = 3, with 'relativt' and 'varmt' as intermediate dependencies, effective distance = 4)
9. ( (head of '(' is not applicable in this case)
10. om (head of 'om' is 'jämför', dependency distance = 2)
11. man (head of 'man' is 'jämför', dependency distance = 1) 
12. jämför (head of 'jämför' is 'beror', dependency distance = 9, with the tokens within parentheses considered a subordinate clause)
13. med (head of 'med' is 'jämför', dependency distance = 1)
14. andra (head of 'andra' is 'länder', dependency distance = 1)
15. länder (head of 'länder' is 'jämför', dependency distance = 2)
16. på (head of 'på' is 'jämför', dependency distance = 1)
17. samma (head of 'samma' is 'breddgrad', dependency distance = 1)
18. breddgrad (head of 'breddgrad' is 'jämför', dependency distance = 2)
19. ) (head of ')' is not applicable in this case)
20. beror (head of 'beror' is 'Anledningen', dependency distance = 1, not applicable here, as 'beror' is the main head verb)
21. på (head of 'på' is 'beror', dependency distance = 1)
22. Golfströmmen (head of 'Golfströmmen' is 'beror', dependency distance = 2)

Now, let's calculate the average dependency distance for tokens in the given sentence. Effective distance is used in some cases.


 The sum of the dependency distances for all tokens (except for punctuation and some heads) in the sentence is: 
 14 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 10 + 1 + 2 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 9 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 62.

 The total number of dependencies (excluding punctuation and certain heads) is 22 (number is 21 + 1 for 'beror', no effective distante, rather just a distance for being governed by itself),


 thus, the average dependency distance is: 
 62/21 ≈ 2.95
