Let's analyze the Swedish sentence and calculate the average dependency distance. First, we need to identify the dependencies between the tokens. Here's the sentence broken down:

1. Så (adverb) - head: should be the main clause (därför...bättre)
   - Dependency distance: 1

2. därför (adverb) - head: skulle
   - Dependency distance: 1

3. skulle (verb) - head: be the main clause (ju...bättre)
   - Dependency distance: 2 (but in the end it is the head, please see further)

4. ju (adverb) - head: skulle
   - Dependency distance: 1

5. det (pronoun) - head: skulle
   - Dependency distance: 1

6. vara (verb) - head: skulle
   - Dependency distance: 1

7. bättre (adjective) - head: vara
   - Dependency distance: 1

8. att (particle) - head: bättre (part of an infinitive construction)
   - Dependency distance: 1

9. bo (verb) - head: bättre
   - Dependency distance: 2 (bo is the verb, whereas bättre is the adjectival head)

10. vid (preposition) - head: andra
    - Dependency distance: 1

11. andra (determiner) - head: floder
    - Dependency distance: 1

12. floder (noun) - head: bo
    - Dependency distance: 3

13. som (preposition) - head: floder (in a subordinate comparative clause)
    - Dependency distance: 1

14. nilen (noun) - head: bo
    - Dependency distance (via 'som floder') or 'floder (head) somnilen' nilen is actually dependent on floder in certain representations. Alternatively, you can consider 'floder som nilen' or floder and nilen having as their core bo. (bo... floder som nilen) To establish it properly via either 
    'floder' or '(floderbo), let's look at the Nilens case or 
    the head. 
    - Dependency distance, to be estimated: approximately 3 or 5 hence averaging this to: 3+5= 8, 8/2 = 4. 

15. . (punctuation mark) - head: ikke clear from this line though assume this (the verb which appears in 6 'vara')
   - Dependency distance: The verb has dependency of 1 and this has a current line dependency of 6 which would not strictly be logical would this seem appropriate here, although  was asked we do take the   verb dependency here and place 8 for line dependency, taking average dependency out of both estimates. (6+8)/2 =7 it can’t be reasonably less or greater than the dependency used there given being line dependency to a degree this increases that verb line and also used with distance assumed from usage perspective used.


Now we have identified the dependencies. Now we calculate the average dependency distance:

Dependency distance sum: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 4 + 3 + 7 = 27 

Number of tokens (excluding the punctuation mark): 14 

So the average dependency distance is 27 / 14 = 1.93
