To analyze the sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we need to identify the tokens, their parts of speech, and their grammatical dependencies. We will use the sentence in English as you provided it. Please note that I will analyze it based on a simplified dependency analysis model.

 Tokens and heads:
 
1. This (pronoun) - head: led
2. led (verb) - head: -
3. to (preposition) - head: questions
4. questions (noun) - head: led
5. about (preposition) - head: questions
6. how (adverb) - head: is
7. the (article) - head: logistics
8. outbound (adjective) - head: logistics
9. logistics (noun) - head: is
10. is (verb) - head: led
11. planned (verb) - head: is
12. in (preposition) - head: Zwolle
13. Zwolle (proper noun) - head: in
14. today (noun) - head: and
15. , (comma) - head: and
16. and (conjunction) - head: led
17. how (adverb) - head: can
18. it (pronoun) - head: be
19. can (verb) - head: how (18 was re-labeled as the head of 'it')
18. be (verb) - head: can
20. planned (verb) - head: can
21. in (preposition) - head: future
22. the (article) - head: future
23. future (noun) - head: in
24. with (preposition) - head: can
25. increased (verb) - head: production
25's label was changed so 'with' now is a head to 'production'
26. production (noun) - head: can
26 was assigned to 'with'
27. volumes (noun) - head: production
   . (full stop) - head: - 

 Calculating the average dependency distance:
 
1. This - led: 1
2. led - no head
3. to - questions: 1
4. questions - led: 2
5. about - questions: 1
6. how - is: 1
7. the - logistics: 1
8. outbound - logistics: 1
9. logistics - is: 2
10. is - led: 1
11. planned - is: 1
12. in - Zwolle: 1 ( Zwolle not being the correct head, given this particular analysis Zwolle's head is changed to 'in' in planned in Zwolle)
13. Zwolle - in: 1 
14. today - and: 3 (re-label  'and' is in fact 'and' with respect to the compound structure of the two clauses)
15. , - and: 1
16. and - led: 6
17. how - can: 1
18. it - how: 1
19. can - how: 1
20. be - can: 1
21. planned - can: 1
22. in - future: 1
23. the - future: 1
24. future - in: 1
25. with - can (previously assigned): 1 to 'can' where later this decision is amended 
26. production - can (previously assigned): but correctly labeled -  can be broken down to 2 
 prior amending the decision 
27 volumes - production - 3 

DepDist: = | (27 Distances) | .
(35distances)/ = (/1+2*4)/(27)=105 / 27 = 3.888
