To calculate the average dependency distance, we first need to parse the sentence and identify the grammatical dependencies. Here's a possible parse:

1. Som - modifier (dependent on) 'metod'
   - 'Som' is a preposition and its head is 'metod', so the distance is 1 (from 'Som' to 'metod')
   
2. metod - root 
   - no dependency distance calculated for the root.

3. valdes - dependent on 'metod', but 'som' in Swedish can invert word order so assuming head is correctly tagged 'Metod valdes' -> 'metod'(subtree root)  has no child- is head  and valdes is dependent  but since valdes  verb   comes close in sequence after inverted word order due to "som". Take valdes is dependent and head of 'Som', assume is 2 but 1 token  -  ignore distance in inversion, distance  of  valdes  is one.

4. att - dependent on 'studera', 
   - The distance from 'att' to 'studera' is 3.

5. studera - dependent on 'valdes'
   - 'studera' is the main verb of the clause; the distance to 'valdes' is 2.

6. befintliga - dependent on 'arbetsprocesser'
   - 'befintliga' is an adjective; the distance to 'arbetsprocesser' is 1.

7. arbetsprocesser - dependent on 'studera'
   - The distance from 'arbetsprocesser' to 'studera' is 3.

8. på - dependent on 'Scania'
   - 'på' is a preposition; the distance from 'på' to 'Scania' is 1.

9. Scania - dependent on 'arbetsprocesser' 
   - The distance from 'Scania' to 'arbetsprocesser' is 2.

10. samt - dependent on 'att' 
    - coordinating conjunction
    - The distance from 'samt' to 'att' ( actually 'att is first with 'valdes  semanticaly linked) has dependency that conjunction simply has close appraches head just prior : distance is 2 or choose from head valdes  inverted to -  since close assume 1.

11. att - second instance 
    -> The parent for utföra's dependency will be valdes -> should be head/ assume 
        (assuming is same as dependency for first 'att', distance is assumed 3 like for first).

12. utföra - dependent on 'valdes'
    - The distance from 'utföra' to 'valdes' is 3.

13. semistrukturerade - dependent on 'intervjuer'
    - 'semistrukturerade' is an adjective; the distance to 'intervjuer' is 2.

14. intervjuer - dependent on 'utföra'
    - The distance from 'intervjuer' to 'utföra' is 2.

15. med - dependent on 'intervjuer' 
    - The distance from 'med' to 'intervjuer' is 1.

16. personer - dependent on 'intervjuer' (However note direct could choose som linked particpality / still "som" may conected from 'med' that particl and distance 2):
    2. ignoring this dependency part just to make is realis to particles will assume distance of 2

17. i - dependent on 'personer' : token just the preps 
    -  + then prephead func. 1
    preps given just   is prep-> Preps

18. funktioner - dependent on 'personer'
    - 1. It follows  the preposiions func
    dependency 1 or when a particl. link or part. makes same kind of prep-> prep linkage not by a real - funtion  
    you got

19. inom - dependent on 'motor' 
    - in, 1,
    dependency - of inom. prep or 'funktioner if som partci more 

20. motor -> dependent on 'funktioner' 
    dependency,  for prep 
    - prep-> then after prep head - to two head dep have: 

21. idag - dependent on 'arbetar'
    - 2.

22. arbetar - dependent on 'personer' OR  'utföra/ valdes linked'
    assume latter i.e. either for better particl or not an indepentent: 
    although its dependency is dependent have choice particl  function it has , 1.

23. som -  conjunction 2 -> 
    The dependency still dependent on arbetar but dependent conjunction,
    dependency
