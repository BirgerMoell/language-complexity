Let's break down the sentence into tokens and calculate the dependency distances.

Tokens: 
1. Fördelar
2. &
3. nackdelar
4. USB
5. -
6. fördelar
7. Implementerad
8. standard
9. i
10. PC
11. och
12. som
13. har
14. stort
15. operativssystemsstöd
16. ,
17. i
18. t

We assume the main verb of this sentence is 'har', although the sentence seems incomplete. It also contains a sublist with 'Implementerad', 'fördelar' is likely not a main clause verb, rather than a title or header for the sentence or forthcoming information. The main dependency will likely stem from 'har', but there could be other dependencies. 

Here are a few assumptions regarding the dependencies:
- 'Fördelar' and 'nackdelar' are titles, they could be linked with '&' (dependency distance 1) and USB (dependency distance 2 for 'nackdelar').
- 'Implementerad' seems to be linked to 'standard' (dependency distance 1), and 'standard' is linked with 'i' which is linked to 'PC' and also dependent on 'har' (dependency distance 3).
- 'som' might be linked to 'PC' or more likely 'operativssystemsstöd', but is dependent on 'har' (dependency distance 3 for 'som' not linked directly to 'operativssystemsstöd').
- 'har' is likely the main verb 'har' (dependency distance 0 for a verb governing all other structures on a theoretical hierarchical stack). Also we can directly connect 'stort' with 'operativssystemsstöd' with dependency distance of 1.
- Full stop and comma at the end makes it the part of the sentence but dependencies from there are more likely to be 0 ( the verb not governed by these punctuation) or we might as well exclude them since here roles will mainly influence where  non existent verb exists.

Dependency Distances (Assuming that above ones indeed take place and 'har' major governing parent including others: it, stort, operativssystöd, som): 
- 1 (Fördelar-& and &-Fördelar)  
- 1 (nackdelar-USB) since '&' likely will not point other ones
- 1 ('Implementerad' - standard)
- 1 (i -PC or i PC based som / som PC split 'som' & PC)
- 1 ( och - *above)
- 1 ( och might point stort which operates with great variability, i.e., a stretch concerning som. Thus 1)
- 1 (the 'stort' with its master and governor head and key 'operativssystemsstöd' it)
- 1 (Fördelar title next  not pointing other items)
- 2 (nackdelar-USB)
- 2 i- PC   'standard' not able to govern but is under greater ' i which is able to rule other and is able to link more under it.)
  thus under tree for all items could look. 3 ('har' rule most) it seems we already crossed three.
- 2 ('fördelar' next title here linking its further and has distance 2')
- Assume 'har' rule these all.
   Total for possible Govern=29 in summary
