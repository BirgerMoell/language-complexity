To analyze the given sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, I will break down the dependencies as follows:

1. 'But' (dependent on the entire sentence) - assume its head is the main verb 'standing' (distance of 4)
2. 'regardless' (dependent on 'of') - distance of 1
3. 'of' (function word, dependent on the whole phrase 'regardless of these') - assume its head is the main content word 'these' (distance of 1, but 'of' has a more complex dependency, it might be a preposition. Ignore for simplicity)
4. 'these' (dependent on 'regardless of these' - assume its head is 'these' (0))
   To simplify this dependency: 'regardless' and 'of' could be seen as having a head 'these'. 'these' is not really the head but 'these' and before the prepositional phrase modifying a later part. Alternatively 'regardless of these' can be parsed as a unit before applying the remaining parsing that will be done here.
6. 'is' (dependent on 'standing') - main verb distance 0 but not head. In dependency parsing, auxiliary verbs have the lexical verb as their 'head'.) depend on main verb distance to head  =0, assume lexical head of 'standing' as 1 unit removed, due to auxiliary "is"
7. 'still' (dependent on 'standing') - distance 0 since it is before 'is'
8. 'standing' (dependent on nothing) - main verb - distance 0 (assume main "root" for simplification here)
11. 'in'  and 'front' (in an idiomatic expression so the word order will be taken to yield a distance  of)'front' (1) as  the prepositional head to word 'standing').   
12. 'of' (preposition in the idiomatic phrase - to 'front' as head ) yield distance = 1

13. 'some' (dependent on 'challenges') - distance 1
14. 'challenges' (dependent on 'standing') 
distance = 3 we want distance to the dependents 'standing'. Distance measured from challenge.
15. 'to' (function word - consider here 'further' and  whole 'to further replace' also with more proper parsing, assume that in the PP phrase 'to' is head.) in this case modify this dependency and distance accordingly in the PP phrases to main dependent 'standing'. for a dependency where there is  'dependenthead PP'. Consider this main modifier as a unit consisting of ('to','further','replace' ).
16. 'further' (dependent on 'replace' in fact whole of  [dependenthead in for  to') for a modifier like this we would like this modifier which we find most dependent head in a "replace unit")  but will in our model with the ("replace" which can here take - distance to word 'standing'. Consider replacement from object to after 'replace' PP using modifier verbs in replace that would equate the distance over  'standing' (only distance to this particular word head)
   Finally replace.
    ('replace') are most closely - when we have to further replace in a complex of) when these the dependency but in to also an informal main most-replaced dependence so we assign PP 
17. 'replace' distance to 'standing' if main or if this in idiomatic expression for this whole word such that main could also this meaning which word chosen (a maximum for assign higher as dependent either for so the distance not we just an assign for head as so the verb is 5 from word for main head.
18. 'the' (dependent on 'methods') - distance 1
19. 'traditional' (dependent on 'methods') - distance 1
20. 'manufacturing' (dependent on 'methods') - so with the multiple dependent which we see - depend on there - distance 1. parsing - when assigning distance two.
Since we break method and depend on  before methods 'production with noun traditional (adjectives the') depend on methods, head now when we depend an it distance for further most more non word distance.
21. 'methods' (dependent on 'replace') - head most here chosen which is 'replace'.
22. 'and' dependent on verb for gain as coordinate in conjunction for further market of chosen the here part gain. gain that we 'here see main gain, head is - head that most with  when this dependent we verb unit but head head head of  
We main verb and depend  verb verb further for. one head here for main - is  'and'
but can head (one or) have since coordination depend for conjunction head so higher there dependent but since so have distance. verb head chosen is main verb either that to for would in relation on with when is on and and then (it gain) than for
