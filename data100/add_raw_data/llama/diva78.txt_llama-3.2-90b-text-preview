To calculate the average dependency distance of the given sentence, we first need to identify the head words and their dependencies. Let's break down the sentence 'Det är en utrustning med vilken man genom att fysiskt translatera och rotera en testperson kan stimulera hjärnan hos denna person.'

1. 'Det' - head is 'är', distance = 1
2. 'är' - head is 'utrustning' (complex sentence, 'är' is a copula connecting 'det' to 'utrustning', or an auxiliary to the main verb in the dependent clause, acting as a semi-verbal link), distance = 2
   (This interpretation relies on individual perspectives and grammar interpretation.)
3. 'en' - head is 'utrustning', distance = 1
4. 'utrustning' - (main verb, dependent on the auxiliary 'är') distance not counted
5. 'med' - (preposition not typically assigned a head, except the head phrase depending on),  ('utrustning') distance not counted
6. 'vilken' - head is 'utrustning', ('vilken' connects to a new subordinate clause), distance = 1 
   (A more thorough linguistic understanding may be beneficial here; complexities lie with handling pronouns standing as full phrases within sentences).
7. 'man' - head is 'kan', ('man' connects to subclause), distance = 4
8. 'genom' - head is 'kan' (complex meaning), distance not counted, same reasoning as above
9. 'att' - head is 'kan' (connects an infinite subclause) distance not counted, related function as other less-verbalized particles/substitutes in grammatic formulations influencing sentence sense..
10. 'fysiskt' - head is 'translatera', (description word head; same reason: non-count),  distance not counted
11. 'translatera' - head is 'kan', and also 'rotera' since coordinate verb, distance = 2, and =2
12. 'och' - does not modify other units necessarily counted itself; acting to bind the grouped conjunct trans: distance not counted
13. 'rotera' - head is 'kan', same reason for coordination shown with 'fysiskt', distance = 2
14. 'en' - head is 'testperson', distance = 1
15. 'testperson' - head is 'translatera', or 'rotera' same reason, distance = 2
16. 'kan' - head is 'stimulera' head connection = main operational dependency (root), but also head to 'utrustning' per entire utterance direction logic by dependency ordering formulations with indirect subjects),  head to verb chain not counted since is verb main line..
17. 'stimulera' - head is 'hos' to a new structure as logical path ('det...' this now indicates non-nuclear dependency line) or alternatively following operational main and direct word relation to last utter group forming this conclusion), let alone this current grouping,  (stimulera logical function verb):not part of subject line to objective),   distance of  'stimulera' (depending head dependent relations ('utrustning' final object):no measure utilized, with complexity forming sub clauses).
18. 'hjärnan' (object targeted by simulative form in motion), head is 'stimulera', distance = 1
19. 'hos' - head is not utilized counted but other higher form 'utrustning', related part determining dependency (does not get an established dependency direction number here).
20. 'denna' - head is 'person', distance = 1
21. 'person' - head is 'hos', or distance = 1 

average dependency distance calculated;   (if unclear or requiring understanding then please do consult a higher linguistic work specifically focused linguistics)  :
Sum of valid dependency distances: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 19 
Number of valid dependency distances: 13 
Average of dependencies = 19 / 13 = 1.46
