To analyze the given Swedish sentence and calculate the average dependency distance, we first need to identify the tokens, their heads, and the corresponding dependency distances. 

Here's the breakdown:

1. Especially - This is an adverb and can be considered as modifying the entire sentence. Assuming its head is 'want', the distance is 3.
2. I - Its head is 'want', and the distance is 1.
3. want - It's the head of the sentence. 
4. to - This is a preposition, its head is 'thank', the distance is 3.
5. thank - Its head is 'want' and the distance is 2.
6. My - Its head is 'supervisor' and the distance is 2.
7. academic - Its head is 'supervisor' and the distance is 1.
8. supervisor - Its head is 'thank' and the distance is 3.
9. Martin - Its head is 'supervisor' and the distance is 1.

13. a - Its head is 'workload' and the distance is 2.
14. heavy - Its head is 'workload' and the distance is 1.

25. help - Its head is 'and' and the distance is 1.
26. with - This is a preposition, its head is 'help' and the distance is 1 (but also its head is 'contributed' in a different way in the overall context, distance 4 but again absolute value).
27. this - Its head is 'thesis' and the distance is 2.
28. thesis - Its head is 'help' and the distance is 2.
29. . - Its head is 'want' (the root) and the distance is 5 (absolute value), though we could choose not to consider punctuation.

Average dependency distance:
(3 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 5 + 3 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 1 + 4 + 5 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2) / 28.
