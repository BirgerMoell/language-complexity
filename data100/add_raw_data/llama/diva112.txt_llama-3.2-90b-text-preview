To calculate the average dependency distance, we first need to determine the syntactic dependencies in the sentence. Here is a possible analysis:

1. Vidare (adverb) is a dependent of utvärderas (verb), its head, at a distance of 1.
2. utvärderas (verb) is the main verb of the sentence, its head is not explicitly stated in this sentence but we assume it as the head, at a distance of 0.
3. om (subordinating conjunction) is a dependent of utvärderas (verb), its head, at a distance of 2.
4. valda (attribute) is a dependent of åtgärder (noun), its head, at a distance of 1.
5. åtgärder (noun) is a dependent of utvärderas (verb), its head, at a distance of 3.
6. har (auxiliary verb) is a dependent of utvärderas (verb), its head, at a distance of 4.
7. en (determiner) is a dependent of negativ (adjective), its head is actually inverkan (noun) at a distance of 3.
   correction of previous line: en (determiner) is more likely a dependent of negativ (adjective),  but the main head for  'en' will be actually  inverkan  (at a distance of 3).
8. negativ (adjective) is a dependent of inverkan (noun), at a distance of 2.
9. inverkan (noun) is a dependent of har (auxiliary verb), its head, at a distance of 1.
10. per (preposition) is a dependent of byggnadsdel (noun), its head, but  actually head is 'inverkan'  -   at a distance of 2. correction - the head of 'per' is indeed  inverkan and  the head of 'byggnadsdel' is per. 
11. byggnadsdel (noun) is a dependent of inverkan (main head) not of  'per'  but it will show from 'ur' (preposition), its head (mainly inverkan)  at a distance of 1.  correction the head of 'byggnadsdel' is 'per'.
12. ur (preposition) is a dependent of fuktsynpunkt (noun), its head, at a distance of 1. the main head is inverkan  Head for 'ur' is indeed fuktsynpunkt,  previous   assumed  correction that head  is 'inverkan'. 
   the main correction is  head for 'ur' =  fuktsynpunkt, for 'byggnadsdel' = 'per'  per head = inverkan and not for its head fuktsynpunkt
   for sentence by now correct tokens till 'per'
13. ur is corrected now and not main for byggnadsdel
  other tokens 
14. och (conjunction) is a dependent of visas (verb), its head, at a distance of 5  for separation has to be performed first  for this portion.
15. slutligen (adverb)  is a dependent of visas (verb), its head, at a distance of 1.
16. visas (main verb for this portion of sentence ) is dependent of utvärderas for sentence structure, thus we assign distance =  8 now.
17. att (subordinating conjunction) is a dependent of visas (verb)  with 1- then not needs more longer dependencies we start  a unit called  that "många"  with  'att'.
18. många (determiner, quantifier) is a dependent of åtgärderna (noun), its main head at a distance of 2,
19. av (preposition) is a dependent of åtgärderna (noun), its head, but indeed the sub-phrase head  of the 'många-av' is actually not head  for portion then assigns is   from its main head  then consider - många and that distance  is  i+1  3 so perform head "ur+ekonomisk+perspektiv"  = now unit   ->from "många", then    "många" +  " av " = 'många av' having one for distance "många" .
   since the portions was unclear on reading preposition were found sub -after   head (assign distance according to reading (att)+ next token now   -> 'många', distance is 2 .
    and assign 1 then unit then assign values 
    because assign  all portions and value for   'många+ av' head
