To construct a dependency tree from the provided Swedish sentence, I will first identify the grammatical structure of the sentence, including the verbs, subjects, objects, and their relationships. The sentence is quite complex, with multiple clauses and a notable conjunction (“för att”) indicating causation.

Here’s how I break down the sentence:

1. **Identify the main verb:** The primary action in the sentence is "lär" (learn). It acts as the main verb in the latter part of the sentence.
  
2. **Determine the subject:** The subject of "lär" is "man," which refers to "one" or a general person.

3. **Subordinate Clauses:** The phrase starting with “Även om” (Even though) sets a conditional or contrasting clause with “det” (it) as an existential subject.

4. **Identify objects and complements:** The phrases “att man som 2-åring lär sig” conveys that the subject learns something (to not run into a tree), with "sig" (oneself) acting as a reflexive pronoun.

5. **Causal Relationship:** The clause “för att man får väldigt ont då” indicates why the learning is necessary.

Now, let's construct the dependency tree based on this analysis. Each token will be indexed with its relationship to the head token.

Here's the structure of the sentence in an indexed format:

1. Även (a conjunction)
2. om (a preposition)
3. det (subject)
4. rör (verb)
5. sig (reflexive pronoun)
6. om (preposition)
7. att (conjunction)
8. man (subject of "lär")
9. som (relative pronoun)
10. 2-åring (noun)
11. lär (main verb)
12. sig (reflexive pronoun)
13. att (conjunction)
14. inte (negation)
15. springa (infinitive verb)
16. in (adverb)
17. ett (determiner)
18. träd (object)
19. för (preposition)
20. att (conjunction)
21. man (subject)
22. får (verb)
23. väldigt (adverb)
24. ont (adjective)
25. då (adverb)

Now mapping it to the dependency structure:

- The root of the tree is "lär" (index 11).
- "man" (index 8) is the subject of "lär," which is a dependent.
- "att", "inte", "springa" branches off of "lär" as an infinitive clause.
- "rör" serves as a verb for "det" which is in a subordinate clause linked to "om".
- The phrase “för att” indicates a purpose, connecting “man” (index 21) to a secondary action.

Based on the analysis, the final dependency tree should look like this:

```plaintext
[
    (1, Även, 6), 
    (2, om, 4), 
    (3, det, 4), 
    (4, rör, 0), 
    (5, sig, 4), 
    (6, om, 4), 
    (7, att, 11), 
    (8, man, 11), 
    (9, som, 10), 
    (10, 2-åring, 8), 
    (11, lär, 4), 
    (12, sig, 11), 
    (13, att, 14), 
    (14, inte, 15), 
    (15, springa, 12), 
    (16, in, 15), 
    (17, ett, 18), 
    (18, träd, 15), 
    (19, för, 21), 
    (20, att, 22), 
    (21, man, 22), 
    (22, får, 0), 
    (23, väldigt, 24), 
    (24, ont, 22), 
    (25, då, 22)
]
```

This representation provides a clear mapping of the grammatical dependencies among the tokens in the sentence. Each tuple represents the position of a token, its content, and its corresponding head index.
