To analyze the given Swedish sentence "Urbaniseringen, som detta kallas, har gjort så att hälften av dagens befolkning bor i de femton största städerna," we need to identify the parts of the sentence and their linguistic relationships to construct a dependency tree.

1. **Identify Tokens**: The first step is to tokenize the sentence. We'll include non-alphabetic characters such as commas and spaces as separate tokens.
   - Tokens: Urbaniseringen, som, detta, kallas, har, gjort, så, att, hälften, av, dagens, befolkning, bor, i, de, femton, största, städerna.

2. **Determine Grammatical Relationships**: Next, we identify the relationships between these words:
   - "Urbaniseringen" is the subject of "har gjort."
   - "som" introduces a relative clause modifying "Urbaniseringen."
   - "detta kallas" serves as a relative clause, meaning "this is called."
   - "har" (to have) is the main verb.
   - "gjort" (done) carries the past participle meaning.
   - "så att" (so that) introduces a clause explaining the effect.
   - "hälften" (half) is the subject of the clause "hälften av dagens befolkning bor."
   - "av" (of) indicates possession for "dagens befolkning."
   - "bor" (lives) is in turn the verb that relates to "hälften."
   - "i" (in) relates to the location of "de femton största städerna."
   - Finally, "de femton största städerna" acts as the direct object of "bor."

3. **Construct Index and Head Relationships**: Now translate these relationships into index-based dependencies:
   - (1, Urbaniseringen, 4) → "Urbaniseringen" is the subject of "gjort" (the head of the tree here is the main verb).
   - (2, som, 1) → "som" modifies "Urbaniseringen."
   - (3, detta, 4) → "detta" is the subject of "kallas."
   - (4, kallas, 2) → "kallas" is related as part of the clause about "Urbaniseringen."
   - (5, har, 6) → "har" is the main verb.
   - (6, gjort, 0) → "gjort" is the root of the main action.
   - (7, så, 6) → "så" is dependent on "gjort."
   - (8, att, 7) → "att" introduces a purpose clause based on "så."
   - (9, hälften, 11) → "hälften" is the subject of "bor."
   - (10, av, 9) → "av" links to "hälften."
   - (11, dagens, 10) → "dagens" modifies "befolkning."
   - (12, befolkning, 9) → "befolkning" is part of what "hälften" relates to.
   - (13, bor, 8) → "bor" is the verb in the subordinate clause.
   - (14, i, 13) → "i" indicates location for "bor."
   - (15, de, 17) → "de" introduces the determinative for "största städerna."
   - (16, femton, 17) → "femton" modifies "största."
   - (17, största, 13) → "största" modifies "städerna."
   - (18, städerna, 14) → "städerna" is the object of the preposition "i."

4. **Finalize Dependency Relationships into Tree Format**: Collecting these relationships gives us:
```
[
    (1, Urbaniseringen, 4),
    (2, som, 1),
    (3, detta, 4),
    (4, kallas, 2),
    (5, har, 6),
    (6, gjort, 0),
    (7, så, 6),
    (8, att, 7),
    (9, hälften, 11),
    (10, av, 9),
    (11, dagens, 10),
    (12, befolkning, 9),
    (13, bor, 8),
    (14, i, 13),
    (15, de, 17),
    (16, femton, 17),
    (17, största, 13),
    (18, städerna, 14)
]
```

Now, this output reflects the dependencies of the sentence. Each token is indexed, and its grammatical head is clearly established, following the principles of dependency grammar.
