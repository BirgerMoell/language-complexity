To create a dependency tree for the given Swedish sentence, we'll break it down into its constituent parts. Here's the analysis:

1. Urbaniseringen (Urbanization, the thing being referred to) - This is the main noun phrase.
   * Urbaniseringen is a subject and depends on the verb "har gjort" (has done), so its head will be "gjort" (8).

2. Som detta kallas (which is called this) - This is a non-restrictive relative clause describing "Urbaniseringen".
   * "Som" (which) is a pronoun and depends on "kallas" (is called), so its head will be "kallas" (4).
   * "denna" or similar is missing after "som", so "detta" is an apposition and depends on "Urbaniseringen", so its head will be "Urbaniseringen" (1).

3. Har gjort (has done) - This is the main verb phrase.
   * This is the main verb and depends on no other word, so its head will be "0" (the root).

4. Så att (so that) - This is an adverbial phrase modifying "gjort".
   * "så" and "att" both depend on "gjort", so their head will be "gjort" (8).

5. Hälften av dagens befolkning (half of today's population) - This is a noun phrase acting as an adverbial phrase.
   * "hälften" is a pronoun and depends on no other word in this case but since it clearly is modifying the action of "gjort", it will depend on "gjort", (8).
   * "av" is a preposition and depends on "hälften", so its head will be "hälften" (6).
   * "dagens" is a possessive adjective and depends on "befolkning" but is modifying the larger phrase of which the head is "gjort", we don't want to create cycles so "befolkning" will depend on "hälften" (6).
   * "befolkning" is the head of this whole group in a different tree but here it will depend on "hälften".

6. Bor i de femton största städerna (lives in the fifteen biggest cities) - This is the main verb phrase.
   * "bor" is the main verb and depends on "hänföra sig till" is implied in Swedish and that will depend on "gjort" (8), the idea being that living somewhere is an action implied by 'gjort'.

Now let's break down the full sentence into our token format:

Urbaniseringen (1), som (2), detta (3), kallas (4), har (5), gjort (8), så (9), att (10), hälften (6), av (11), dagens (7), befolkning (12), bor (13), i (14), de (15), femton (16), största (17), städerna (18)

Now we construct our dependency tree:

(1, Urbaniseringen, 8)
(2, som, 4)
(3, detta, 1)
(4, kallas, 8)
(5, har, 8)
(6, hälften, 8)
(7, dagens, 6)
(8, gjort, 0)
(9, så, 8)
(10, att, 8)
(11, av, 6)
(12, befolkning, 6)
(13, bor, 8)
(14, i, 13)
(15, de, 18)
(16, femton, 18)
(17, största, 18)
(18, städerna, 13)

Note that this analysis is simplified and may not reflect the full complexity of the Swedish language or a human's understanding of the sentence's meaning.
