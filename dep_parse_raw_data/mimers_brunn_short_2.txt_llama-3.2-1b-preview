To analyze the sentence and produce a dependency tree, I'll go through it step by step. Here's my analysis:

1. The sentence is: "Efter 2: a världskriget så bestämde sig 51 länder att bilda FN, Förenta nationerna."

   - I start from the 1st token, which is "Efter". This is a non-whitespace token, and the head token of the sentence is "Efter".
   - The next token is "2". This token belongs to the sub-declarations (paragraffer) that start after an adverb phrase.
   - The colon (:) separates the sub-declarations and acts as an introductory phrase marker.
   - The sub-declarations continue until "a världskriget".

2. The sub-declarations that start after "a världskriget" can be written as "A: bokredigande".

   - I start from the 1st node again, which is "A". This is a non-whitespace token, and it has no head token.
   - The token "bok" has 5 indices (0, 1, 2, 3, 4). The next token is "redigande", which also belongs to "A" and has 2 indices (0, 1).
   - "Bok" and "redigande" are both non-whitespace tokens.

3. The next sub-declarations are "Förenta nationerna".

   - I start from the 4th node, which is "Förenta nationerna". This token has 2 indices (0, 1).
   - This sub-declaration is a noun phrase, and the head token is "nationerna".

4. The final sub-declarations are "51".

   - I start from the 7th node, which is "51". This token has no head token, but it's part of a larger noun phrase.

Now, let's represent the dependency tree:

- Efter (head token)
  - 1: 2 (sub-declaration after adverb phrase)
  - A: [bok] (sub-declaration)
  - A[1]: [redigande] (sub-declaration)
  - Bok[0]: [världskriget] (sub-declaration)
  - Förenta nationerna[0]: [nationerna] (noun phrase)

Note: As per your request, I did not include the indices in the sub-declarations since they are integers and may not be meaningful in this context. However, they are present in the dependency tree for completeness.
