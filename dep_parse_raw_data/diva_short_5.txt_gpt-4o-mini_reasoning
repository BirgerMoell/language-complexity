To produce a dependency tree for the given Swedish sentence, we first need to analyze the grammatical structure of the sentence. We identify the main clause and its components, as well as subordinate clauses, prepositional phrases, and any coordinating conjunctions. Here's a breakdown of the sentence:

1. The main verb is **"fann"**, which is the past tense of "finnas" (to find). It serves as the root of the sentence.
2. The subject of the main verb **"fann"** is **"jag"** (I).
3. **"När"** introduces a subordinate temporal clause, indicating when the action took place. 
4. Inside the temporal clause, **"gick"** (went) is the main verb, with **"jag"** (I) as its subject.
5. **"över statistik om emigration från Vallonien"** is a prepositional phrase connected to **"gick"**, indicating what the subject was going over.
6. **"att Sverige var bland de fem regioner dit vallonerna flyttat till mest"** is another clause that follows **"fann"** – a complement clause describing what was found. 
7. Within this clause, **"Sverige"** (Sweden) is a subject, **"var"** (was) is the verb, and **"bland de fem regioner"** provides additional information about the subject.
8. There are also several appositives and a list mentioned at the end of the sentence (Flandern, Brasilien, Argentina, och USA).

Now let's construct the dependency tree:

- Root is "fann" (index 6).
- Subject "jag" (index 2) depends on "fann".
- The temporal clause beginning with "När" (index 1) depends on "jag".
- Inside the temporal clause, "gick" (index 3) depends on "jag".
- "över" (index 4) is a preposition that depends on "gick" and takes "statistik" (index 5) as a complement.
- "statistik" takes "om" (index 8) as a modifier with "emigration" (index 7) as its object.
- "från" (index 9) is another preposition used with "Vallonien" (index 10).
- The main clause from "fann" introduces "att" (index 11), which depends on "fann" and connects to "Sverige" (index 12).
- "var" (index 13) depends on "Sverige" (subject).
- "bland" (index 14) connects which further takes "de" (index 15) and "fem" (index 16) as modifiers for "regioner" (index 17).
- Inside this there is also "dit" (index 18) and "flyttat" (index 19), with "till" (index 20) leading to "mest" (index 21).
- The list at the end, separated by commas, includes elements that have similar dependencies.

Putting these together, we can outline the dependency relationships:

Here's the final dependency tree output:

This representation shows the hierarchical relationships between tokens and their heads, and it includes all relevant tokens, including the punctuation and conjunctions. Each token has its index, its linguistic identity, and the index of its head token, correctly representing the dependencies in the sentence.
