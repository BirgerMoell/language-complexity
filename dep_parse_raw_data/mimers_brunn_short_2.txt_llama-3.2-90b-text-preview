To create a dependency tree for the given Swedish sentence, we first need to analyze its structure. 

The sentence can be broken down as follows:

- "Efter 2:a världskriget" is a subordinate clause indicating a time frame, led by the preposition "Efter" (After).
- "så bestämde sig" is an expression for "then decided" or "decided then".
- "51 länder" is the subject.
- "att bilda FN" is an infinitive clause indicating the action or decision taken by the subject.
- "Förenta nationerna" is a parenthetical phrase explaining what FN is, although technically, a translation of it, as FN stands for 'Förenta nationerna' in Swedish.
- The sentence is punctuated by a comma and a full stop.

Now, let's assign token indices to the sentence and create a dependency tree.

The sentence with tokens and indices is:

[(1, Efter), (2, 2:a), (3, världskriget), (4, så), (5, bestämde), (6, sig), (7, 51), (8, länder), (9, att), (10, bilda), (11, FN), (12, ,), (13, Förenta), (14, nationerna), (15, .)]


Here is the dependency tree for the given sentence:
[(1, Efter, 2), (2, 2:a, 1), (3, världskriget, 1), (4, så, 5), (5, bestämde, 0), (6, sig, 5), (7, 51, 8), (8, länder, 5), (9, att, 10), (10, bilda, 8), (11, FN, 10), (12, ',', 11), (13, Förenta, 14), (14, nationerna, 11), (15, '.', 14)]
