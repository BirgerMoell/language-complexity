To analyze the provided Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we can break down the sentence as follows:

Given sentence: "På morgonen och lite in på dagen avdunstar vattnet ifrån Atlanten som senare regnar ned på eftermiddagen."

The dependency tree representation will be:

1. **Index** of token: The position of the token in the sentence.
2. **Token** itself: The word or punctuation.
3. **Head index**: The index of the token that serves as the syntactic head.

Resulting dependency tree:

```
[
    (1, På, 2),
    (2, morgonen, 5),
    (3, och, 5),
    (4, lite, 5),
    (5, in, 6),
    (6, på, 7),
    (7, dagen, 12),
    (8, avdunstar, 12),
    (9, vattnet, 8),
    (10, ifrån, 11),
    (11, Atlanten, 9),
    (12, som, 14),
    (13, senare, 14),
    (14, regnar, 0),
    (15, ned, 14),
    (16, på, 17),
    (17, eftermiddagen, 14)
]
```

Here's the breakdown of dependencies:
- "På" (at) modifies "morgonen" (the morning) as a prepositional phrase.
- "och" (and), "lite" (a bit), and "in" (inside) also modify the phrase leading to "dagen" (the day).
- "avdunstar" (evaporates) is the main verb and heads the phrase about "vattnet" (the water).
- "ifran" (from) and "Atlanten" (the Atlantic) indicate origin.
- "som" (which) introduces a relative clause describing "vattnet" and its association with the verb "regnar" (rains), which is modified by "senare" (later) and "ned" (down).
- "på" again serves as a preposition for "eftermiddagen" (afternoon). 

This analysis illustrates the relationships between the words in the sentence, forming a syntactic structure.
