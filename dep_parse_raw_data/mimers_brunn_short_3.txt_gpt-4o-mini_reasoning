To produce a dependency tree from the given Swedish sentence, "På morgonen och lite in på dagen avdunstar vattnet ifrån Atlanten som senare regnar ned på eftermiddagen," I will first analyze the structure of the sentence by identifying the components and their grammatical relationships. 

1. **Identifying Tokens**: I'll break the sentence down into its components (tokens):
   - "På" (preposition)
   - "morgonen" (noun)
   - "och" (conjunction)
   - "lite" (adverb)
   - "in" (preposition)
   - "på" (preposition)
   - "dagen" (noun)
   - "avdunstar" (verb)
   - "vattnet" (noun)
   - "ifrån" (preposition)
   - "Atlanten" (noun)
   - "som" (relative pronoun)
   - "senare" (adverb)
   - "regnar" (verb)
   - "ned" (adverb)
   - "på" (preposition)
   - "eftermiddagen" (noun)
   
2. **Establishing Grammatical Relationships**: The main verb is "avdunstar", which has "vattnet" as its subject. This verb connects to other parts of the sentence as follows:
   - "På morgonen" functions as a prepositional phrase indicating the time.
   - "och lite in på dagen" adds additional timing context and incorporates "och".
   - The phrase "ifrån Atlanten" gives the source of something related to the water ("vattnet").
   - The clause beginning with "som" includes additional information about "vattnet", leading to "regnar" indicating what happens later.

3. **Constructing the Dependency Tree**: Now I'll assign indices and establish head relationships based on the structure:
   - "avdunstar" is the root (index 2).
   - "vattnet" as the subject points to "avdunstar".
   - "morgonen" and "dagen" will point to their respective prepositions.
   - "atlanten" will point to "ifrån".
   - "som" introduces a clause, pointing to "vattnet".
   - "senare" modifies "regnar".
   - The adverbs and prepositions will connect to the words they modify.

Here’s the final dependency structure:

``` 
[(1, På, 2), 
 (2, avdunstar, 0),
 (3, morgonen, 1),
 (4, och, 2),
 (5, lite, 6),
 (6, in, 4),
 (7, dagen, 6),
 (8, vattnet, 2),
 (9, ifrån, 8),
 (10, Atlanten, 9),
 (11, som, 10),
 (12, senare, 11),
 (13, regnar, 12),
 (14, ned, 13),
 (15, på, 14),
 (16, eftermiddagen, 15)]
```

This output represents the structure relating the tokens where, for each token, the number indicates its position in the sentence, the token itself is the word, and the final number indicates which token it is dependent on (with `0` meant for the root).
