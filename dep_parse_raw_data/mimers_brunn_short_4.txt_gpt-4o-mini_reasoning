To create a dependency tree for the provided Swedish sentence, I will analyze its structure step-by-step, identifying the relationships between the words (tokens) and their heads. 

1. **Break down the sentence into tokens**: 
   - "Jag" (I)
   - "skulle" (would)
   - "vilja" (like)
   - "säga" (say)
   - "att" (that)
   - "imperialismen" (imperialism)
   - "började" (began)
   - "så" (so)
   - "långt" (far)
   - "tillbaks" (back)
   - "som" (as)
   - "för2000år" (2000 years)
   - "sedan" (ago)
   - "," (comma)
   - "och" (and)
   - "då" (then)
   - "tänker" (think)
   - "jag" (I)
   - "främst" (primarily)
   - "på" (on)
   - "rommarna" (the Romans)
   - "som" (who)
   - "hade" (had)
   - "erövrat" (conquered)
   - "stora" (large)
   - "delar" (parts)
   - "Europa" (Europe)
   - "och" (and)
   - "även" (also)
   - "delar" (parts)
   - "av" (of)
   - "Asien" (Asia)

2. **Analyze the grammatical roles**: 
   - "Jag" is the subject of the verb "skulle" which is a modal verb here modifying "vilja".
   - "vilja" links to "säga" which is the main verb of the clause and takes "att" as a complement.
   - "imperialismen" is the subject of "började", and "började" is the head of the main clause. 
   - The clause "att imperialismen började..." is the content clause of "säga".
   - In the comparative clause "så långt tillbaks som för2000år sedan", "som" introduces a relative clause. 
   - "då" acts as a temporal adverb modifying "tänker".

3. **Establish relations**:
   - Establish the heads for each word based on the grammatical structure.
   - Account for conjunctions and the punctuation.

4. **Construct the dependency tree**:
Using the analysis above, the indexes represent the position of the words in the token list, and the heads represent the dependencies as understood from the grammatical structure.

Here is the resulting dependency tree representation in the required format:

```
[
  (1, Jag, 3), 
  (2, skulle, 3), 
  (3, vilja, 4), 
  (4, säga, 0), 
  (5, att, 4), 
  (6, imperialismen, 7), 
  (7, började, 4), 
  (8, så, 9), 
  (9, långt, 11), 
  (10, tillbaks, 9), 
  (11, som, 13), 
  (12, för2000år, 13), 
  (13, sedan, 7), 
  (14, ,, 4), 
  (15, och, 18), 
  (16, då, 18), 
  (17, tänker, 19), 
  (18, jag, 17), 
  (19, främst, 17), 
  (20, på, 19), 
  (21, rommarna, 20), 
  (22, som, 21), 
  (23, hade, 22), 
  (24, erövrat, 23), 
  (25, stora, 26), 
  (26, delar, 24), 
  (27, Europa, 26), 
  (28, och, 29), 
  (29, även, 26), 
  (30, delar, 28), 
  (31, av, 30), 
  (32, Asien, 31)
]
```

In this output, each token is indexed as per its original position in the sentence, with heads indicating the grammatical relationship as identified during the analysis.
