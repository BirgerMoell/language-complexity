To analyze the provided Swedish sentence and produce a dependency tree, we need to identify the grammatical structure of the sentence and the relationships between the words (tokens). Here’s the breakdown of the process:

1. **Tokenization:** I will split the sentence into individual words and punctuation marks, as each word will be indexed.
  
2. **Identifying Heads:** Each word can depend on another word (its head) based on grammatical rules. For instance, in the sentence "Indataenheter är som det låter", "är" is the main verb, and it depends on "Indataenheter".

3. **Grammatical Relationships:** I will establish which words are heads of which other words. 

After analyzing the provided sentence, we can outline the dependencies as follows:

- "Indataenheter" (input devices) is the subject that leads the sentence.
- "är" (is) serves as the verb and is the root of the sentence.
- "som" (as/which) introduces a relative clause.
- "det" (it) and "låter" (sounds) form a clause with "som", indicating that the "saker" (things) that follow are defined in relation to this clause.
- The phrases "för att skicka in data till datorn" (to send data to the computer) depend on "använda" (use).
- Subsequent phrases are connected with commas and have their respective dependencies reflecting how they connect back to the main verb or subject.

Now that I have a clear structure of the dependencies, below is the constructed dependency tree in the specified format:

```plaintext
[(1, Indataenheter, 2), 
 (2, är, 0), 
 (3, som, 2), 
 (4, det, 3), 
 (5, låter, 3), 
 (6, saker, 2), 
 (7, som, 6), 
 (8, vi, 7), 
 (9, använder, 7), 
 (10, för, 9), 
 (11, att, 10), 
 (12, skicka, 11), 
 (13, in, 12), 
 (14, data, 12), 
 (15, till, 12), 
 (16, datorn, 15), 
 (17, tangentbordet, 2), 
 (18, är, 17), 
 (19, ett, 20), 
 (20, bra, 18), 
 (21, exempel, 19), 
 (22, scanner, 2), 
 (23, och, 22), 
 (24, gamepads, 23), 
 (25, är, 22), 
 (26, två, 27), 
 (27, andra, 26), 
 (28, exempel, 27)]
```

In this output:
- Each entry is structured with the token index, the word, and the index of the corresponding head.
- The structure reflects the grammatical relations and overall flow of the sentence.
