sample.txt,The quantum entanglement of particles exhibits non-local correlations that challenge our classical intuitions about reality.,75.0,"LIX (LÃ¤sbarhetsindex) score is a measure of text complexity. The given text has an extremely high LIX score of 75, which indicates that the text is very complex and not suitable for general readers. The presence of long words like 'entanglement' and 'intuitions' significantly affects the score. This text might be suitable for readers with advanced knowledge in the field of quantum physics or a similar technical background."
