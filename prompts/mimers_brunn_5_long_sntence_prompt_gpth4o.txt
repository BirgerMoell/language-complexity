I would like you to print the dependency parsing result for a given Swedish sentence. Print the result with one word on each row, on the following form: 1, Han, 2, 1 2, köper, 0, 0 3, en, 4, 1 4, bok, 2, 2 where the first number id the word index, the second column is the word itself, the third column is the index of the head word, and the last number is the dependency distance (i.e. the absolute difference between the index and the head word index). The root word should have head word=0 with a distance of 0. Finally, print the average of all the dependency distances in the sentence. Do not use python. Here is the sentence: "Många av de invandrare som kommer till Sverige har inte varit några outbildade bidragstagare i sitt hemland."
