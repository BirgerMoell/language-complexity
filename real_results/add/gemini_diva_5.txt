**Average Dependency Distance:** 1.84

**Explanation:**

- Each row represents a word in the sentence with its index, the word itself, the index of its head word, and the dependency distance.
- The root word ("fann") has a head word index of 0 and a distance of 0.
- The average dependency distance is calculated by summing all the distances and dividing by the number of words.
