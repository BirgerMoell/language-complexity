**Average Dependency Distance:** 2.0

**Explanation:**

- Each row represents a word in the sentence with its dependency information.
- The first column is the word index (starting from 1).
- The second column is the word itself.
- The third column is the index of its head word (the word it depends on).
- The fourth column is the dependency distance (absolute difference between the word index and its head word index).
- The root word ("började") has head word 0 and distance 0.
- The average dependency distance is calculated by summing all distances and dividing by the number of words.
