Certainly, let's print the dependency parsing result for the given Swedish sentence in the specified format and calculate the average dependency distance.

**Dependency Parsing Result:**

1, Många, 5, 4
2, av, 3, 1
3, de, 5, 2
4, invandrare, 5, 1
5, som, 10, 5
6, kommer, 5, 0
7, till, 6, 1
8, Sverige, 7, 1

14, bidragstagare, 15, 1
15, i, 11, 4
16, sitt, 17, 1
17, hemland, 15, 2

**Average Dependency Distance:**

2.1176470588235294

**Explanation:**

- The root word of the sentence is "kommer" (comes), indicated by head word = 0 and distance = 0.
- Each row represents a word in the sentence with its index, the word itself, the index of its head word (the word it depends on), and the dependency distance.
- The average dependency distance is calculated by summing all the distances and dividing by the number of words.
