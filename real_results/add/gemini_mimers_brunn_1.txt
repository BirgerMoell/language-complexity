Certainly, let's parse the Swedish sentence and present the dependency parsing results as requested.

19, största, 20, 1
20, städerna, 16, 4

**Average Dependency Distance:** 2.14

**Explanation:**

- Each row represents a word in the sentence with its dependency information.
- The first column is the word index (starting from 1).
- The second column is the word itself.
- The third column is the index of its head word (the word it depends on).
- The fourth column is the dependency distance (absolute difference between the word index and its head word index).
- The root word ("har") has head word 0 and distance 0.
- The average dependency distance is calculated by summing all distances and dividing by the number of words.
