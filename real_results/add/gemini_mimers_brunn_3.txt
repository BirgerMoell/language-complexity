- Each row represents a word in the sentence with its dependency information.
- The first column is the word index.
- The second column is the word itself.
- The third column is the head word index (the word it depends on).
- The fourth column is the dependency distance (absolute difference between the word index and its head word index).
- The root word ("vattnet") has a head word index of 0 and a dependency distance of 0.

The average dependency distance for this sentence is 1.82. This indicates that, on average, words in this sentence are relatively close to their head words in the dependency structure.
