**Explanation:**

* Each row represents a word in the sentence with its dependency information.
* The first column is the word index.
* The second column is the word itself.
* The third column is the head word index (the word it depends on).
* The fourth column is the dependency distance.
* The root word ("51") has head word 0 and distance 0.
* The average dependency distance is calculated by summing all distances and dividing by the number of words.

Please note that dependency parsing can sometimes have variations depending on the specific parser and linguistic model used. However, the presented result should provide a good understanding of the sentence's grammatical structure.
