Certainly, let's perform dependency parsing on the given Swedish sentence and present the results in the desired format.

**Dependency Parsing Results:**

```
1, Även, 5, 4
2, om, 1, 1
3, det, 5, 2
4, rör, 0, 0
5, sig, 4, 1

**Average Dependency Distance:** 2.4

**Explanation:**

* Each row represents a word in the sentence along with its dependency information.
* The first column is the word index (starting from 1).
* The second column is the word itself.
* The third column is the index of its head word (the word it depends on). 
* The fourth column is the dependency distance (absolute difference between the word's index and its head word's index).
* The root word ("rör" and "lär") has a head word index of 0 and a distance of 0.

The average dependency distance provides a sense of how "spread out" the dependencies are in the sentence. A higher average distance might suggest a more complex sentence structure.
